            </head>
            <p>From the Declaration of Independence until the ratification of the Constitution of 1787, there extended that fascinating span of history which
               included the American Confederation. This was the era when the fledgling democracy strove to gain identity as a united country as it grew from
               the infancy of colonialism into the adolescence of a newly freed nation. During this period of self-discovery, several jurisdictions minted
               copper coins under the authority of the Articles of Confederation. This book is the result of my research into the circumstances surrounding
               those Confederation coinages of <name type="place">Connecticut</name>, <name type="place">Vermont</name>, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>,
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, and <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>. Minted for only a short period of time from 1785 to 1788,
               these series are, nevertheless, specific events within the unfolding numismatic history of <name type="place">British North America</name> which
               extended from the earliest colonial times into the Federal period. To appreciate the proper position of these state coppers in this evolutionary
               sequence, they must be studied in the context of the entire colonial and pre-Federal tradition.</p>
            <p>In 1980, I systematized my newly acquired knowledge concerning colonial coinages and Confederation coppers in a brief monograph which I shared
               with some colleagues who offered constructive criticisms. More material was subsequently gathered and the work rewritten and enlarged. The result
               was that in September 1986, "Money of the American Colonies and Confederation: A Numismatic, Economic and Historical Correlation" was published
               in <hi rend="italic">The Colonial Newsletter</hi> as a preliminary review copy for patrons of that foundation dedicated to early American
               numismatics. The manuscript was reviewed by many members who extended helpful advice and data for inclusion. In February 1988, the corrections,
               additions and suggestions offered by the membership were printed as an emendation in <hi rend="italic">CNL</hi>. Thus, this book owes its very
               being to <name type="pname">James C. Spilman</name>, the editor of <hi rend="italic">CNL</hi>, whose guidance and encouragement steered me
               through the initial stages of this lengthy project. In its final form, this book is sponsored by the American Numismatic Society which has a long
               and distinguished tradition in supporting numismatic research and publications. It is to them I owe my final debt of gratitude for making my
               ambition a reality.</p>
            <p>I have endeavored to describe and analyze the "small change" that jingled in the purses of the American colonists from the very beginnings up
               through 1789 and into the early Federal period. The major emphasis and the focal point of the book, of course, concerns the copper coinages of
               the Confederation, curiosity about which provided the initial stimulus for the entire research. I do not discuss paper currency in detail except
               in the overall context of the prevailing economy. This editorial decision should not infer that colonial paper money is not important, but rather
               that the author does not have a specialized knowledge. Information on this subject is available in the classic reference by <name type="pname"
                  >Eric P. Newman</name>, <hi rend="italic">The Early Paper Money of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
               </hi>.<ref target="#PR1-n1">1</ref> The role of small denominational paper should not be underestimated in the overall colonial monetary
               scene.</p>
            <p>This book emphasizes the fact that numismatics is not limited to the study of the particular characteristics of a selected series of coins but
               rather requires an appreciation and interpretation of contemporary economic and political history during the era in which the coins were current
               as money. This reality is reflected in the selection of the title, <hi rend="italic">Money of the American Colonies and Confederation: A
                  Numismatic, Economic and Historical Correlation</hi>. The word "correlation" in its meaning "a relation of invariable accompaniment," keynotes
               this holistic approach to numismatics which is nicely expressed by <name type="pname">Gabriel Calbeto de Grau</name>. <pb n="10"/>
               <q>Numismatics enjoys world-wide popularity because its technical phase is a Science and its aesthetic phase an Art. It is closely related to
                  History, Geography, and Economics (all of these being major influences on it), as well as such specialized areas as sculpture, Metallurgy,
                  Chemical analysis, and Photography. Both the imaginative mind of the artist and the analytic and disciplined mind of the scholar may find
                  relaxation and pleasure in studying the marvelous elements that make up modern Numismatics.<ref target="#PR1-n2">2</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">De Grau</name> omitted from his definition the technical aspects of minting which are central to the study of early American
               coinages. In regard to "early American coinages," <name type="pname">Spilman</name> notes, "we have the added attraction of a great deal of
               personal history of the coiners and promoters that can be integrated into the Science and Art aspects; and especially their futile attempts to
               make a profit from the coinage of copper!"<ref target="#PR1-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Within the colonial and later Confederation periods, the circulation of currency was influenced by variable exchange rates and other economic
               pressures which varied from place to place and from time to time. It requires an appreciation and knowledge of these exchange rates and other
               monetary influences to answer many of the questions generated about the coins encountered in the period under study. In the preparation of this
               monograph, I received much help and encouragement from <name type="pname">John J. McCusker</name>, Professor of History at the <name type="place"
                  >University of Maryland</name>. His work, <hi rend="italic">Money and Exchange in <name type="place">Europe</name> and <name type="place"
                     >America</name>, 1600-1775, A Handbook</hi>, is an excellent resource for providing insights into the circulation of currency, the function
               of specie, exchange rates, bills of exchange, and monies of account, during these times.<ref target="#PR1-n4">4</ref> In my interpretation of
               numismatic history, I have placed much emphasis on the economic issues surrounding the circulation of the currency under discussion. A more
               recent work by <name type="pname">McCusker</name>, in conjunction with Professor <name type="pname">Russell R. Menard</name> of the History
               Department at the <name type="place">University of Minnesota</name>, <hi rend="italic">The Economy of <name type="place">British North
                     America</name>, 1607-1789</hi>, fully interprets the early economic history of our country and provides a basis for an in depth numismatic
                  survey.<ref target="#PR1-n5">5</ref> We cannot lose sight of the fact that in this present study we are examining not only the humble coppers,
               the money of the poor which paid for their daily bread, beer, and ferry tolls, but also the gold and silver specie coin of international exchange
               and domestic commerce.</p>
            <p>My research and analysis have not brought forth any startling revelations, but a few additions or "re-discoveries" to our knowledge have been
               made. A principal contribution may well be to foster further research into the most common copper of the period which has been ignored by all
               except a few writers. The counterfeit English halfpence, including those manufactured in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> as well as those
               imported from <name type="place">England</name>, formed the bulk of the small change medium, a fact confirmed repeatedly in contemporary
               newspaper accounts. Since <name type="place">Colonial America</name> lacked a uniform coinage, it can be accurately stated that any world coin of
               the period could have shown up and circulated in the colonies and probably <hi rend="italic">did</hi> at one time or another. The recovery of
               such pieces in old accumulations or hoards is to be anticipated, but unless found in sufficient numbers, does not imply that these issues formed
               a significant portion of the colonial currency, hence their appearance in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> is inconsequential to our study. I
               have listed those coins which are properly included as an American currency when such a conclusion is supported by historical evidence.</p>
            <p>Another area of great personal interest deals with overstruck coins. I have delved into this subject at great length and now understand quite
               clearly the purpose of such a seemingly irregular activity. Appendix 2 lists all recorded overstruck coins of which I am aware. Also I read all
               available newspapers from the summer of 1789 which provided me many new insights <pb n="11"/> into the collapse of the copper medium which I have
               shared in Chapter 8. The major theme on which I have concentrated throughout this book is that the coins described were once money and as such
               circulated as the currency of the period. An understanding of their function as currency combines many otherwise loose and seemingly unrelated
               facts into a coherent perception of early American money.</p>
            <p>There are many other people to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for their prior works and research which I used in my correlation and synopsis of
               this subject. While all of these individuals are cited in the footnotes and appear in the bibliography, there are three important works which
               deserve special mention. The first of these is, of course, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64367052">Sylvester S. Crosby</name>'s classic, <hi rend="italic">The Early
                  Coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
               </hi>, first published in 1873 and made available to modern readers in reprint form by Quarterman Publications.<ref target="#PR1-n6">6</ref> The
               next most important single reference is the 1976 American Numismatic Society publication, <hi rend="italic">Studies on Money in Early <name
                     type="place">America</name>
               </hi>, featuring monographs by distinguished scholars on many aspects of colonial numismatics on which I have attempted to expand. Additionally
               every student of this period should be familiar with The Colonial Newsletter Foundation, Inc. of <name type="place">Huntsville</name>, <name
                  type="place">Alabama</name>, a non-profit organization which sponsors research and education in early American numismatics. Its publication,
                  <hi rend="italic">The Colonial Newsletter</hi>, edited under the able direction of <name type="pname">James C. Spilman</name>, features many
               outstanding contributions on this subject and was widely consulted and quoted in the preparation of this book.<ref target="#PR1-n7">7</ref>

            <p>In addition to those previously mentioned, I wish to acknowledge the help of others who assisted me at various stages of this manuscript. In
               particular, three individuals, <name type="pname">Raymond H. Williamson</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64112980">Eric P. Newman</name>, and <name type="pname"
                  >Michael Hodder</name>, generously devoted large segments of their time and wisdom to this project and made available to me reference

               several of the early American prints which illustrate the text. This project could never have been accomplished without aid from the staff of the
               Library of the American Numismatic Association, the source of most of the literary materials. Other hard-to-find references were obtained for me

            <p>I hope this book will be of help to others who share my passion for this period of history and numismatics. There are many gaps in our knowledge
               and we may be seduced into speculation about what might have been and make unwarranted assertions. I have intended to remain conservative, but no
               doubt have been guilty of perpetuating traditional inaccuracies or inventing some of my own. I have always been impressed by the couplet first
               introduced to the numismatic community by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64367052">Sylvester S. Crosby</name> in 1875,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,</l>
               <l>Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.<ref target="#PR1-n8">8</ref>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>This tells the story of my manuscript as well. I have made every attempt to summarize accurately existing facts, while at the same time identify
               those areas of speculation and hypothesis. Since the study of this period of history is hampered by incomplete or non-existent contemporary
               records, the challenge remains for students of this era, from multiple disciplines, to narrow these gaps in knowledge by continuing research into
               these mysteries. While writing this manuscript I remained mindful of the warning of the eminent historian <name type="pname">Joseph A.
                  Ernst</name>; "To avoid a quagmire of unfounded generalities, the student of colonial currency must remain true to the facts, and prudent
               where there are none."<ref target="#PR1-n9">9</ref> With this admonition in mind, the story begins.</p>

                  American</name> Colonies</head>
            <p>Less than five years following the ratification of the Constitution of 1787, the first regular coinages of the <name type="place">United
                  States</name> were struck at the new <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> mint. There had been much deliberation, with many discarded
               proposals, before the Federal coinage system assumed its final form. The architects of the new government had considered the experiences of the
               prior colonial and Confederation periods in the construction of their monetary plan. While in that first year, 1793, only copper cents and half
               cents were issued, these were soon followed by the silver and gold coins of the new republic.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This book is the story of the early currency of <name type="place">British North America</name> prior to the establishment of the Federal Mint.
               The pervasive theme of this study is that money, in whatever form‚Äîbe it commodities, wampum, coin or paper‚Äîmust be understood in the context of a
               circulating medium of exchange. This holistic approach to numismatics requires an appreciation of the prevailing economic, political, and
               historical factors which shaped the environment in which the money was current. Without such an awareness, the coinages of this fascinating era
               are reduced to interesting specimens in collectors' cabinets rather than active players in the living history of our national tradition.</p>
            <p>The currency of pre-Federal <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> lacked uniformity with the majority of hard coin from Spanish American sources,
               while small copper coins were of English origin. Monetary exchange rates between the colonies themselves, and between the plantations and other
               world markets varied, a factor which complicated commerce. While the ready availability of hard coin fluctuated because of cyclical inflationary
               and recessionary periods, there was a chronic shortage of small denominational currency for daily business. The monetary history of this period
               is concerned with the various foreign coinages‚Äîgold, silver, and copper‚Äîwhich circulated in <name type="place">British North America</name> and
               the several actions initiated by the colonists to supplement contracting money supplies during economic bad times. Despite these fiscal
               encumbrances, the local economy prospered and finally, for a variety of reasons, the rebellious colonies became their own master. After
               independence, foreign specie coins remained scarce while the copper money supply continued to expand by the proliferation of both domestic and
               imported issues, many of which were counterfeit. During the Confederation, the small change medium became so overburdened with both legal and
               counterfeit coins, that coppers ceased to circulate during the summer of 1789. The <name type="place">United States</name> gradually emerged from
               the stranglehold of the post-Revolutionary War depression just as copper money began to circulate again and the new Federal Mint was becoming a
               reality. This is the point where our story ends.</p>

                  <p>An appropriate starting place for this narrative about the money of pre-Federal <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> is an account of the
                     colonization of <name type="place">British North America</name> and the developing relationship <pb n="30"/> between <name type="place"
                        >England</name> and her plantations. It was in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that <name type="place">England</name> had joined
                     its maritime neighbors in a race to lay claim to the treasures of the New World. Although the impression is given that the early North
                     American colonists were persecuted emigrants fleeing their homeland for religious and political reasons, this romantic view is not entirely
                     accurate, since there were significant economic factors in the development of the new frontier. <name type="place">England</name> viewed
                     these colonies jealously, but not as a sanctuary for its restless, adventurers, or oppressed. On the contrary, the colonies were a valued
                     economic asset to an island nation with limited natural wealth. Over the years they were cultivated as a source of raw materials for
                     English manufacturing and later as an important marketplace for finished goods. As American exports to the mother country increased, any
                     excess could then be sold in <name type="place">Europe</name> to profit English merchants. The settlement and development of the North
                     American colonies followed a series of restrictive covenants imposed by <name type="place">England</name> which were designed to control
                     all aspects of economic growth, trade, and development. Such strict regulation of the provincial and national economies is embodied in the
                     theory of "mercantilism," a system designed to increase national wealth by decreasing reliance on foreign powers for raw materials and by
                     securing a favorable balance of trade. The increased wealth and prosperity translated directly into bolstered national security and
                     military power. The ultimate objective of all mercantilist powers was to manipulate their colonies in whatever ways necessary so that all
                     possible wealth or advantage gleaned from their overseas territories would accrue to the benefit of the mother country.</p>
                  <p>Colonization of <name type="place">British North America</name> proceeded under the principles of mercantilism whereby the colonies were
                     expected to buy English goods for which they paid by selling raw products to <name type="place">England</name> to supply her factories.
                     "The trade should employ English merchants and vessels, thereby providing freights, profits and interest. These were the three pillars of
                     colonial policy designed to support the mercantile edifice of state security and private profit."<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> Foreign
                     competition was virtually eliminated while at the same time, colonial manufacturing was restricted. The colonial trade policy and <name
                        type="place">England</name>'s mercantile system in general were governed by the English Board of Trade, a governmental department
                     concerned with the promotion of domestic and foreign commerce and the administration of colonial departments particularly in matters
                     relative to the development, expansion, and protection of trade.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> This agency promulgated regulations and
                     sponsored certain legislation in Parliament, the Acts of Trade and Navigation, a series of laws designed to exert a continued control over
                     colonial commerce and raw materials by maintaining permanent colonial dependence on English manufactured goods and shipping.<ref
                        target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> Although these Acts were designed to strengthen English mercantilism, the colonists also prospered under their
                     structure since competition from rival <name type="place">Dutch</name> merchants was removed.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> Prior to 1761, a
                     total of 29 such laws was passed but many were difficult to enforce, virtually ignored, or effectively circumvented by experienced American
                     smugglers. While in "theory and definition" these Acts of Trade and Navigation "appeared rigid and uncompromising, they were in practice
                     elastic and adjustable and did not seriously interfere with the growth and prosperity of the colonies" until after the French and Indian
                        Wars.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> At that point <name type="place">England</name> assumed a firmer stance toward her colonies as
                     evidenced by the stricter Navigation Acts following 1763. These more stringent regulations have been cited as a cause of the American
                     Revolution because of the growing resentment toward British restraint of colonial <pb n="31"/> trade.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> Even
                     when all aspects of the Navigation Acts and the other impositions of mercantilism are considered, it becomes apparent that the balance of
                     benefit swung in the favor of the colonies. Despite her attempt to exert full control, the mother country was unable to stifle the
                     emergence of a colonial-based economy.<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> Moreover, <name type="place">England</name> had failed to recognize
                     "that the Colonies had changed from infants into adolescents, and would now have to be handled by their mother-country with supreme tact if
                     harmony was to be maintained."<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> Lacking this insight, <name type="place">England</name> witnessed a
                     deterioration in her relationship with the colonies, culminating in the War of Independence.</p>
                  <p>Despite the controls engineered by the Board of Trade policies, a local prosperity emerged in the colonies. Initially the colonies were
                     sparsely populated, lacked capital, but had an abundance of raw materials; a colonial economy evolved which corresponded closely to the
                     "export-led," "vent for surplus," or "staples approach" model. This economic system was typified by "small domestic markets, limited
                     supplies of labor and capital, and abundant natural resources" which were shipped to <name type="place">England</name> in exchange for
                     manufactured goods required by the colonists. Consequently, more labor and capital were attracted to <name type="place">North
                        America</name> which in turn stimulated further development within the colonial export market. Significant differences in the economic
                     base and growth of the plantation-rich South and the developing frontier regions of the North were the natural consequences of the
                     geographical, demographic, and climatic diversity of the regions. From its very inception, it is clear that <name type="place">British
                        America</name> was not a single economy but rather a series of "distinct regional economies, most of them tied more closely to Great
                        <name type="place">Britain</name> than to each other, and each distinguished from the rest by the goods it produced for export and by
                     the ways it earned credits in the balance of payments." This economic regionalism was responsible for the unequal monetary exchange rates
                     between the various colonial monies of account, a frustration which plagued intercolonial commerce throughout the entire period. This
                     heterogeneity which emerged from the earliest days of settlement spawned a sectionalism which still characterizes the political, social,
                     and economic life of this country.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inherent within the structure of mercantilism was the requirement that colonial manufacturing and foreign trade with nations other than
                        <name type="place">England</name> had to be discouraged, thus preventing the "American plantations" from economic competition with the
                     parent country and ensuring continued subservience as a source of raw materials and a ready market for finished English goods. A natural
                     consequence of this necessity to buy imported English merchandise was the rapid accumulation of a trade deficit since purchases by the
                     colonies for needed manufactured goods exceeded credits derived from the sale of exported commodities. This imbalance affected the North
                     more than the South whose exported agricultural products, tobacco and cotton, were a ready source of income.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref>
                     In a very early attempt to keep hard money at home to circulate locally, the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Bay Colony in 1636
                     imposed a 16.7% tax upon the purchase of certain nonessential imports such as fruit, spice, sugar, liquor, and tobacco. The logic of the
                        <name type="place">Puritan</name> fathers was that indulgence in such luxuries could lead to "disarrangement and detriment to the medium
                     of exchange."<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> However, they moderated the harshness of this pronouncement by exempting from the imposition
                     "such wine as the deacons of the Churches shall buy or procure bona fide for the Churches' publike use."</p>

               <head>MONEY SUPPLY IN THE COLONIES</head>
               <p>There are numerous contemporary reports throughout the colonial period lamenting the fact that the trade deficit with <name type="place"

               <p>Historical convention has perpetuated the supposition that such trade imbalances drained all ready cash from the colonies to pay for imported
                  commodities. The fact is that customs ledgers only tell a portion of the story.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> The accounts failed to give the
                  current price for the goods which cleared the ports since values were quoted at levels current in the late 1690s and did not reflect price
                  changes or the annual inflation rate.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> Although customs house records do not correctly state the actual price of
                  merchandise which passed their portals, such figures do record the volume of trade. Another serious flaw concerning these colonial ledgers is
                  that data were only collected for transactions with <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place">Wales</name> and trade with all
                  other countries ignored. "Invisible" sources of income which would help offset the costs of imported purchases are not enumerated in customs
                  tabulations. Such undocumented income would include monies earned through trade related activities including wages and the use or sale abroad
                  of American ships. The profits derived from smuggling were considerable and, of course, these evaded official attention. While a negative
                  balance of trade existed, it was not as severe as a first glance at existing customs house files would imply. A reevaluation of American
                  colonial balance of payments from trade with <name type="place">Great Britain</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, <name type="place"
                     >Europe</name>, and the <name type="place">West Indies</name>, including both "visible" and "invisible" trade related incomes, discards
                  "the traditional notion of a severe, chronic deficit for the colonies" since the annual imbalance was only in the range of ¬£40,000.<ref

               <p>In their analysis of the colonial money supply, <name type="pname">McCusker</name> and <name type="pname">Menard</name> make the following
                  assessment: <q>A central question is whether the money supply of the colonists was "adequate." To be adequate for the purposes of an economy,
                     money must be both available in sufficient quantities and of a recognized standard to facilitate rather than inhibit its use in the
                     exchange of goods and services. The total quantity of money available to the colonists is unknown since contemporary or modern estimates
                     are few and never include all forms of money. Some speak of the supply of coin, some of public paper, some of both; all omit commodity
                     money and private paper.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, the "available money" supply for local and foreign transactions was more than just hard cash at hand, but also included paper currency,
                  commodities and the credit extended by English merchants.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> Calculations using the estimated per capita income
                  from 1750 to 1775 suggest that within the colonies as a whole, there was an adequate quantity of money.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> While
                  there may have been sufficient gold for large transactions, there existed a shortage of smaller denominational currencies for the daily
                  business transactions of the typical urban householder, or prosperous farmer who had limited access to specie. "We know very little about the
                  real story of the money condition of the vast majority of the common people, because most of them were illiterate and hence left no 'paper
                     trail'."<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> Many, especially those from rural areas, lived at a "subsistence" level without any actual need for
                  money. For them daily commerce was conducted by barter or "work changing," which are other forms of "currency" to be discussed in the
                  following chapter.</p>
               <p>Writing in 1900, <name type="pname">Bullock</name> summarized his findings concerning the availability of specie during the colonial period.
                     <q>Nevertheless complaints of the scarcity of coin and the alleged impossibility of keeping it in circulation remained so common, and have
                     been accepted so complacently by historians, that it will be necessary to present a little of the evidence that proves the presence of a
                     moderate amount of specie in the colonies.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Bullock</name> supported his thesis by quoting sources which related that in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> in
                  1676 "there is a reasonable quantitie of silver money in the colony, but no gold." In 1671 in <name type="place">Maryland</name> there was
                  English, foreign, and <name type="place">Maryland</name> silver. In the period around 1700 there was reported "a great quantity of Spanish
                  money Plate and Bullion" available in <name type="place">Carolina</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>, the Tidewater districts of

                  coin are accompanied by many complaints of scarcity."<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to this question regarding the adequacy of metallic currency during the colonial period, there is indication that specie, while
                  rarely abundant, fluctuated in availability from place to place and from time to time, depending on the prevailing economic conditions. Modern
                  economic research has satisfactorily solved the riddle of the cyclic availability and scarcity of hard currency. Definite times of economic
                  expansion and stagnation within the colonial economy have been identified, particularly in postwar periods, which corresponded to similar
                  activity within the English economy.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> When hard money became scarce during a depression, <pb n="34"/> there was
                  clamor from contemporary observers who decried the shortage of specie and the burden this placed on the public. Perhaps complaints at such
                  times reflected more a shortage of credit than of money. No doubt there was periodic scarcity of circulating hard coin for remittance to <name
                     type="place">England</name> for the purchase of imports, but the fact remains that colonial commerce generally flourished despite periods
                  of cyclic economic decline. Several periods of sluggish economy were more significant than others and influenced the colonial monetary status
                  in ways which will be detailed in subsequent chapters.</p>

               <p>The earliest economic downturn occurred from 1638 to 1644 and has been termed the "first depression in American history." This event, to be
                  described in Chapter Two, was an international rather than a local <name type="place">New England</name> phenomenon. This period saw the start
                  of a gradual "overvaluation" of silver currency, an inflationary measure which extended until the Proclamation of 1704. The subsequent
                  depressions of 1650 to 1655 and 1662 to 1672 followed war with The <name type="place">Netherlands</name>. The next three major periods of
                  slump (1714 to 1716, 1751 to 1755, and 1764 to 1769) coincided with the end of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_805714">Queen Anne</name>'s, <name type="pname">King

                     >England</name> over colonial paper money policies flared during 1751 and 1764 with wide-reaching paper currency reforms in <name
                     type="place">America</name> which are topics in Chapter Four. Many historians examined these hard times and attempted to blame the
                  financial recessions on paper money practices in order to garner support for their own personal opposition to that medium. Typical of this
                  attitude was the opinion advanced by <name type="pname">Douglass</name>, an avowed early eighteenth century foe of paper money, who claimed
                  that silver coin was plentiful in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> until driven out by paper money first issued by the colony in
                     1690.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> It was his interpretation that the availability of hard money was not a problem until the colony
                  resorted to paper money whereupon this inflated medium drove specie out of circulation. This theory will <pb n="35"/> be considered further in
                  Chapter Four. Modern-day scholars have been more objective; in an analysis of contemporaneous commodity price indices, these currency
                  fluctuations have been linked to worldwide business cycles rather than local currency mismanagement.</p>
               <p>At the end of <name type="pname">King George</name>'s War in 1748, <name type="pname">Thomas Hancock</name>, a prominent <name type="place"
                     >Boston</name> merchant and uncle of the Revolutionary War patriot, wrote, "Peace hath put a stop to all our trade"; "money became
                  'monstrously scarce'."<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> The following year, a large amount of Spanish silver was awarded to <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> by Parliament, creating a ready amount of available specie for the province right up until the Revolution. This story
                  will be related in great detail in Chapter Three. An economic slowdown after the French and Indian War was the probable cause for the <name
                     type="place">Massachusetts</name> Council's petition to the House of Commons presented in December 1768 which described the circumstances
                  present in the Bay Colony. <q>The scarcity of money in the Colonies is owing to the balance of their trade with <name type="place">Great
                        Britain</name> being against them; which balance drains them of their money, to the great embarrassment of their trade, the only source
                     of it. This embarrassment is much increased by the regulations of trade, and by the Tax Acts, which draw immediately from trade the money
                     necessary to support it; on the support whereof the payment of the balance aforesaid depends. The exports of the Colonies, all their gold
                     and silver, and their whole powers of remittance, fall short of all the charged value of what they import from <name type="place">Great
                        Britain</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The final depression to occur within the time frame of this book lasted from 1782 to 1789 and equaled in magnitude the Great Depression of
                  1929 to 1933 in terms of decline of the gross national product.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> This period of economic stagnation during the
                  post-Revolutionary War period, which had a notable impact on numismatic history and the hard money supply, is covered in the last four
                  chapters. Rather than ascribe to a chronic, unrelenting shortage of hard money during the entire colonial period, it appears that specie
                  supplies fluctuated depending upon the prevalent economic condition of the time. During war, when there was an increased demand for raw
                  materials, colonial export trade flourished, there was local prosperity, and ample hard money was available to exchange for manufactured goods
                  from <name type="place">England</name>. When peace returned, the foreign markets for colonial exports softened and hard money became scarcer.
                  In order to obtain specie to remit abroad during these recessionary times, the merchants had to pay dearly for it with other currencies to be
                  described in Chapter Two. In such periods of economic decline, hard money for foreign remittance essentially traded as a commodity.<ref
                     target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> Undoubtedly, there was a maldistribution of hard money in favor of the merchant and business populations with
                  most of it being sequestered in the counting houses awaiting shipment to <name type="place">England</name>. When specie was thus unavailable
                  for commerce, a relative shortage was induced. Since all foreign purchases did not require a specie transaction, hard money was not always
                  essential for overseas trade. Nonetheless, the fact remains that there were numerous contemporary complaints recorded about inadequate stocks
                  of silver and gold coin, but the accuracy of such lamentations may be difficult to assess because of the subjectivity of the speaker and the
                  lack of complete records. <name type="pname">McCusker</name> summarizes this hard money "shortage" by suggesting that <q>Complaints about the
                     "dearth of available coin" in the colonies should always be read with the added phrase supplied by the reader: "at 'reasonable' price."<ref
                        target="#CH1-n30">30</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="36"/>
               <p>This is to state that hard coin could always be obtained but the question was whether the buyer was willing to afford the price. <name
                     type="pname">McCusker</name>'s position is well supported by the statement of <name type="pname">Judge Samuel Sewall</name> who spoke of
                  the period when <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> first issued paper currency. <q>I was at making of the first Bills of Credit in the
                     year 1690: They were not made for want of Money; but for want of Money in the Treasury.<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As previously noted, small denominational coins were scarce and at a premium during much of the colonial period. An inventory of hard money
                  reported by <name type="pname">Thomas Hancock</name> was primarily in gold with only a scattering of small coins. "As a result, shopkeepers
                  found great difficulty in providing their customers with small change."<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The same monetary situation was experienced outside the Thirteen Colonies; in <name type="place">Nova Scotia</name> the government had to buy
                  circulating medium, generally Spanish silver coins, on the open market to provide wages and payments.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> Merchants
                  who possessed hard money were reluctant to spend it locally. This is further indication that hard money was available if one had the means to
                  buy it with other currencies, and when one owned it, there was a tendency to hoard it or use it for foreign purchases. Thus while the quantity
                  of money "circulating" in the community was limited, hard coin was not impossible to obtain. Since those who held it, kept it, it was not so
                  much an issue of quantity but of distribution. It was not an "absolute money shortage" but more of a "circulating money shortage," especially
                  for small denominational coins where limited numbers impacted more severely on daily commerce rather than affecting overseas transactions.</p>
               <p>How is this question to be resolved; was there an adequate supply of hard money for the colonists to conduct daily business? Writers of the
                  past century certainly would have insisted there was a troublesome shortage of gold and silver. They would have added that such a deficiency
                  was linked to many of the colonists' economic woes. Since it is human nature to complain about difficult times and take prosperity for
                  granted, history is replete with subjective and anecdotal accounts of money shortages during a depressed economy. Modern historians have cited
                  evidence for an adequate supply of specie whose immediate availability to those who could afford it was directly related to the prevailing
                  economic cycle. During a period of expansion, hard money would have been more plentiful. In a recessionary period, colonists not having access
                  to sufficient coin would have resorted to some non-specie monetary instruments such as commodity monies, paper currency, and other substitutes
                  to be described in the following three chapters.</p>
               <p>Any shortage in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> of hard coin for daily use could not have been alleviated by <name type="place"
                     >England</name> even if she wished since her own coinage was in such a desperate condition. As a result of this situation and her
                  mercantilist policies, the exportation of specie out of <name type="place">England</name> was outlawed, even to the colonies, except for the
                  payment of its military forces.<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> In spite of this embargo, "there were countless subterfuges and devices for
                  smuggling coin out of the kingdom ... and the state of the silver currency of <name type="place">England</name> in the seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries is ample proof of the failure of this prohibitive legislation."<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref> English coins actively
                  circulated in the colonies as evidenced by their inclusion in contemporary tables of exchange rates. <name type="place">England</name> and her
                  American colonies had no natural source of precious metals and depended on the wealth of the Spanish American mines from the profitable trade
                  via the <name type="place">West Indies</name>. Despite shortages of coin for daily commerce, the English government would never sanction the
                  establishment of a <pb n="37"/> colonial mint, or develop a uniform coinage system, except for the feeble attempt of the Proclamation of 1704.
                  For <name type="place">England</name> to have inaugurated a colonial currency would have been contrary to the tenets of mercantilism since it
                  would have encouraged specie to flow out of the realm if special coins had been minted for colonial use. <name type="place">England</name>'s
                  monetary policy toward its plantations was simple: assure that the net drift of gold and silver was from the colonies to the mother
                     country.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> Thus the <name type="place">North American</name> Plantations remained obliged to depend on foreign
                  coin, especially Spanish American silver, as their source of circulating specie. The local money supply was not reliably stable since, during
                  periods of recession, hard coin was tight and specie was in great demand for foreign purchases. Even during the best of times, low
                  denominational coins were never abundant for daily use and this dearth of circulating hard currency became a chronic, continuing grievance of
                  the American colonists and a theme central in the study of contemporary economic, political, and numismatic history.</p>

               Coin</head>
            <p>In the previous chapter it was concluded that throughout the colonial period there were adequate, although never excessive, hard money supplies
               except during the difficult periods of postwar economic slump or frank depression. The problem was that this coin money was expensive, traded as
               a commodity, commanded a premium, and so was not readily available for everyday commerce. While large denomination specie could be "bought,"
               there was a shortage of lower denomination currency for everyday business transactions even in good times. Undoubtedly this monetary situation
               was an inconvenience to the colonists but certainly it came as no great surprise since most had emigrated from <name type="place">England</name>
               where they were well accustomed to the vexations of a defective national currency as this chapter will reveal. In order to provide for daily
               money needs, it was necessary to create some additional monetary systems which could substitute for hard coin if domestic commerce were to
               proceed.</p>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e9094" type="section">
               <head>A DESCRIPTION OF "MONEY"</head>
               <p>To begin, it is necessary to resolve what is encompassed by the term <hi rend="italic">money</hi>. The definition of money, or currency, would
                  be very restrictive if it only included "hard coin," or specie. <name type="pname">Joseph B. Felt</name> in the introduction to his classic
                  work, <hi rend="italic">An Historical Account of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Currency</hi>, asserted that: <q>Currency ... denotes
                     whatever has been adopted, as a medium of exchange, by general consent and practice.... It is well known, that substances, adopted as a
                     medium of circulation or standard value, have been essentially different in various ages and nations. In <name type="place">Italy</name>,
                     the ancient mode of estimating articles of property, was by cattle. Hence, the word, "pecunia," in their language, was from pecus, flock or
                     herd; though it has long been translated, money.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Felt</name> offered other examples, through both the ancient and modern worlds, of how various materials, including those
                  "of the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms," served as currency in different countries during different eras. Considering this broadened
                  definition of "money" or "currency," one can easily understand how the colonists responded to this lack of "circulating" specie. Their initial
                  reaction was to promote the use of readily available substitutes for coin by the adoption of indigenous Indian wampum, by the barter of goods,
                  commodities and services, and by the use of commodity monies. The next expedient was to expand the pool of circulating hard money by
                  prohibition of its export and by the systematic overvaluation of existing hard coin in terms of local currency. Also, a colonial mint was
                  established in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> to provide a local source of hard money. The final stratagem to introduce a substitute
                  for unavailable hard cash was the development of four systems of paper currency, (a) commodity notes, (b) bills of exchange, (c) land-office
                  (land bank) notes, and (d) bills of credit. Some of these alternatives were more local in scope than others, and while they appeared more or
                  less in <pb n="40"/> succession, some existed simultaneously "and the adoption of a later, perhaps more sophisticated device did not
                  necessarily mean the abandonment of an earlier one."<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Circulating media other than hard coin are referred to as "money substitutes."<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> If we accept the definition
                  proposed by <name type="pname">Felt</name> that "money" can be anything upon which we agree, it is inconsistent to speak of "money
                  substitutes" for such items as wampum and commodities for which specific values have been assigned by popular consent. While wampum,
                  commodities, and the like may well be considered substitutes for "hard coin," they are, indeed, just another "species" of the genus "money,"
                  and are a currency in their own right.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Money is either "real" or "imaginary." In the colonial era, "real" money invariably referred to metallic coin, while "imaginary" money was a
                  bookkeeping contrivance also called "money of account." Money of account does not exist <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> as a tangible item of
                  value, but is rather a "notational device" where disparate coinage systems can be reconciled into a single monetary standard.<ref
                     target="#CH2-n5">5</ref> For example, in October 1672, the Spanish eight reales or piece-of-eight was valued at six <name type="place">New
                     York</name> shillings.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> The eight reales was an actual "real" coin, whereas the <name type="place">New
                     York</name> shilling did not exist except on paper. It was the local "money of account" or "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> money" in
                  which the current value of the eight reales could be reckoned in relationship to other coin money or other imaginary monies. Money of account
                  was also a useful vehicle for reconciling underweight or clipped coins because their relative values, based on the actual weight of precious
                  metals, could be established.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> While the colonial monies of account were reckoned in the same denominations as
                     <name type="place">England</name>, namely pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings, there was no equality in the value of the currencies
                  used in the mother country and her <name type="place">North American</name> colonies; the only point they had in common was the name of the
                  monetary units. Even among the various colonies themselves, there was no uniformity in the relative values of the several colonial monies of
                  account which could be, and frequently were, different depending on the strength or weakness of the particular colony's local economy. The
                  Spanish American eight reales, which was the monetary standard of the period, had four different value "zones" in colonial <name type="place"

                     type="place">New England</name> colonies, this inconsistency in value of money from one colony to another, as expressed in the local monies
                  of account, was an aggravation which added significant complexity to intercolonial commerce. (See Appendix 1 for calculations in the various
                  monies of account.) The disparity between the rates of exchange from one colony to another, and later among the several states, was a
                  frustration which existed into the Federal period.</p>
               <p>Money is further defined as to its intrinsic worth.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> "Fiduciary" coinage is money whose monetary value exceeds the
                  value of the contained bullion. More specifically, a "subsidiary" coinage refers to fiduciary silver coins, whereas "minor" coins are base
                  metal fiduciary coins. A <pb n="41"/> "token" coinage conveys the idea of a money substitute, and while there may be provisions for its
                  exchange into specie, such tokens usually do not possess inherent legal tender status. "Fractional" coins are a currency in denominations less
                  than the standard silver unit.</p>
               <p>As part of our numismatic heritage and this historical survey, it is of interest to review the derivation of the monetary denominations used
                  for both the real and imaginary systems.<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> Silver pennies date their origin to the beginning of the eighth century,
                  the <name type="place">Middle Anglo-Saxon</name> period, when they were introduced as a currency by <name type="pname">King Offa</name> of
                     <name type="place">Mercia</name>. By the ninth century, silver pennies were prevalent throughout <name type="place">England</name> where
                  they remained the sole denomination for about five centuries. They passed at 240 to a pound, money of account, but their weight was uncertain
                  until defined by a statute of 1266 which stated that each silver penny should weigh "thirty-two wheat corns in the midst of the ear." Further
                  legislation in 1280 redefined the penny's weight to equal 24 grains (of wheat); hence 24 grains came to comprise one penny-weight, abbreviated
                     <hi rend="italic">dwt</hi>. Although the penny was the only silver coin until 1279, these pence were struck with a deeply impressed cross
                  such that they could be broken into two halfpence or into four parts called "fourthings" or farthings. The pound sterling of account
                  (imaginary) was a unit which has been in existence since <name type="place">Anglo-Saxon</name> times and it was the intent that the pound of
                  money, divided into 240 pennies, equal a troy pound of silver. This pound of account was further divided into twelve shillings (also imaginary
                  until the reign of <name type="pname">Henry VII</name>) of twenty silver pennies (real), or twenty shillings of twelve pennies.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> abbreviation for the silver penny (and later the copper and bronze) is from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                     >denarius</hi>, a Roman silver coin. The <hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, as the abbreviation for shilling, is from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                     >solidus</hi>, a Roman gold coin but more importantly a medieval money of account equal to twelve denarii. The Roman unit of weight, <hi
                     rend="italic">libra</hi>, equal to 0.718 lbs., avoirdupois, is the source of the ¬£ in reference to pounds. The term "sterling" refers to
                  English currency in general, but specifically to the standard alloy of 925 parts silver and 75 parts copper. The purity of the silver is its
                  "fineness"; the 92.5% silver content of sterling is otherwise expressed as 925.0 millesimal fineness or .925 fine. "Sterling" originally was
                  the term for a pound weight of English silver pennies but the derivation of the word remains shrouded in mystery.<ref target="#CH2-n10"
                     >10</ref> It has been conjectured that the word comes from the old English word for star, <hi rend="italic">steorra</hi>, indicative of the

               </head>
               <p>When the early colonists were faced with an inadequate supply of coins to meet their currency needs, a natural response was to employ the
                  indigenous currency of the natives, namely Indian wampum. <name type="pname">Wampum</name> was variously known as "sewan, seawan, and
                  seawant," from the <name type="place">Algonquian</name> for "loose beads," and as "roanoke" from the same language for "smoothed shells." In
                  the Narraganset tongue, the name was "wampumpeag, peage, peag, peak and wampum." "Wampumpeag" specifically referred to the white polished
                  shells which were less valuable than the dark purple or black "wampum."<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> The early American explorer, <name
                     type="pname">Jonathan Carver</name>, provided a lucid description of these strings of hand-fashioned shell beads which were used as both
                  ornamentation and money. <q>These belts are made of shells found on the coasts of <name type="place">New-England</name> and <name type="place"
                        >Virginia</name>, which are sawed out into beads of an oblong form, about a quarter of an inch long, and <pb n="42"/> round like other
                     beads. Being strung on leather strings, and several of them sewed neatly together with fine sinewy threads, they then compose what is
                     termed a belt of <name type="pname">Wampum</name>.</q>
                  <q>The shells are generally of two colors, some white and others violet; but the latter are more highly esteemed than the former. They are
                     held in as much estimation by the Indians, as gold, silver, or precious stones, are by Europeans.</q>
                  <q>The belts are composed of ten, twelve, or a greater number of strings, according to the importance of the affair in agitation, or the
                     dignity of the person to whom it is presented. On more trifling occasions, strings of beads are presented by the chiefs to each other, and
                     frequently worn by them about their necks, as a valuable ornament.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>

                  beads of white wampum would pass for one English penny, three beads of black also for a penny, while "one fathom of this their stringed money
                  is worth five shillings."<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> A notation of October 7, 1640 stated, "The want of coin enhances the rate of wampum.

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Wampum</name> achieved and maintained its status as a coveted decoration and desirable currency since it was a highly
                  labor-intensive article whose production costs could easily be translated <pb n="43"/> into other measures of value such as beaver pelts. For
                  ages, the Indians had become very familiar with the amount of work involved in hunting and trapping and so these energies could be directly
                  compared to the time requirements and skills necessary to craft sea shells into wampum. Thus a parity was established over the years between
                  wampum and other local items of value.<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> The value of the wampum was maintained until counterfeit material
                  appeared which was no longer fabricated by the ancient hand-made process; stone, bone, glass, mussel shells, horn, and wood were substituted
                  for the traditional colored shells. The last record of wampum circulating as money was from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in 1701.<ref

               <head>BARTER AND COMMODITY MONIES</head>
               <p>The use of commodities as money was a practice common in the ancient world as well as in Elizabethan <name type="place">England</name> whence
                  the colonists had emigrated and so the introduction of this currency into the New World is not unexpected.<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> The
                  simplest use of commodities in commerce would be in the nature of "barter," or trading agricultural products, staples or other necessities
                  among two or more individuals. Hard money was not necessary within a rural subsistence economy. As the exchange of these goods became more
                  complicated, involved parties "kept running accounts of the money value of the goods traded‚Äîin terms of money of account" through a system
                  described as "bookkeeping barter." No money ever needed to change hands and the sales contract could even be expanded to accommodate a third
                  party in a "triangular transfer of goods."<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref> This account book procedure not only included bartered goods but
                  also services, where physical work was also exchanged, "changing works" in common parlance, for other goods and services particularly within
                  rural areas where cash was less frequently seen and less vital since people lived off the land.<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> Commodities
                  were officially designated by colonial legislatures as legal tender for private debts and taxes according to an established price schedule.
                  Thus, "commodity money" or "country pay," as it was also known, came into being as another system to compensate for the shortage of
                  circulating coins.</p>
               <p>Items which were legitimized at specific values as money included tobacco,<ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> liquor, gunpowder, shot, furs,
                  livestock, lumber, fish, and grain. Problems were encountered with commodity monies when non-marketable, inferior grade merchandise was
                  misrepresented as high quality and passed as "money," while better goods were diverted into the export market where they brought hard coin,
                  foreign credit, or imported products in exchange.<ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> In one effort to control the quality of goods delivered as
                  money, the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> General Court issued an order in 1658 that no man should attempt to pay his taxes in "lank
                     cattle."<ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> Tobacco, which was made the official currency of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> in 1619, was

                  <name type="pname">Baxter</name>, in his description of the business practices of <name type="pname">Thomas Hancock</name> imagines the
                  following scenario as typical of the times: <q>We can guess that the arrival of "country pay" must have put a severe test on a creditor's
                     resourcefulness; on occasion, he might open his door to find a farmer there with rye, corn, wheat, poultry, and a couple of hogs, all of
                     which had to be valued and disposed of as quickly as possible. A number of fates might befall such remittances. Presumedly they were
                     sometimes eaten without further ado by <name type="pname">Thomas</name> and his wife. Often they were handed over to other Bostonians in
                     payment for purchases made locally. But quite frequently they were exported to Newfoundland or the <name type="place">West
                     Indies</name>.... He thus looked upon the meat and fish, not as things to eat or sell, but as another kind of money.... Most of the staple
                     commodities found in <name type="place">New England</name> (pickled pork, corn, molasses, and so on) would serve as commodity money, since
                     they were durable and had well-established markets.<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A further sophistication in the use of commodities as legal tender was the development of commodity notes called "storehouse notes" issued as
                  receipts or in reality certificates of inspection when goods, particularly tobacco, were deposited in official government warehouses.<ref
                     target="#CH2-n31">31</ref>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Sumner</name>, writing in 1874, was quite disparaging of commodity money or barter currency, as he called it, suggesting
                  that its presence drove hard money out of circulation.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref> "The more barter currency was used because money [hard
                  coin] was scarce, the scarcer money became! Prices rose to fit the worst form of payment which the seller might expect."<ref target="#CH2-n33"
                     >33</ref> Even if barter currency were "inferior in status to specie" as <name type="pname">Sumner</name> wrote, and despite its
                  acknowledged shortcomings, such as inconsistent quality and the requirement to provide storage space for bulky and perishable items, it was
                  nonetheless a medium which was relatively stable in value and fulfilled currency needs in one form or another throughout the colonial
                     period.<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref> There were instances where commodity monies were more favorably received than certain colonial paper
                  currencies, particularly those of <name type="place">Rhode Island</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n35">35</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In his analysis of the business records of <name type="pname">Thomas Hancock</name>, <name type="pname">Baxter</name> summarizes his findings
                  by stating... <q>that the New Englanders, deprived alike of cash and satisfactory bank notes, ingeniously filled the gap by devising home-made
                     means of exchange. They had no money; so they built up a barter system based on debits and credits. They had little precious metal; so they
                     backed their notes with beef and pork. They had no banks; so every bookkeeper became a banker.</q>
                  <q>Crude barter is an appallingly clumsy method of carrying on business. If goods had been exchanged only for goods, trade would have slowed
                     down almost to a standstill. But when the New Englanders paid for goods with assignable titles to other goods (relying on money units for
                     reckoning only), the situation improved immeasurably; as a result of this new lubricant, the machinery of commerce could run at a
                     reasonable speed.<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The simultaneous circulation of commodity monies and hard coin necessitated the development of some equivalency rating among the several media
                  and accordingly four different types of payment and price structures evolved.<ref target="#CH2-n37">37</ref> The first monetary system to be
                  described was "money" which was, of course, hard coin and wampum which was used for small change. The second called "pay" or "country pay" was
                  actually the commodity monies legalized by the colonial legislatures for payment of taxes according to a specific schedule. Confusion is drawn
                  into the discussion with the addition of the third interaction known by "Pay as money." This appeared to be commodity money, or "pay," at a
                  one-third discount from the established rate. The relationship between "pay as money" and "pay" was at times unclear, but <name type="pname"
                     >Weiss</name> suggests that this ambiguity might have occurred when the official schedule for commodities differed from the actual market
                     price.<ref target="#CH2-n38">38</ref> The final system for the purchase of goods was <pb n="46"/> aptly called "trusting," or a credit
                  arrangement. Analysis of the price structure in <name type="place">New England</name> in 1693 suggests a ratio of 1:1.33:2 between "money,"
                  "pay as money," and "pay." The distinction between "pay" and "money" was obvious, and hard coin, i.e. "money," was always received
                  preferentially. In <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> the taxpayer was entitled to a one-third discount when tax bills were settled in
                  coin rather than "pay,"<ref target="#CH2-n39">39</ref> while in <name type="place">Connecticut</name> the reduction for specie payment could

               <p>The desirability of coin over commodities was apparent since "pay" required storage and transportation, and was susceptible to spoilage and
                  deterioration. Despite these problems, "pay," or commodity monies maintained relative stability over the years. As the eighteenth century
                  progressed, commodity monies became less necessary and their popularity dwindled.</p>
               <p>In a similar manner, the <name type="place">Dutch</name> colonists regularly supplemented their hard currency with wampum, as a substitute for
                  money, and with beaver pelts as a commodity money. The wampum and beaver "money" depreciated substantially over the years and by 1658 the
                  quotation for the equivalent values of these three "currencies" was in the ratio of 10 guilders in silver coin equal to 15 guilders of beaver
                  equal to 21 guilders of wampum.<ref target="#CH2-n41">41</ref>

                     which seriously affected the local economy and currency. By 1610 the population of the <name type="place">Plymouth Colony</name> was about
                     2,500. Between 1630 and 1640 the population of the neighboring <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Bay Colony had grown to 22,000

                     hard money had been plentiful, having been transported to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> by the emigrating colonists apparently in spite
                     of the specie exportation ban. Hard money did not remain in circulation long since it was soon returned to <name type="place"

                     England</name>. <q>The scarcity of money made a great change in all commerce. Merchants would sell no ware, but for money. Men could not
                        pay their debts, though they had enough. Prices of land and cattle fell soon to one half and less, yea to a third, and after to one

                  <p>Although this depression placed a significant burden on <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, one benefit accrued since the lack of
                     money to buy imports from <name type="place">England</name> obliged the colony to become more self-sufficient and hence a local textile
                     industry was born. Although the product was crude and did not replace fine English cloth, it did transform the colony "from an agricultural
                     to a diversified economy."<ref target="#CH2-n48">48</ref> Such progress was of concern to English merchants.</p>
                  <p>Responses to the economic crisis in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> have already been noted when the General Court increased the
                     rate of wampum by one-third in relationship to the money of account on October 7, 1640.<ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> Commodity money

                  </p>
                  <p>A more successful expedient to increase the supply of hard coin was "the raising of the monies" by the <name type="place"
                        >Massachusetts</name> General Court who increased the value of the monetary standard eight reales from a par of 4s. 6d. to 4s. 8d. and
                     later, on September 8, 1642, to 5s.<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> The "crying-up of money," as it is also known, is merely currency
                     overvaluation, a procedure commonly practiced in <name type="place">Europe</name>. The theory is based on the premise that if coin is more
                     highly valued in one country than another, there will be a natural flow of specie to that state where money has greater value and
                     purchasing power, assuming that prices will not rise rapidly to reach a new equilibrium with the overvalued coin. "For say they, If we do
                     observe these States which do soonest and most raise their Money, we shall find that they do most abound with Money; and that Trader and
                     Manufacturer do most flourish there."<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> This is actually a currency devaluation of the money of account by an
                     overvaluation of silver. As other colonies followed <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> by local overvaluation of silver in terms of
                     regional monies of account, the advantage of the inflated value was lost, and another spiral of overvaluation was triggered. The process of
                     "crying up of money" is illustrated in Table 6 which shows the competitive increase in the rate for the eight reales among the colonies
                     until the early 1700s, at which time all the possible advantage had been gained with this scheme for increasing the pool of local hard
                     currency.</p>
                  <p>There is an interesting account of the "crying up of money" as it occurred in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>. As early as 1631 that
                     colony had considered "raising" the value of coin but records are too fragmentary to ascertain the outcome of that early petition.<ref
                        target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> Definite action was taken in 1645, when the Spanish American eight reales was set at six shillings in local
                     money of account. Ten years later the rate was reduced to five shillings because extensive clipping of Spanish silver coins had reduced the
                     standard eight reales from 420 grains (17.5 dwt) to an average of 384 grains (16 dwt) for circulating specimens. This lowered value for
                     specie in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> "tempted People to export the Coin to other Plantations, where it went for more than it did in

                     the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> currency until he managed to buy up all the lightweight silver he could at five shillings. Then by
                     his own proclamation he "raised" its value to six shillings and thereby profited nicely from his personal speculation and subsequent
                     manipulation of the exchange rates. However, the Governor's advantage was short-lived when he was required to receive his own stipend in
                     inflated silver, at which point he reissued the proclamation restoring the five shilling rate.<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref>

                  <pb n="48"/>
                  <p>While some historians state that colonial legislatures prescribed overvaluation of silver to "attract" more specie into their jurisdiction,
                        <name type="pname">Ernst</name> advances the theory that overvaluation or the "crying up of monies" was in fact a measure to control
                     "the external drain of coin which resulted because of the chronically adverse balance of payments in the trade between the colonies and the
                     mother country whenever the prices of colonial exports were depressed or English credits for colonial economic development fell short of

                  </p>
                  <p>In addition to the local "crying-up of money," another measure enacted to assist in keeping hard coin within the colonies was the
                     prohibition against the export of specie, an action identical to that taken in <name type="place">England</name>. A law was passed in <name
                        type="place">Massachusetts</name> on May 12, 1651, which attempted to keep <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver coins within
                     the colony by imposing "forfeiture of the transgressor's whole estate" for anyone convicted of carrying over 20 <name type="place"
                        >Massachusetts</name> Bay shillings out of the province.<ref target="#CH2-n57">57</ref> A "searcher for money" was appointed for each
                     port of entry. Other colonies shared the concern about the export of hard money from their borders. "An Act for the Advancement of Coin,"
                     enacted in <name type="place">Maryland</name> on November 19, 1686, contained the provision that "persons exporting such Coins so advanced,
                     to forfeit the same, Half to his Lordship, and Half to the Informer."<ref target="#CH2-n58">58</ref> Similarly, there was a ban imposed by
                     the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Legislature on September 24, 1709, restricting the exportation of all foreign coin or bullion, both

                  <p>The silver currency of <name type="place">British North America</name> was in disorder by the end of the seventeenth century. Most of the
                     silver was lightweight from severe clipping and an intact coin was a rarity. Spanish silver generally entered British colonial circulation
                     via <name type="place">Jamaica</name>, the military, naval, and piracy center during the troubled years of the seventeenth century, and
                     from there hard coin was dispersed through the remainder of the West Indian and mainland colonies. In <name type="place">Jamaica</name>,
                     the Spanish real was roughly equivalent to the sixpence and hence the name "Spanish sixpence."<ref target="#CH2-n60">60</ref> This amounted
                     to a devaluation of the eight reales from 4s. 6d. to 4s. in that colony. There developed a rampant practice of clipping the eight reales
                     down to an actual sterling value of 4s. and through this practice, the commerce of <name type="place">British North America</name> became
                     encumbered with lightweight coins. As commented by <name type="pname">Chalmers</name>, "... clipping by the subject was the counterpart of
                     the debasement of coins by the sovereign."<ref target="#CH2-n61">61</ref> To prevent economic loss, the various colonies stipulated that
                     Spanish eight reales pass by weight and schedules of values were published. Not only was colonial commerce disturbed by light coins of
                     varying weight, but the already mutilated money was also "cried up" by the competitive overvaluation of Spanish silver in terms of
                     sterling.</p>
                  <p>This irregularity and inconvenience within the colonial currency system escaped official attention until it became the subject of concern

                     <name type="place">Maryland</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> were in a unfavorable position since their hard money drained

                  </p>
                  <p>Until 1704, the management of colonial currency had been pretty well left to the colonies themselves with the resultant complexity in
                     exchange rates. An attempt was made to resolve these inconveniences by creating a single monetary standard for the colonies through the
                     Royal Proclamation of 1704 (see Table 3). Since this regulation was initiated by the English Board of Trade the motive must be suspect.
                     Rather than inspired by altruism toward the colonists, the authors were much more concerned that there be a stable currency to pay the
                     English merchants. The document listed the comparative values of the most common current world silver coins based on an assay by <name
                        type="pname">Sir Isaac Newton</name>, director of the Royal Mint.<ref target="#CH2-n65">65</ref> This Proclamation dictated that the
                     full weight Spanish American eight reales would pass at 6s. in all the colonies, the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> rate of 1697,
                     but in no case at a value one-third greater than its sterling rate of 4s. 6d., effectively establishing an exchange rate of 133.33:100,
                     colonial money of account to sterling. Fractional and other coins would pass proportionally to their intrinsic silver content and were not
                     tabulated separately. The 133.33:100 ratio directed by the Proclamation of 1704 was not a new concept, having been enacted by <name
                        type="place">France</name> for its Canadian settlements in the seventeenth century.<ref target="#CH2-n66">66</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only <name type="place">Barbados</name>
                     <ref target="#CH2-n67">67</ref> and <name type="place">Maryland</name> complied with the Proclamation, while the other colonies virtually
                     ignored it. <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> openly defied the order and refused to appropriate money for the support of local
                     government which did not conform to the prevaling rate of 155.55:100.<ref target="#CH2-n68">68</ref> This insubordination prompted the
                     Crown to reissue the provisions of the Proclamation as an Act of Parliament in 1707 with the force of law.<ref target="#CH2-n69">69</ref>
                     Resistance to this legislation continued since the overvaluation of hard currency provided cheaper money for payment of debts and
                     maintained a price level which would be reduced if the currency were standardized at a lower rate. The North feared that a reduction in the
                     inflation rate for silver coin would give the South a competitive edge in their quest for hard money.<ref target="#CH2-n70">70</ref>

                        period that coin superseded commodities even in prosperous colonies; in the more backward settlements barter continued to dominate the
                           currency.<ref target="#CH2-n72">72</ref>

                  <p>After the Proclamation of 1704 was enacted as law in 1707, there was no longer any advantage to be gained from the progressive
                     overvaluation of silver. Following this Parliamentary restriction on silver coin, <name type="place">Bermuda</name>
                     <ref target="#CH2-n73">73</ref> and the <name type="place">West Indies</name> resorted to a gold standard since Spanish gold was so readily
                     available and the Proclamation of 1704 carried no restrictions regarding gold. On the mainland, however, the colonies turned to paper money
                     as the next and final expedient to increase currency supplies.<ref target="#CH2-n74">74</ref>

               <head>FOREIGN COIN IN THE COLONIES</head>
               <p>Up to this point there has only been passing reference to the silver and gold money of the period. It is important in our study to determine
                  as accurately as possible the composition of the circulating currency in <name type="place">British North America</name>. The most reliable
                  evidence as to the actual coins which passed from hand to hand in commerce or were shipped abroad to settle large transactions would be from
                  the examination of undisturbed hoards or access to contemporary inventories. The evidence from such tabulations would be "frozen in time," so
                  to speak, and much more representative of the current monetary medium than data derived from coin accumulations whose origins are
                  uncertain.</p>
               <p>One early hoard indicates that English gold and silver, although scarce, were present in the colonies, either brought over by immigrants or
                  otherwise smuggled out of the country. This is apparent from a cache of coins uncovered in 1855 at <name type="place">Richmond's
                  Island</name>, a coastal fishing settlement near <name type="place">Portland</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4971068">Maine</name>. This particular hoard
                  contained some 50 English gold and silver coins dated no later than 1642, an indication of when the coins were hidden.<ref target="#CH2-n75"
                     >75</ref>

                  <p>Fig. 5: An old photograph of surviving specimens from the Castine Hoard.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>An analysis of the Castine Deposit provides only limited clues as to the types of coins current in 1704, the date when this hoard was thought
                  to have been hidden by the French near <name type="place">Castine</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4971068">Maine</name>, who were fleeing the English.<ref
                     target="#CH2-n76">76</ref> Unfortunately, only a fraction of this hoard was ever <pb n="54"/> inventoried, and then after the majority of
                  the coins had been dispersed. The number of coins from the cache is uncertain with the count ranging from 400 to 2,000. As might be expected,
                  French coins were the most numerous, Spanish American cobs the next most common, followed by Belgic and Portuguese issues. A large number of
                  Pine Tree shillings and sixpence was recorded, perhaps as many as 75 of each. Only two English coins, shillings, were encountered in the whole
                  lot. Other countries represented in the find were United Provinces of the <name type="place">Netherlands</name> (lion dollars), <name
                     type="place">Spain</name>, and <name type="place">Brunswick-Luneberg</name>. While interesting, this coin census cannot be considered
                  representative of the British territories but is biased toward the French possessions.</p>
               <p>A cross section of money current in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> is now available from the inventory of coins recently recovered from
                  the wreck of the <hi rend="italic">

                  thirty-six specimens have been reclaimed from the ocean amounting to ¬£33 13s., which is considered the unspent sum remaining after the ship
                  was provisioned. A census of the salvaged currency includes only 8 English coins, 22 Dutch lion dollars or their fractional parts, 5 Spanish
                  pieces, 504 coins from Spanish American mints, and 92 examples of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver. The recovery gives only a
                  qualitative notion of the content of the original allotment since the actual distribution of the coin varieties received by the purser prior
                  to disbursement is unrecorded. In this sample, small denominational issues were well represented.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, an inventory of ¬£1626 10s. 11d. in hard coin conducted by <name type="pname">Thomas Hancock</name> in 1762 revealed that the
                  total value was 80% in large Portuguese gold coins and 18% in English guineas.<ref target="#CH2-n78">78</ref> The remainder was in 15 other
                  smaller gold coins and 33 sundry pieces, most being cut Spanish silver. A single copper halfpenny was found. Such large denominational sums
                  were better suited for overseas remittances rather than for the daily market place.</p>
               <p>Much information about the current world coinage of the period is revealed from assays conducted at the Tower Mint by <name type="pname">Sir
                     Isaac Newton</name> in 1702 and 1717, and that of the Royal Mint in 1740 (see Appendix 3).<ref target="#CH2-n79">79</ref> It was the
                  analysis of world currencies by <name type="pname">Newton</name> in 1702 which provided the basis for the monetary reform as promulgated in
                  the Proclamation of 1704. His 1702 assays tabulated the weight, fineness, and value in sterling currency of some 47 silver and 21 gold major
                  specie coins. Information from this and other sources is listed in Tables 5, 7, 8, and 9 which describe world silver and gold coins, commonly
                  encountered in colonial commerce. Any change from the prescribed alloy should be considered a deliberate manipulation on the part of the mint.
                  Refining techniques for precious metals had been perfected since the Roman days when any variation greater than 1% was significant.<ref

                  <head>Spanish and Spanish American Silver</head>
                  <p>Despite the English heritage of the American colonies, the most important and preponderant coin of the period was, of course, the Spanish
                     American eight reales which had become the world's silver standard. This coin, first minted in <name type="place">Mexico City</name> in
                     1535, eventually appeared from many other mints in <name type="place">Central</name> and <name type="place">South America</name>. The
                     earlier coinages were circular but without a protective edge. Beginning in 1556, the style was changed to the so-called "cob," a crude and
                     irregular coin cut from a bar of silver and imperfectly stamped with a design and designation of value on a planchet usually too small to
                     receive the impression from the entire die. The finished specimen was a most primitive product, not for lack of an existing technology to
                     mint more attractive coins, but because the primary purpose of the cob was to provide a convenient means <pb n="55"/> for shipping bullion
                     to the melting pots of <name type="place">Spain</name> rather than to furnish money for general circulation. Although cobs were minted in
                     certain locations up through 1773, the famous pillar dollar, or Spanish milled dollar of eight reales, and its fractional parts, were
                     introduced in 1732. This series was replaced in 1772 by portrait coins bearing the bust of the reigning monarch.<ref target="#CH2-n81"

                  <p>For the period 1497 until 1728 the eight reales was authorized at all mints to weigh 423.9 grains at .9305 fine. There were local
                     exceptions to this provision made in 1642 and 1686 which were applicable to <name type="place">Spain</name> only. According to assays
                     conducted at the Tower Mint in 1626, eight reales weighed 420 grains (17.5 dwt) and were .9166 fine with a pure silver content of 385
                     grains. The sterling equivalent (i.e. English currency value calculated at 62d. per troy ounce for the .925 fine standard) in this
                     circumstance was 53.76d., a value which held quite constant as recorded by other assays through the first quarter of the next century. In
                     1728, the weight of the eight reales was further reduced to 417.6 grains and the fineness lowered to .9166. For a coin adhering to this
                     standard, the value in English currency was essentially unchanged at 53.45d. The eight reales was reduced for the last time in 1772, to
                     .90277 fineness, with a sterling value of 52.64d.<ref target="#CH2-n82">82</ref> For the entire 351 year period from 1497 until 1848,
                     Spanish eight reales minted according to authorized standards, depreciated a meager 4.4%, and for those pieces examined by actual assay,
                     the reduction was only 5.9%.<ref target="#CH2-n83">83</ref> This level of constancy is why Spanish American silver was the revered standard
                     for world currency. <name type="pname">Calbeto de Grau</name> describes the Spanish American coinage and particularly the eight reales
                     piece "as a principal symbol of the world's monetary economy during almost three centuries."<ref target="#CH2-n84">84</ref> These
                     relationships are recorded in Table 5. This uniform value for the Spanish eight reales was also due in part to the stability of the price
                     of sterling silver throughout the period. From 1601 the Tower Mint price for .925 fine standard per <pb n="56"/> troy ounce remained at
                     62d. and was the rate used by <name type="pname">Newton</name> during his tenure of office. On the open market where silver varied 1.5d. to
                     3d. above the Mint price,<ref target="#CH2-n85">85</ref> the price of sterling averaged 64.8d. during the first half of the eighteenth

                        A recoinage of the debased <name type="place">Potos√≠</name> silver was ordered in 1651; the new coins were struck with this different

                  <p>Spanish American silver was not always held in high esteem as evidenced by an uncommon event during the reign of <name type="pname">Philip
                        IV</name> when there "occurred a scandalous falsification in the fineness of silver monies coined in our Peruvian mints."<ref
                        target="#CH2-n87">87</ref> Under the framework of the Spanish colonial system, the mint was essentially a proprietary enterprise
                     purchased by the mintmaster for life and operated under royal license. A fraudulent scheme of coinage debasement, which had been operating
                     for eight years, was uncovered in 1648 involving a silver merchant and an assayer at the <name type="place">Potos√≠</name> mint who were
                     apprehended and two years later condemned to death.<ref target="#CH2-n88">88</ref> Silver coins from that mint depreciated up to 50% in
                     1649. An October 1650 decree ordered that all <name type="place">Potos√≠</name> cobs either be turned in for melting or be counterstamped as
                     an indication of their officially devalued status.<ref target="#CH2-n89">89</ref> Another royal decree of February 17, 1651, ordered a
                     recoinage of the depreciated currency and a change in design to distinguish new issues from the mint of proper weight and standard from the
                     inferior money of the previous decade. Therefore, in 1652 the familiar insignia of the <name type="place">Hapsburg</name> coat of arms was
                     replaced by the "crowned columns of Hercules floating over the waves of the sea." This new emblem on an eight reales became a guarantee
                     that such coins bearing it had returned to the authorized standard. Adulteration of the Peruvian coinage almost caused the demonetization
                     of <name type="place">Potos√≠</name> silver in <name type="place">England</name> and its colonies during the last half of the seventeenth
                     century. An "exact assay" of "base <name type="place">Peru</name>-pieces" performed in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> in 1652 revealed
                     an almost 37% deficiency from the standard.<ref target="#CH2-n90">90</ref> By the end of the century, eight reales examined at the English
                     mint had returned to an English currency equivalence of 53.86d. and there was renewed faith in the standard.</p>
                  <pb n="57"/>
                  <p>The scarcity of hard money was further complicated by the fact that Spanish American silver arriving in the colonies was severely clipped,
                     sweated, filed, shaved, "whirled, slung," or otherwise reduced from its mint weight of 120 grains or 17.5 dwt.<ref target="#CH2-n91"
                        >91</ref> In <name type="place">New England</name> the money of account eight reales was calculated at 15 dwt, in <name type="place"

                     for receiving coins of varying weight adopted in the <name type="place">Leeward Islands</name> was the use of a sliding scale whereby a
                     "cried up" 17 dwt eight reales passed for 7s., a 15 to 17 dwt coin at 6s. 6d., and any piece below 15 dwt at 6s.<ref target="#CH2-n94"

                  </p>
                  <p>Spanish silver eight reales were also cut into fractional pieces to accommodate the need for small change. These eighth parts were called
                     "cut money, sharp change," or "bits" with "two bits" being one-fourth of the Spanish milled dollar, a term which still endures in our
                     language in reference to a quarter of a dollar.<ref target="#CH2-n96">96</ref> A small Spanish American coin of the period, the picayune or
                     half real, was useful as small change both in the colonial and early Federal times. The expression "picayune" was adopted into the English
                     language to denote something of trivial worth. Table 4 lists the common terms for the fractional Spanish silver coins used as small change
                     from colonial times until passage of the Act of February 21, 1857, which demonetized all foreign specie coins. For generations in <name
                        type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, where the real had passed for eleven pence in money of account, the <name type="place">U.S.</name>
                     dime was called a "levy" and a half dime a "fip," a contraction for five pence.<ref target="#CH2-n97">97</ref> In the early Federal period,
                     when the worn real or bit was roughly equivalent to the dime, it was christened a "short-bit" and the picayune became the common name for
                     the half dime.</p>

                  <p>Another small but important coin of the period was the debased silver pistareen (little piastre) or provincial peseta of two reales which
                     was minted in mainland <name type="place">Spain</name> after 1707.<ref target="#CH2-n98">98</ref> This series was officially .8333 fine, or
                     "new plate," as compared to .9305 for the standard eight reales and its fractional parts. Pistareens and their fractional one-half and
                     one-quarter parts were inscribed with the arms of Castile and Le√≥n within their familiar cross on the reverse and the <name type="place"
                        >Hapsburg</name> crest on the obverse. This motif was responsible for the name, "cross pistareen." In 1772 the fineness was reduced to
                     .8125 and the design changed to include the head of the monarch on the obverse and the Castile and Le√≥n crest on the reverse, giving rise
                     to the name, "head pistareen." Although intended solely for use in the Iberian peninsula, these two reales coins traveled rapidly across
                     the Atlantic to the British Colonies, including <name type="place">Nova Scotia</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n99">99</ref>
                     <name type="place">Bermuda</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n100">100</ref> and particularly the <name type="place">West Indies</name> where they
                     became an important "colonial currency for more than a century" passing at five to the Spanish milled dollar. The 20% debasement of this
                     Spanish "new plate" currency as compared to the Spanish American silver coins, protected it from the melting pot which was the frequent
                     fate of coins of lesser alloy, including <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver. Because of lower intrinsic value, pistareens
                     circulated as a subsidiary coinage while higher quality specie from <name type="place">Spanish America</name> was treated as bullion. Lest
                     there be confusion between these two issues, the pistareen was a debased Spanish two reales valued at five to the Spanish milled dollar
                     whereas the Central or South American two reales passed at one-fourth of the standard eight reales or dollar.</p>
                  <p>Because of a ready supply of Spanish gold, the <name type="place">West Indies</name> adopted a gold standard following the Proclamation of
                     1704. Since Spanish American silver was traded more as a commodity than used as money, it was not generally available as a currency. For
                     this reason the debased "new plate" pistareens became important in the West Indian economy since no threat existed that they would be
                     either exported or melted. Hence this humble coin became the small change in an area where it "served for internal and subsidiary
                     circulation under cover of a gold standard."<ref target="#CH2-n101">101</ref> Counterstamped cross and head pistareens are attributed to

                     <p>Fig. 9: A TABLE OF COIN WEIGHTS AND VALUES (ca. 1750). This table, engraved and printed by the silversmith <name type="pname">Nathaniel
                           Hurd</name>, listed the common gold and silver coins and their fractional parts which were current in <name type="place"
                           >Massachusetts</name>. This table was to aid in the redemption of depreciated "Old Tenor" bills, issued prior to 1737, into
                        Proclamation, or "lawfull" money, at the rate of 7¬Ω to 1. This redemption was completed by 1751 after the colony had received sufficient
                        specie from <name type="place">England</name> in 1749 on the <hi rend="italic">

                  <p>The description of this occasion by <name type="pname">Felt</name> also indicates that the "new plate" coinage within the shipment was
                     apparently withheld from circulation until an equitable exchange rate could be calculated. On April 6, 1753, the exchange rate for
                     pistareens in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> was established <pb n="60"/> at 14.5d., at which time the quantity of base Spanish
                     silver from the <hi rend="italic">
                        <name type="place">Mermaid</name>
                     </hi> consignment was released.<ref target="#CH2-n104">104</ref> These newly arrived coins were apparently popular since the colonists
                     chose to receive "the Spanish pistorines at 20 percent over the intrinsic value" in preference to the lesser denominational paper money
                     printed to provide small change at the time of the 1750 redemption of the bills of credit.<ref target="#CH2-n105">105</ref>

                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">American Negotiator</hi> of 1765 printed the following commentary regarding pistareens: <q>All Spanish monies, great
                        or small, either gold or silver, if full Spanish standard weight, are fit to remit to <name type="place">Europe</name>, except a
                        particular sort which circulates in great quantities in the <name type="place">British Sugar Islands</name> which are called Pistareens,
                        whose current value is two ryals. Those pieces of money, if full weight, are not fit to remit to <name type="place">Europe</name>, as
                        they are coarse silver at least 6d. sterling the ounce under standard silver. The blackness of their color is a sufficient mark to
                        distinguish them by.<ref target="#CH2-n106">106</ref>

                  </p>
                  <p>The value of the pistareen was not always constant because the weight varied from 84 to 96 grains and the fineness from .8125 to .842.<ref
                        target="#CH2-n107">107</ref> In 1759, a Spanish pistareen passed at 17.8% and 18.75% (instead of 20%) of a Spanish milled dollar in

                  <p>The pistareen was so well received in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> by the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, when it passed for 15d.,
                     money of account, that the 1s. 3d. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> paper money note of 1775 carried the additional designations of "A

                        >Virginia</name> money to the Spanish milled dollar, the other fractional paper denominations of 30d., 60d., and 90d. coincided to two,
                     four, and six pistareens, respectively, all passing at a rate 20% lower than the Spanish American dollar standard. The status of the
                     pistareen during the late Confederation period in 1786 is outlined in Table 17. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</name>, in his early
                     writings on monetary units, noted: <q>The tenth (of a dollar) will be precisely the Spanish bit or half pistareen in some of the States,
                        and in others will differ from it but by a very small fraction.... Perhaps it would not be amiss to coin three more pieces of silver,
                        one of the value of five-tenths or half a dollar, one of the value of two-tenths, which would be equal to the Spanish pistareen, and one
                        of the value of five coppers, which would be equal to the Spanish half bit.<ref target="#CH2-n111">111</ref>

                  </p>
                  <p>Despite the approval and popularity of the pistareen, the coinage never attained legal tender status in the <name type="place">United
                        States</name> after 1792 although the Spanish milled dollar and its fractional parts remained legal tender until 1857.<ref

                           States</name> vs. <name type="pname">Joseph Gardner</name>
                     </hi>, the defendant was found innocent of the charge of counterfeiting <pb n="61"/> legal currency, since the 100 "head pistareens" he
                     forged were not considered legal coins of the <name type="place">United States</name> and thus no crime was committed. Only the Spanish
                     milled dollar and its fractional parts enjoyed legal tender status pursuant to the presidential proclamation of October 15, 1797. Whereas
                     the role in numismatic history of the eight reales and its fractional parts, including the various sized bits and the picayune, is familiar
                     to modern day collectors, the Spanish pistareen remains an unsung hero among other contemporary Spanish American coinages which circulated
                     widely in the colonies. The pistareen's low silver content afforded it protection from bullion speculators and the export market. Since
                     there was no external competition for the pistareen, it was free to circulate as an important coin within the small change segment of the
                     colonial economy.</p>

                  <p>It has already been mentioned that the Spanish American eight reales became established as the world's silver standard, a measure that
                     applied not only to <name type="place">England</name> but her colonies as well. In <name type="place">England</name> the basis was 54d. but
                     among the colonies this rate was variable which proved vexatious to commerce. The colonial value of the standard was fixed by market forces
                     according to the strength of the local economy and also, as previously described, by legislative edict designed to sustain the currency by
                     "crying-up the money" in a competitive race with neighbors to attract or preserve circulating silver. The Proclamation of 1704 was an
                     unsuccessful attempt to stabilize the currency and control the inflationary spiral precipitated by the "crying up of monies." Following the
                     Proclamation, many colonies resorted to paper money and the rate for silver was unstable and inflated in several others, especially <name
                        type="place">Massachusetts</name> where constancy was not achieved until 1750 after the colony received a large shipment of specie and
                     returned to a silver standard. By about 1750 the exchange rate or par of exchange, for the standard in the colonies settled down and
                     remained constant until the Federal period. A summary of the fluctuating standard for the several colonies is given in Table 6.</p>

                        type="place">South America</name>. The Dutch also became a great commercial nation and had the largest merchant fleet during the

                     intertwined and deserve some brief comment.</p>
                  <p>The Low Countries were successively under the domination of the Dukes of <name type="place">Burgundy</name> beginning in the 1300s and the
                     Austrian <name type="place">Hapsburgs</name> after 1477. When in 1516, <name type="pname">Charles</name> of <name type="place"

                        >Burgundy</name>, including the Low Countries, and <name type="place">Spain</name>, including the New World, were united under the same

                     the Spanish possessions and the Low Countries coming under the rule of his son, <name type="pname">Philip II</name>. The Low Countries,
                     which had always enjoyed a fair degree of autonomy, soon revolted and in 1581 the northern provinces declared themselves independent as the
                     Republic of the Seven United Provinces of The <name type="place">Netherlands</name>. The southern provinces, including <name type="place"
                        >South Brabant</name>, <name type="place">Luxembourg</name>, and <name type="place">Flanders</name> remained under Spanish authority as

                     became a powerful mercantile nation and as such founded the Dutch colony of <name type="place">New Netherland</name> which included parts

                  <p>Much silver from the mines of the New World found its way to the <name type="place">Netherlands</name> via Spanish American and Dutch
                     merchants. The Dutch mints were actively producing coins for the profitable export trade and "some issues never circulated at all within
                     the borders of the country itself."<ref target="#CH2-n114">114</ref> Frequently, there was not enough coined money for use at home and thus
                     many foreign coins were employed in the <name type="place">Netherlands</name> to meet local needs.<ref target="#CH2-n115">115</ref> In the

                     circulated freely in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, along with English and Spanish money, bullion, wampum, and commodities.
                     Specifically the ducatoon of three guilders and the rix-dollar (rijksdaalder) of two and one-half guilders were cited by the <name
                        type="place">Massachusetts</name> General Court on September 8, 1642, when that body established the value of those coins at six and
                     five shillings, respectively, a law which placed the rijksdaalder and the eight reales at par. <q>This Cort [Court] considering the oft

                  <p>Perhaps as a reaction to the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> provision, the Dutch in <name type="place">New Netherland</name>
                     reciprocated by raising the value of the eight reales in their territory to three guilders, a rate 20% higher than at home.<ref

                  <p>The ducatoon (ducatone) was originally a silver coin of three guilders first minted in the Spanish <name type="place">Netherlands</name> in
                     1618, successively displaying the portraits of the monarchs, <name type="pname">Albert</name> and <name type="pname">Isabelle</name>, <name
                        type="pname">Philip IV</name>, and <name type="pname">Charles II</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n121">121</ref> This quality coin was .944
                     fine, weighed 501.23 grains, and passed at 60 sols (stuivers), or three guilders. Beginning in 1659, all seven independent northern United
                     Provinces minted the so-called silver rider, named because of the mounted knight on its obverse. The coin, authorized at 505.86 grains at
                     .941 fine, passed at 63 stuivers. Because of the similarity in size and value with its southern counterpart, the silver rider also became
                     known as a ducatoon. From 1726, ducatoons or silver riders were also minted for the <name type="place">United East India</name> Company as
                     a trade coin with the company's insignia.<ref target="#CH2-n122">122</ref> In addition to the silver rider, alias ducatoon, another
                     important large silver coin was the three guilder piece which passed at 60 stuivers. The silver guilder was an actual coin only from 1544
                     to 1558 and after 1681. In the intervening years, it was a money of account. From 1578, the value of the guilder continually fluctuated,
                     adjusting itself to the value of other silver coins. The value of the guilder was stabilized in 1681 at 148.30 grains, or 200 azen, of pure
                     silver, and its twentieth part, the stuiver, in proportion.<ref target="#CH2-n123">123</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The rijksdaalder was another common Dutch silver piece which by 1581 was minted by most cities and provinces of the Republic. Although
                     attempts were made to standardize this coin, many variations were encountered. The usual weight of the rijksdaalder was 448 grains at .885
                     fine which passed at 50 stuivers, or two and one-half guilders. Another Dutch coin of similar size to the rijksdaalder was the silver
                     ducat, or "leg dollar" (since the right leg of the standing knight is evident), which after 1659, also passed at two and one-half guilders.
                     There were many other <name type="place">German</name> and <name type="place">Scandinavian</name> versions of the rix-dollar, rijksdaalder,
                     reisedaler, or reichstaler rendering the definition of this coin very imprecise. The average value of 13 different "rixdollars" of "the
                     Empire," i.e. the <name type="place">German</name> states, assayed at the Tower mint by <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Newton</name> in 1702
                     revealed a weight 441.96 grains at .886 fine which was comparable to the Dutch issue.<ref target="#CH2-n124">124</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The lion dollar (leeuwendaalder) was probably the most important Dutch coin to circulate in the New World.<ref target="#CH2-n125">125</ref>
                     It was the first coin struck by the United Provinces during their war of independence against <name type="place">Spain</name>. First issued
                     in 1575 in the province of <name type="place">Holland</name>, it was soon minted by all seven provinces and five cities, and was last
                     struck in 1713. It is among the crudest of all the crown-sized coins ever minted to the extent that the lion was mistaken for a dog and,
                     hence, the sobriquet, "dog dollar."<ref target="#CH2-n126">126</ref> This coin had the lowest silver content of all large Dutch silver at
                     .750 fine and a weight of 427.16 grains. It passed initially at a low of 36 stuivers from 1586 to 1606, to a high of 42 in 1659. During the
                     seventeenth century, the lion dollar was primarily a trade coin minted for use in the eastern Mediterranean countries or the Levant. The
                     coin was so popular and successful that it was even copied by several other states, particularly in <name type="place">Germany</name> and
                        <name type="place">Italy</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n127">127</ref> Together with rijksdaalders and silver ducats, lion dollars circulated
                     widely in the <name type="place">Dutch East Indies</name> before the ducatoon became the prevailing currency of the region.<ref
                        target="#CH2-n128">128</ref> In the <pb n="66"/> next century, the lion dollar was displaced as the prominent trade coin of the Levant
                     by the famous and still popular Austrian Maria Theresa taler which first appeared in 1780.<ref target="#CH2-n129">129</ref>

                  <p>As might be expected with any trade coin, the lion dollar made its way to the New World where it was reported to be the "chief metallic
                     currency of <name type="place">Maryland</name> in 1701." It was mentioned again in 1708 as "the only generall coyne among us," with its
                     value set at 4s. 6d.<ref target="#CH2-n130">130</ref> In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in the same year, the rate for the lion dollar
                     was established at 5s. 6d. and the half lion dollar was proportionally set at 2s. 9d.<ref target="#CH2-n131">131</ref> Since the same
                     regulation pegged the eight reales standard at 6s., the lion dollar was significantly overvalued and should only have passed at 4s. 10d. as
                     determined from Tables 5 and 7; the <name type="place">Maryland</name> rate was far more equitable. There is an interesting <name
                        type="place">New York</name> paper money emission dated November 1, 1709, issued in denominations <pb n="67"/> of 20, 16, 8 and 4 "Lyon
                     Dollars" expressed in terms of sterling silver equivalency. The largest bill of this series is for 13.75 ounces of sterling (plate) or 20
                     Lyon Dollars with all others in proportion.<ref target="#CH2-n132">132</ref> This calculates to 6600 grains of sterling for the 20 pieces
                     which is about 2.5% below the expected sterling content of 6767 grains based on <name type="pname">Newton</name>'s assay as recorded in
                     Table 7 and Appendix 3. This reduction in value would be anticipated since the average lion dollar was probably clipped by that amount or

                  <p>The presence of the lion dollar, or "dog dollar," along the Eastern Shore of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> as late as 1696 was due in
                     part to the ineffectiveness of the Navigation Laws to prevent active smuggling by Dutch merchants.<ref target="#CH2-n133">133</ref> The
                     lion dollar also saw significant service in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> and <name type="place">New Jersey</name>. The several

                     lion dollars were recovered in the <name type="place">Castine</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4971068">Maine</name>, hoard hidden in the early 1700s,
                     giving further evidence of their wide circulation.<ref target="#CH2-n134">134</ref> Additional indication of their popularity is suggested
                     by the report that lion dollars were counterfeited in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> in 1701/2.<ref target="#CH2-n135">135</ref>
                     The acceptance of the lion dollar was not a universal phenomenon. In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> in 1677, lion dollars passed at 57d.
                     (Irish) but in proportion to the standard Spanish dollar, were worth only 45d. As a result of this inflated value, no one was required to
                     take these "New lyon Dollars."<ref target="#CH2-n136">136</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The "Cross Dollar of <name type="place">Flanders</name>," or the patagon of the Spanish <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, first minted
                     in 1612 as a "Burgundian rijksdaalder," also received contemporary attention as it was specifically mentioned in the Proclamation of 1704.
                     This interesting coinage, valued at 48 stuivers and bearing the inscriptions of the Spanish king, was so named because of the crossed
                     staves of its design. Its lower silver content, 433.64 grains at .875 fine, tended to drive better coins into the export market. The name
                        <hi rend="italic">patac√≥n</hi> or <hi rend="italic">patagon</hi> was applied to coins of both the Portuguese and Brabantine series, the
                     word having the same derivation as <hi rend="italic">piedfort</hi>, or "large foot," the term commonly applied to heavy pattern or multiple
                     denomination coins.<ref target="#CH2-n137">137</ref> In the <name type="place">Leeward Islands</name>, the "Cross and Lyon dollars, and all
                        <name type="place">Peru</name> Pieces of Eight [i.e. cobs], without weighing" passed at five shillings, a schedule which substantially
                     overvalued the lion dollar.<ref target="#CH2-n138">138</ref> From 1680 to 1712 in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, the eight reales from
                        <name type="place">Spain</name> and <name type="place">Spanish America</name> (exclusive of the "old Peruvians" [i.e. cobs]), all
                     rix-dollars, cross dollars, and French crowns circulated by proclamation at the same rate which varied between 57 and 64d., Irish.
                     According to <name type="pname">Newton</name>, and as it is apparent from the accompanying Tables 5, 6, and 8, this edict overvalued the
                     cross and rix-dollars in terms of the Spanish and French currencies.<ref target="#CH2-n139">139</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another interesting minor Dutch coin was the copper duit, doit, or dite, worth one-half farthing. Eight duits made one stuiver, and 20
                     stuivers equaled one guilder. The word <hi rend="italic">dite</hi> remains in our local language, much like <hi rend="italic"
                     >picayune</hi>, to characterize a trifle or something small.<ref target="#CH2-n140">140</ref>
                     <hi rend="italic">Dite</hi> is not to be confused with <hi rend="italic">mite</hi> (pl. <hi rend="italic">myten</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >miten</hi>), a contemporary copper or billon coin of very little value current in <name type="place">Brabant</name> and the <name
                        type="place">Netherlands</name>. <hi rend="italic">Mite</hi> also has other meanings including 1/20th of a grain as well as being the
                     monetary standard unit of the Spanish <name type="place">Netherlands</name> where 1440 mites equaled a gold real.<ref target="#CH2-n141"

                  <p>The role of Dutch coinage in the American colonies, while certainly not as prominent as the Spanish, is not usually appreciated. <name
                        type="place">New Netherland</name> was a sizeable colony, and although it did not survive under Dutch authority, its money remained an
                     important medium especially in <name type="place">Maryland</name> and along the shores of the Chesapeake where there was continued contact
                     with Dutch merchants. The inclusion of Dutch money in the Proclamation of 1704 together with Spanish, French, and Portuguese silver,
                     suggests that it was considered significant in the colonial economy.</p>

                  <p>From the above schedule, it is evident that the "crying-up of money" had not yet occurred but the weight of the eight reales in common
                     circulation was reduced from 17.5 to 16 dwt indicative of the extensive clipping of the coinage which did not have a protective milled edge
                     until 1732. Silver from the Peruvian mints was depreciated by an additional 20% because of the discovery of debasement at the <name
                        type="place">Potos√≠</name> mint extending from 1640 to 1648. The Dutch dollars, which were at par with the debased Peruvian coinage,
                     were probably lion dollars. Although the export of English specie was prohibited, there were sufficient quantities of crowns and shillings
                     in circulation to warrant their inclusion in published rates of exchange.<ref target="#CH2-n143">143</ref>

                  <p>This tabulation introduces the smallest Spanish gold unit, the <hi rend="italic">escudo</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">shield</hi>, which was
                     equivalent to sixteen reales in silver. Two escudos equaled one <hi rend="italic">pistole</hi>. Originally the double pistole was the
                     Spanish <hi rend="italic">doubloon</hi> of four escudos, but in later usage the doubloon became the quadruple pistole of eight escudos.
                     Another coin mentioned in this early document was the <hi rend="italic">chequin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sequin</hi>, a gold ducat-sized
                     piece common to the Arabic countries bordering on the Mediterranean and introduced into the American colonial trade as the <name

                     passed for two eight reales circulated in the <name type="place">West Indies</name> and the American Colonies in the first half of the
                     eighteenth century but were soon discarded because of their low gold content.</p>
                  <p>Gold coins were relatively unimportant in the American colonies until after the Proclamation of 1701, when gold became the monetary
                     standard in the <name type="place">West Indies</name>. At that point, Spanish doubloons, pistoles, escudos, and Portuguese gold assumed
                     great importance. The <hi rend="italic">moidore</hi> series of Portuguese gold (1640 to 1732) was primarily a European currency where it
                     was the principal gold for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> and <name type="place">Western England</name> during the early eighteenth
                     century. Containing 22 carat gold, the basic unit was the <hi rend="italic">moeda de ouro</hi> (money of gold) of 83 grains. The largest
                     coin in the series was the <hi rend="italic">dobr√£o</hi> of 830 grains, whereas the most familiar coin was its fifth part called the <hi
                        rend="italic">moidore</hi>, double <hi rend="italic">moeda de ouro</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Lisbonine</hi>. This popular coin,
                     originally worth 4,000 r√©is, was inflated to 4,800 r√©is in 1688. The <hi rend="italic">moidore</hi> system was later replaced by the "<name
                        type="pname">Johannes</name>" series (1722 to 1835), so named for the monarch of <name type="place">Portugal</name> whose effigy was on
                     the obverse of the <pb n="70"/> coin. The advantage of these new denominations was their easy conversion to Spanish currency since the <hi
                        rend="italic">
                        <name type="pname">Johannes</name>, <name type="pname">dobra</name>, <name type="pname">joe</name>
                     </hi> or eight Portugese <hi rend="italic">escudos</hi> of 12,800 r√©is was roughly equivalent to the Spanish doubloon or quadruple pistole,
                     although the Portuguese gold was about 5.5% stronger than the corresponding Spanish. The <name type="pname">Johannes</name> series, and
                     particularly the "half joe" of 6,400 r√©is, became an important colonial currency. Portuguese gold was highly prized because of its uniform
                     consistency in both alloy and weight. Such a good reputation "led to the wholesale manufacture of counterfeit joes in <name type="place"

                  <p>Many aspects concerning the circulation and exchange rates in colonial <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> of world monies can be gleaned
                     from the study of the tables in this chapter. The inflated value of the lion dollar in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in 1708, and the
                     overrating of the rix and cross dollars in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> are two examples already mentioned. French currencies are
                     noted to have been very unstable in terms of weight and alloy, whereas Portuguese money, especially gold, was of constant value and highly
                     esteemed. Table 5 demonstrates the stability of the Spanish eight reales and the minor depreciation which occurred over the years accounted
                     for its popularity as a standard. Although it was of a lesser alloy than English coins, its current value was easily calculated by
                     converting its silver content into sterling of .925 fine. The details of this conversion are presented in Appendix 1. The price
                     relationship between silver to gold, as evidenced by the sterling values of the eight reales and the doubloon (Tables 5 and 9), remained
                     about 15.6 to 1 but this ratio varied according to the market forces of supply and demand. Despite the massive imports of silver from South
                     American mines, the great supply was offset by the constant demands for silver by eastern markets which managed to keep the price up.<ref
                        target="#CH2-n149">149</ref> Tables 8 and 9 note that in <name type="place">England</name>, gold was overpriced as compared to silver as
                     demonstrated by the nominal gold guinea of 21s. which would actually command 21s. 6.8d. in silver. Since gold guineas could be converted to
                     silver at a profit, such transactions placed a bounty on full weight English silver coins which were diverted into the bullion market. They
                     virtually disappeared from circulation since they were constantly drained to India where the ratio of value of silver to gold was as high
                     as 9 to 1. <pb n="71"/> The reactive legislation to prevent export of minted specie coins from <name type="place">England</name> was
                     ineffective and the flux of silver to the east continued. These uncurbed market forces were damaging to a mercantilist economy and
                     accounted for the scarcity of full weight domestic hard money in <name type="place">England</name> and the relative absence of English
                     money from its American colonies. Even after the Revolution, English silver was not abundant in <name type="place">North America</name> as

                     <name type="pname">Newton</name> called attention to the fact that the guinea in <name type="place">England</name> was priced up to 1s.
                     above comparable currencies in most of <name type="place">Europe</name> except for <name type="place">Spain</name> and <name type="place"
                        >Portugal</name> where the vast imports of silver arriving from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> made gold relatively more expensive.
                     If bimetallism were to be successful in <name type="place">England</name> so that silver and gold could circulate together, either the
                     official price of silver had to increase or that of gold decrease to maintain the ratio which had been dictated by the law of supply and
                     demand on the world market. In order to preserve the English silver medium from the melting pot and subsequent exportation as bullion,
                        <name type="pname">Newton</name> proposed a devaluation of gold by whatever amount was necessary to correspond with the price of gold in
                     neighboring countries on the Continent. This and other suggestions to preserve and improve English money went ignored and the currency
                     situation in <name type="place">England</name> languished in morbidity until 1816 when the country adopted a gold standard and silver
                     became a subsidiary coinage. Some improvement did result following a proclamation of December 1717 which pegged the guinea at 21s. 0d. and
                     other gold coins proportionately. Although still overrated, the mint price for gold was thereby reduced from ¬£4 to ¬£3 17s. 10.5d. per troy
                        ounce.<ref target="#CH2-n151">151</ref>

                  <p>Thus in the period of <name type="place">British North America</name> colonialism, English currency remained in a lamentable state and the
                     colonists relied on Spanish American, and to a lesser extent Dutch and other European currencies for their commercial needs, since English
                     specie was not available to them. Earlier English monetary history is replete with many accounts of shortages, debasements and recoinages
                     so this was nothing new. Silver had virtually disappeared from <name type="place">England</name> but the available gold, because of its
                     high value in relation to the income of the common people, was not a satisfactory medium for ordinary commerce. When small change was in
                     particularly tight supply, local businessmen resorted to the issue of merchants' tokens redeemable in legal tender. A regal copper coinage
                     was created to fill this need during the reign of <name type="pname">Charles II</name>, but the inherent profit from minting and
                     circulating coppers was so great that counterfeiting <pb n="72"/> became a very lucrative activity for the unscrupulous. Although English
                     specie coins were forbidden to the colonists, counterfeit copper coinage was imported in great quantities to become the most common small

                  <p>N.B. Most sorts of Spanish Silver are sold in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, by the Ounce, and often varies, but seldom or ever exceeds
                     5s. 5d.</p>
                  <p>The par of exchange values for the monies listed in this 1759 table are identical to those from a previous 1751 almanac printed for use in
                        <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n153">153</ref> This is because
                     the rate for the Spanish milled dollar between <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> had stabilized
                     at 100.00:166.67 and between <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> at 100.00:177.78 as indicated in
                     Table 6. The values for the Spanish dollar are represented as 90d. and 96d., in those respective monies of account. Although the weaker
                     pistareen was undervalued here, it can be assumed that fractional Spanish coins passed proportionately. The only new coin appearing in this
                     tabulation is the <pb n="76"/> "French Pistole," the name applied to the <name type="pname">Louis</name> d'Or, or Mirliton, of 1723 to 1726
                     that was slightly lighter than its Spanish counterpart.</p>
                  <p>The 1751 edition of the exchange rate table indicated the minimum permissible weight required for each coin to pass at the determined
                     amount. This allowable reduction from mint weight, made for circulated and lightly clipped specimens, was about 0.5% to 2.6% below the
                     authorized weights for the gold coins listed in Table 9. In addition to this accommodation made for wear and clipping, the gold pieces
                     enumerated in both the 1751 and 1759 almanacs are slightly lower in value than recorded in Table 9 due to the stabilization of the guinea
                     in 1717 at 21s. 0d., when the 22 carat standard was reduced by 2.6% from ¬£4 to ¬£3 17s. 10.5d. an ounce, as previously related. For French
                     crowns, the "least weight" from the 1751 almanac was 414 grains to pass at 7s. 6d., <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money, a
                     tolerance of 5.9% below the 1726 standard of 440 grains listed in Table 8. Except as noted, all other foreign coins in the 1751 and 1759
                     almanacs were rated within two to three percent of their theoretical values from the preceeding tables.<ref target="#CH2-n154">154</ref>
                     Notable exceptions were the French and English crowns; French crowns in <name type="place">England</name> were overvalued by about 4d. but
                     correctly rated in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, whereas English crowns were undervalued
                     in the colonies by 10d. in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> and 10. (id. in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in their local monies
                     of account. This inequitable differential between French and English crowns became an issue of public concern to be further discussed in
                     Chapter Nine. Of course, there was always the option for any underweight coin to pass by weight rather than tale. In 1751 <name
                        type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money, these rates were 8s. 6d. an ounce for sterling quality silver and ¬£6 5s. per ounce for gold.</p>
                  <p>A distinction must be made between the exchange rates for foreign coins in the colonies based on the Spanish standard as noted in Table 6,
                     and the commercial rate charged for bills of exchange with which the colonists could make foreign remittances to pay for imported goods.
                     While the rates which evolved in the exchange of hard money, the par of exchange, were relatively stable and frequently fixed by law, the
                     commercial rates for the purchase of bills of exchange fluctuated more widely according to current business cycles. These variations were
                     determined by many factors such as the availability of foreign credit, the balance of payments, and the relative supply and demand for such
                     fiscal instruments. For example, in 1751, when specie, based on the Spanish standard, passed at a ratio of 100:166.67 between <name
                        type="place">London</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>, the average prevailing price for a bill of exchange for ¬£100
                     sterling was set at ¬£169.86 in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money of account, or expressed as the ratio, 100:169.86.<ref
                        target="#CH2-n155">155</ref> In this instance, it was more expensive to obtain sterling credits by buying a bill of exchange with local
                     money of account than it was to send specie by the next ship to <name type="place">England</name> to cover the indebtedness. In 1759, when
                     market forces had reduced the commercial exchange rate to 100:153.32, it would have been less expensive to have made payments to <name
                        type="place">England</name> using bills of exchange purchased with <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money than to have sent hard
                     money. At any time when it became more profitable to export specie for foreign purchases than to buy bills of exchange, it was said that
                     the "specie export point" had been reached.<ref target="#CH2-n156">156</ref> This subject will be covered in greater depth in Chapter Four
                     where bills of exchange and other paper currencies are described more fully.</p>
                  <p>This chapter has discussed the important emphasis on the intrinsic value of the circulating currencies and their relative exchange rates
                     one with another. If one asks why this is essential to <pb n="77"/> the study of numismatics, the truth becomes immediately apparent. What
                     we cherish in our coin cabinets today as numismatic specimens were the monies of our forebears. As money, these coins had intrinsic value
                     as metal and monetary value as currency; if these two amounts approached parity, then the currency was successful and circulated in
                     commerce. The Spanish milled dollar is the paramount example of such a success. When a coin became more valuable as metal than as money, as
                     was the case for full weight English silver, then the melting pot was its certain fate. The foreign coins which circulated in the colonies
                     did so only because they were supported by their own intrinsic worth and it is vital to the study of numismatics to have an appreciation of
                     that value and how it was derived.</p>

               <p>From a numismatic viewpoint, the most famous solution for increasing the pool of circulating currency in the <name type="place">New
                     England</name> area was the founding of the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Bay mint. Its most well known product, the "Pine Tree
                  Shilling," is familiar to many who have had no more than a passing exposure to colonial history or numismatics. The mint came into existence
                  as a reaction to the lightweight, counterfeit and debased silver coins which appeared in <name type="place">New England</name> very quickly
                  after the initial settlements. The unreliable currency prevalent in the colonies was generally cut, clipped or otherwise underweight Spanish
                  silver that had penetrated mainland commerce via <name type="place">Jamaica</name>, which was the hotbed of piracy and military and naval
                  operations against the Spanish. As described by <name type="pname">Chalmers</name>: <q>It is at any rate certain that by the close of the
                     first half of the 17th century light Spanish coins were being circulated from the <name type="place">West Indies</name> through the
                     Plantations of the New World. And the predominance of these light coins (and counterfeit money), coupled with the inconvenience of barter
                     and of an inadequate medium of circulation, led the colony of <name type="place">New England</name> on 31st May 1652, boldly to set about
                     minting money for itself "of good silver of the just allay of new sterling English mony ...."<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Initially the General Court had responded to this uncertain Spanish money by passing a bill on May 26, 1652, designed to counterstamp all
                  silver coins with a mark of value. It would be a safe speculation that some of this questionable money was from the <name type="place"
                     >Potos√≠</name> scandal of 1648. No evidence exists that the cumbersome scheme to label each legitimate coin was ever initiated. Instead,
                  more definitive legislation a few weeks later authorized a mint for the recoining of Spanish silver, received from the profitable West Indian
                  trade, into a local currency.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_30880042">John Hull</name>, a skillful silversmith, was appointed mintmaster with <name type="pname">Robert Sanderson</name> as his
                  partner. In <name type="pname">Hull</name>'s own words: <q>Upon occasion of much counterfeit coin brought into the country, ... (and that did
                     occasion a stoppage of trade), the General Court ordered a mint to be set up, and coin it, bringing it to the sterling standard for
                     fineness; and, for weight, every shilling to be three pennyweight:<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposed coinage conformed to the newly established colonial standard of 72 grains of .925 fine silver to the shilling. An assay of Pine
                  Tree money done at a later date at the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint indicated a fineness of .926 and an average weight between
                  65 and 67 grains.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> Since the standard English shilling of that period was 92.6 grains, this represented a 22.25%
                  overvaluation of the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> shilling in terms of sterling currency.</p>
               <pb n="80"/>
               <p>The rationale for this inflated rating was to encourage <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> money to circulate only at home and escape
                  exportation. The operation was conducted by patrons bringing "Bullian, Plate, or Spanish Coyne" to the mint where the silver was melted and
                  "brought to the Allay of Starling mony" for which they were given a receipt.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> Spanish silver was authorized at a
                  standard of .9305 fine and if it became necessary to increase the alloy to .925 fine prior to reminting, there was then a potential for gain.
                  The mint was a profitable venture for <name type="pname">Hull</name> and <name type="pname">Sanderson</name>. Under their first contract with
                  the colony, which ran from 1652 to 1667, they received 15 pence for each 20 shillings minted plus an additional allowance of three pence to
                  cover wastage. The commission of 6.25% paid to the mintmaster and his associate was formidable, and when the expense for wastage was included,
                  the mint fee totaled 7.5%. The amount was charged to all those who brought silver to the mint to be recoined. The effective price paid for a
                  shilling included the cost of the intrinsic 72 grains of silver plus the mint charges which equaled another 5.4 grains, bringing the effective
                  total value for every recoined shilling to 12.9d.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The expense incurred in recoining silver at the mint created a significant operational problem since it became more profitable for people to
                  export their silver than to patronize the mint. To complicate further this predicament, newly minted <name type="place">New England</name>,
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name>, or <name type="place">Bay Colony</name> shillings<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref>, as this <name
                     type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver was contemporaneously known, were exported as bullion to <name type="place">Europe</name> where
                  they were melted down.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> In fact, so much coin left the colony that the General Court enacted prohibitions on
                  August 22, 1651, and May 19, 1669, which were reconfirmed on December 21, 1697, allowing for the removal of no more than 20 shillings personal
                  expense money for any departing traveler. "Searchers" were appointed to examine persons, ships, and cargoes at the various ports and
                  "impowered &amp; required to search for and seize all moneys of the Coyne of this Jurisdiction" and were authorized "to breake open any chest,
                  Trunck, Box, Cabbin, Cask, Truss, or any other suspected place or thing where they ... conceiue [conceive] money may be Concealld, &amp; seize
                  the same." Conviction under this new law would result in the forfeiture of the transgressor's entire estate.<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref>

               </p>
               <p>Until 1642, the Spanish eight reales was at par between <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place">England</name>, passing
                  at 4s. 6d. in both locations. As the depression of 1638 began to engulf <name type="place">New England</name> and specie became scarcer, a
                  balance-of-payments crisis emerged as less hard money became available to pay for imported goods. The <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>
                  General Court responded to this financial emergency by overvaluing, i.e. "crying up," the Spanish eight reales to 5s., the rate which was
                  current when the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> mint was established. Since most of the Spanish silver which arrived in <name
                     type="place">New England</name> had already been generously clipped, or otherwise relieved of a portion of its metal, full weight coins
                  were exceptional. Typical eight reales circulating in <name type="place">New England</name> were clipped down to about 15 dwt (360 grains),
                  and in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> to about 12 dwt (288 grains).<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Sumner</name> calculated, based on the actual cost of a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> shilling at 77.4 grains of silver,
                  a full weight Spanish eight reales of 420 grains could be minted into 5s. 4d. 3f. of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> money.<ref
                     target="#CH3-n19">19</ref> The sum would be further modified depending on the assay of the Spanish silver presented to the mint. By this
                  formula, an enterprising colonist could turn a profit of 4d. 3f. on every full weight Spanish eight reales delivered to the mint for
                  recoinage, and even more for coins of greater purity than sterling alloy. The profit margin, of course, was proportionally reduced for the
                  lighter, clipped Spanish silver. All potential financial advantage for sending an eight reales to the mint for recoinage was lost whenever
                  such a coin weighed under 389.18 grains, the break-even point for the scheme. When under that weight, it would be more advantageous to pass
                  the coin as five shillings if anyone would accept a clipped coin at full value.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In 1672 the value of the eight reales piece in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> was "cryed-up" to 6s., a ratio of 100.00:133.33 when
                  compared to sterling equivalence since the same coin still passed at 54d. in <name type="place">England</name>. <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> silver was not advanced beyond face value by this regulation although it had been proposed to increase the shilling
                  to 14d., the sixpence to 7d., the threepence to 4d., and the twopence to 3d.<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref> This overvaluation of Spanish coin
                  still did not keep silver within the colony since it was more profitable to export it than to present it to the mint for recoinage because of
                  additional fees incident to <name type="pname">Hull</name>'s commission. This situation is evidenced by an action of the <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> General Court on October 8, 1672, which begins, "Whereas peeces-of-eight are of more value to carry out of the
                  country then [than] they will yeild [sic] to mint into our coyne, by reason whereof peeces-of-eight which might else come to coyning are

                  were of full weight, contained a provision whereby all circulating Spanish silver be stamped according to its value, as determined by size, at
                  a fee of four pence per 20 shillings. The notion to label all circulating coins with a mark of value is reminiscent of the May 26, 1652
                  legislation, but in neither case does evidence exist that counterstamping was ever conducted and all coins with such counterstamps are
                     forgeries.<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref>

                  <name type="pname">Crosby</name> noted that because these schemes to keep money at home, namely recoinage into <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> silver, stamping with indication of weight and just value, and export prohibition, did not succeed, the final act of
                  desperation for the General Court was to regulate the value of circulating silver. This was done on May 24, 1682, by approval of a provision
                  which pegged the value of Spanish coins of sterling alloy at 6s. 8d. per troy ounce. Thus one ounce, 180 grains, of Spanish silver, worth
                  80d., was now accurately priced according to the same ratio of a <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> shilling of 72 grains passing for
                     12d.<ref target="#CH3-n24">24</ref> Spanish silver was no longer overvalued in terms of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> money to
                  which it was now fixed according to a weight relationship.<ref target="#CH3-n25">25</ref> Subsequent legislation in 1692 and 1697 returned the
                  value of the seventeen pennyweight eight reales again to six shillings and also reaffirmed "that the coyn of the late <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> Colony shall pass currant at the rate it was stampt for."<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref> However, if a Spanish eight
                  reales of seventeen dwt (408 grains) were to pass at 6s. (72d.), then to maintain the proper ratio, the rate for all coins of sterling silver
                  should have been proportionately advanced to 84.7d. per ounce. An interesting inconsistency is that such a proposal to increase the value of
                  silver money to 7s. per ounce was defeated in 1696.<ref target="#CH3-n27">27</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> mint was obviously becoming unpopular due to the relatively high fixed costs paid as commissions to <name
                     type="pname">Hull</name> and <name type="pname">Sanderson</name> and by the fact that Spanish silver could be more <pb n="83"/> profitably
                  disposed of elsewhere. Suggestions, made from 1677 to 1680, were intended to encourage citizens to patronize the mint. These included a
                  reduction in weight of the shilling by nine to twelve grains and a plan to abolish the mint fee entirely as was the practice at the English
                     mint.<ref target="#CH3-n28">28</ref> None of these proposals for revitalization prevailed and the mint was closed in 1682. In addition to
                  fiscal difficulties, the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Bay mint was clearly illegal since minting coins was a royal prerogative
                  denied by charter to all colonies except <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>. Acting under whatever self-justifications they chose, the
                  enterprising colonists took advantage of the interregnum from 1649 to 1660, when <name type="place">England</name> had no monarch during the
                  Commonwealth under <name type="pname">Cromwell</name>, and opened the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> mint. An ingenuous passage written in
                  1684 on the subject of the establishment of the mint claimed innocence from any wrongful actions on the part of <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> authorities who were unaware until 1662 that the mint was "against any Law of <name type="place">England</name>, or
                  against His Majesties Will or pleasure, till of late; but rather that there was tacit allowance &amp; approbation of it."<ref
                     target="#CH3-n29">29</ref> Agitation was recorded in 1665 for the abolition of the mint which was clearly an infringement on the royal
                  privilege once the monarchy had been restored. Rather than disband the mint as the king's commissioners had demanded, the General Court,
                  instead, hoped to appease <name type="pname">Charles II</name> with a gift of masts for his navy with the hope of retaining royal favor.<ref

                     >Sanderson</name> under the second contract. <name type="pname">Sumner</name> speculated that the bargaining position of the partners had

                     <name type="place">England</name> leaving less available to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> mint. The second agreement left the fee

               <p>Four distinct periods of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> shillings are generally recognized: the <name type="place">New England</name>
                  coinage from the inception of the mint on June 11, 1652 until October 19, 1652; the Willow Tree variety struck intermittently until 1660; the
                  Oak Tree variety from 1660 to 1667; and lastly the Pine Tree design from 1667 until 1682 when all mint operations ceased.<ref
                     target="#CH3-n37">37</ref> Although the mint operated from 1652 to 1682, all of the coins are dated 1652, with the single exception of the
                  Oak Tree twopence which bears the date 1662. Traditionally it was thought that the repetitious use of the date 1652 was a ruse to obscure the
                  fact that the mintage was continuous over a long period, and that the twopence was dated, perhaps by error, in the year it was first struck. A
                  more accurate explanation is that all the dies for <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver were engraved with the year in which the

               </p>
               <p>The initial reference to the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver was as "<name type="place">New England</name>," "<name
                     type="place">Boston</name>" or "<name type="place">Bay Colony</name> money"; the term "Pine Tree" was not recorded until the second
                  proposal in 1680 to abolish the mint fee, just two years before the mint was closed.<ref target="#CH3-n39">39</ref> From that time to the
                  early nineteenth century, the phrase "Pine Tree" was a generic reference to all products of the mint. <name type="pname">Felt</name> in 1839
                  illustrated "Pine Tree Money" in which he included an Oak Tree twopence, without any distinction between the Pine Tree and Oak Tree

                  <name type="pname">Prime</name> in 1861 described the <name type="place">New England</name> coinage and its successor, the "Pine-tree

                  Further distinction between the Oak Tree and Willow Tree varieties did not come into usage before 1867. Until that time, the Willow Tree

               <p>The change from the Willow Tree to the Oak Tree varieties was more than an alteration in design, since it also marked a distinct advance in
                  minting technology as evidenced by the employment of some fashion of fixed dies and even striking. The improved manufacturing technique
                  prompted <name type="pname">Noe</name> to theorize the introduction of a screw press by the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> mint since
                  the quality of the Oak Tree series suggested to him that mechanization was now <pb n="87"/> employed.<ref target="#CH3-n53">53</ref> Further
                  research by <name type="pname">Doty</name> confirms that a simple rocker press was used for all Oak Tree pieces and the early Pine Tree
                  series, the screw press being employed at a later date for the small planchet Pine Tree money.<ref target="#CH3-n54">54</ref> The surfaces of
                  well preserved coins, minted by a rocker press, may show a characteristic sinusoidal warping. Parallel bends in some specimens, previously
                  attributed as so-called witch pieces, are actually artifacts caused by the passage of the silver planchet between the opposing dies.</p>
               <p>Within the Oak Tree series appeared the only <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver coin dated other than 1652, namely the 1662 Oak
                  Tree twopence, whose production probably began in that actual year.<ref target="#CH3-n55">55</ref> The enabling legislation stipulated that
                  during the first year of production, ¬£50 worth of the new twopence were to be minted for every ¬£100 of silver coined, and for the next six
                  years, ¬£20 for every ¬£100.<ref target="#CH3-n56">56</ref> This rather ambitious minting schedule was accomplished with a single pair of dies
                  which survived six recuttings without any significant breaks.<ref target="#CH3-n57">57</ref> The added longevity for the twopence dies
                  resulted from the fact that less internal stress occurs within dies which impress smaller, thinner planchets than within those used with
                  larger planchets. The working life of dies is also extended whenever planchets are annealed, or softened by heating, prior to striking, since
                  the metal is rendered more malleable. In the case of the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> mint, it remains unknown whether the
                  annealing process was ever used.<ref target="#CH3-n58">58</ref>

               <p>The transition in design from the Oak Tree to the Pine Tree emblem was gradual. Spiney branches appeared on the Oak Tree shilling now
                  designated <name type="pname">Noe</name> 14 (see <ref target="#fig-44">fig. 18a</ref>), and a common reverse was shared by three Oak Tree

                  The change from the Oak Tree to the Pine Tree motif is thought to have occurred in 1667 when <name type="pname">Hull</name>'s second agreement
                  with the Colony was ratified.<ref target="#CH3-n60">60</ref> The early Pine Tree shillings were struck on large planchets in a rocker press,
                  but the later small planchet issues were minted by a screw press with occasional evidence of double striking. It has been surmised that the
                  small planchet Pine Tree shillings were introduced in 1675, the year when <name type="pname">Hull</name>'s third and last contract was
                     signed.<ref target="#CH3-n61">61</ref> The final agreement ran until 1682 when the mint was closed; <name type="pname">Hull</name> died the

               <p>There is little information on the quantity of "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name>" coins minted over the 30 year span of the mint, except that
                  it was a formidable output. <name type="pname">Felt</name> noted that "the products of its [the mint's] operation were long current in our
                  country. Down to the Revolution of our Independence, they were often seen, and passed readily in business transactions, with other coin."<ref

               </p>
               <p>An interesting collection of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver was salvaged from the 1711 wreck of the <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="pname">H.M.S. Feversham</name>
                  </hi>. Of the 92 specimens recovered, all but 2 were shillings and the census was as follows: 1 <name type="place">New England</name>
                  shilling, 4 Willow Tree shillings, 27 Oak Tree shillings, and 54 Pine Tree shillings, 2 sixpence, and several cut pieces. It is tempting to
                  speculate that this was the appoximate ratio in which these four styles of shillings circulated as a currency in the early eighteenth century.
                  Certainly in the twentieth century, these proportions are in the order of magnitude in which they appear in auction catalogues. Of particular
                  interest were the few' Pine Tree shillings which had been cut into fractional pieces, a practice very common with Spanish silver.</p>
               <p>Contemporary records speak of counterfeit <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> money and those people who attempted to defraud the public by
                  debasing the currency.<ref target="#CH3-n63">63</ref> The earliest documented account was the 1674 conviction of <name type="pname">John du

                     19,<ref target="#CH3-n66">66</ref> are forgeries, as are the Pine Tree shillings designated as <name type="pname">Noe</name> 13, 14, 31,
                  and possibly 12. These pieces are about 65% normal weight and were intentionally made to appear heavily worn and severely clipped and as such
                  masqueraded as widely circulated coins to obscure their true origins.<ref target="#CH3-n67">67</ref> There are numerous other contemporary
                  counterfeits and later day fabrications of Pine Tree money illustrated by <name type="pname">Noe</name> and other more recent writers.<ref
                     target="#CH3-n68">68</ref> It is clear that these questionable pieces are not the work of <name type="pname">Hull</name> and <name
                     type="pname">Sanderson</name> since the crude design of the tree and the amateurish style of the lettering differ substantially from the
                  genuine products. Two recent discoveries have reported fabricated <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver coins struck over Spanish
                  American one real pieces. One is a counterfeit Pine Tree shilling struck over a 1781 Mexican one real,<ref target="#CH3-n69">69</ref> and the
                  second is a <name type="place">New England</name> sixpence over a similar <pb n="89"/> host coin, dated 1772 or later.<ref target="#CH3-n70"
                     >70</ref> The sixpence is a <name type="pname">Noe</name> 4 variety, a combination whose authenticity has been the subject of controversy.
                  Now that these dies have been implicated in an obviously contrived situation, <name type="pname">Noe</name> 4 is confirmed as a forgery, a
                  conclusion first reached by <name type="pname">Newman</name> in 1959 based on other evidence. The problem is to determine which of these coins
                  were contemporary counterfeits made during the last half of the seventeenth century to masquerade as legitimate specimens and which are modern
                  forgeries produced to deceive unwary collectors.</p>

               <p>It is not surprising that money as famous as the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Pine Tree coinage, used in an inclusive sense, has
                  developed its own lore and legends. One famous tale is that <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_30880042">John Hull</name> became so rich from his minting operation that
                  when his daughter, Hannah, married <name type="pname">Judge Samuel Sewall</name> in 1675,<ref target="#CH3-n71">71</ref> her dowry was her
                  weight in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver, some 10,000 coins.<ref target="#CH3-n72">72</ref> Such a sum would place the young
                  bride's weight at almost 103 pounds, avoirdupois, or ¬£500 in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> currency, a tidy sum in its day. This
                  would be equivalent to <name type="pname">Hull</name>'s commission for the manufacture of 160,000 shillings. Another account of this event
                  states that the dowry was some ¬£30,000, obviously not calculated from Hannah's weight!<ref target="#CH3-n73">73</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Another popular story is told of the visit of <name type="pname">Sir Thomas Temple</name>, the Royal Governor of <name type="place">Nova
                     Scotia</name>, to <name type="pname">Charles II</name> in 1662. The anecdote continues that as the two were discussing the affairs of <name
                     type="place">New England</name>, including the illegal mint, the Governor presented the monarch some <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> silver. "Seeing a tree on one of the pieces, <name type="pname">Charles</name> inquired what sort of a tree that was.
                  The immediate reply, it was the royal oak, which preserved his majesty's life.<ref target="#CH3-n74">74</ref> Such an answer brought the king
                  to good humor, and induced him to hear the pleas which the governor made in favor of our colony."<ref target="#CH3-n75">75</ref> Although
                  quoted by some as a "ridiculous story,"<ref target="#CH3-n76">76</ref> it does emphasize the fact that the <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> mint, although illegal, operated for many years with royal knowledge and indifference.</p>
               <p>It has been popularly promoted that New Englanders, during the latter half of the seventeenth century, carried bent silver coins to protect
                  themselves from the evils of witchcraft, a frenzy which had engulfed <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>. Such bent and restraightened
                  coins are called "witch pieces" and it is reported that some still show the teeth marks as an indication of how they were doubled. It is now
                  known that these bends were the result of the rocker press in which the Oak Tree and large planchet Pine Tree shillings were minted. While
                  silver, usually a symbol of purity, has been used in various cultures as a protection from evil and witchcraft,<ref target="#CH3-n77">77</ref>
                  the first recorded <pb n="90"/> mention of the bent silver coin superstition in American numismatic literature is credited to <name

                  authentication from contemporary sources, it is ironic that the presiding judge at the <name type="place">Salem</name> witch trials of 1692
                  which condemned 20 persons to death, was none other than <name type="pname">Samuel Sewall</name> (1653-1730), <name type="pname">Hull</name>'s

               <p>When first organized in 1652, the purpose of the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> mint was to supply silver coins of sterling fineness
                  for local commerce since even at that early time "uncertain" money was finding its way into the colony. The new silver pieces were reminted
                  from Spanish coins obtained from the West Indian trade. To ensure that this "Pine Tree" money, generically speaking, remain truly local and
                  not be exported, it was undervalued at 72 grains of sterling to the shilling which did not include an additional mint cost equivalent to
                  another 5.4 grains. Neither this reduced value nor stiff penalties imposed for exporting the money out of the area prevented the <name
                     type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver from circulating widely. Although the mint costs were eventually reduced, the population were
                  still not persuaded to take their money there to be reissued as "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name>" money. Despite some vague suggestions to
                  revitalize the mint, it was closed in 1682 for what appears to be a combination of economic and political reasons.</p>

                  <p>5.833 shillings per eight reales = 5s. 10d. less expense of 5.25d. = 5s. 4d. 3f. per eight reales when reminted as <name type="place"

                     <name type="pname">Sumner</name> stated that an eight reales "fresh from the mint was 420 grains [and] assumed to be of sterling alloy."
                     His calculations disregarded that the legal Spanish-American silver standard until 1728 was .9305 fine and not sterling quality of .925
                     fine. Since the Spanish silver would have been assayed and then adjusted prior to minting, either the colonist, taking his money to the
                     mint for reissuance as <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver, or the mintmaster could have gained a little in the process. If the
                     Spanish silver were of greater alloy than sterling, then there could have been a loss.</p>

                  <p>By establishment of the weight criterion, the problem of underweight eight reales, which typically varied anywhere from 12 to 15 dwt, was
                     satisfactorily circumvented. This legislation failed to recognize that individual coins could be of unequal fineness, either greater or
                     lesser than sterling alloy, and also disregarded the fact that the additional fees imposed by the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> mint

                  <name type="place">MARYLAND</name> SILVER COINAGE</head>
               <p>Encouraged by the example of his northern neighbors, <name type="place">Cecil Calvert</name>, <name type="place">Lord Baltimore</name>, had a
                  silver coinage of shillings, sixpence, and groats, minted in <name type="place">England</name> for use in <name type="place">Maryland</name>
                  some time before October 1659.<ref target="#CH3-n82">82</ref> This money bore the bust of <name type="place">Lord Baltimore</name> on the
                  obverse facing left and on the reverse a crowned lozenged shield with the Latin legends, "Cecil Lord of <name type="place">Maryland</name>,"
                  and "Increase and be Multiplied." Although the weight of <name type="place">Maryland</name> silver was 75% of the English, or 69.82 grains for
                  the shilling, it was of sterling alloy.</p>
               <p>The <name type="place">Maryland</name> charter of 1632 did not specifically permit the coinage of money, but the second <name type="place"
                     >Lord Baltimore</name> assumed this right. An action was initiated against his lordship by <name type="pname">Richard Pight</name>, Clerk
                  of the Irons of the Tower Mint, which caused <name type="place">Calvert</name> to be arrested as a "false coiner" by an order of October 4,
                  1659, and summoned to appear before the Privy Council. The indictment charged "that Cecill <name type="place">Lord Baltimore</name> and
                  diverse others with him, and for him, have made and transported great Sums of mony and doe still goe on to make more." The warrant commanded
                  the seizure of <name type="place">Lord Baltimore</name> and his colleagues together with their coins, coining "stamps, tooles, &amp;
                  Instruments." The following day. <name type="place">Lord Baltimore</name> appeared before the Council where it was learned "that a great
                  quantity of Silver is coyned into peeces of diverse rates &amp; values, and sent into <name type="place">Maryland</name> by the <name
                     type="place">Lo. Baltimore</name> or his Order." His lordship was ordered to attend a meeting of the Committee of the Council for the
                  Plantations who were given the responsibility to investigate and report "the whole business."<ref target="#CH3-n83">83</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There are several reasons why <name type="place">Lord Baltimore</name>'s coinage provoked official displeasure. As noted in the Privy Council
                  minutes, his lordship was exporting specie out of the realm which was <pb n="91"/> against the law. In 1658 and 1659, <name type="place"
                     >England</name> was approaching insolvency which would have prompted authorities to plug any drain of hard money from the country.<ref
                     target="#CH3-n84">84</ref> Secondly, the coined money "of diverse rates &amp; values" did not conform to the standards of the Tower Mint.
                  While <name type="place">Maryland</name> silver was sterling in quality, the weight fell short of Tower Mint issues. The fact that <name
                     type="place">Lord Baltimore</name> assumed the royal prerogative of coinage and even dared place his bust on the money would have been less
                  offensive to the Privy Council, since these events occurred during the interregnum of the Commonwealth when there was no reigning monarch.
                  Apparently a compromise must have been reached between <name type="place">Calvert</name> and the Privy Council since there is no record of any
                  disciplinary action and his coinage continued to circulate.</p>

               <p>The total coinage placed in circulation was in the vicinity of ¬£2,500. This is implied from a <name type="place">Maryland</name> law of April
                  12, 1662, requiring every "Householder and Freeman in the Province" to exchange 60 pounds of tobacco for ten shillings of the new silver
                     money.<ref target="#CH3-n85">85</ref> Although colonial records indicate that a mint was authorized in 1661, there is little doubt that all
                  this coinage is of English origin. The few copper pennies known to exist were probably patterns, never produced in significant numbers.</p>

                  <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place">Maryland</name> silver coinages share some common features. Both were
                  currencies created for the want of a domestic, circulating medium, having originated without any precise legal authority during the period of
                  the Commonwealth. A major difference was that <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> money was locally minted over the span of many years from
                  clipped, worn Spanish silver, while <name type="place">Maryland</name> money was minted by contract for a few months in <name type="place"
                     >England</name>.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">England</name> had "refused to allow separate colonial mints on the grounds that all the money of the Empire should conform
                  to one single standard,"<ref target="#CH3-n86">86</ref> but such conformity was an unacceptable alternative for the colonists since it would
                  devastate creditor-debtor relationships. In both colonies, their respective monies were of sterling alloy but significantly lighter than their
                  Tower Mint counterparts. The reduced weights of the colonial monies were necessary because of the inherent inequities between colonial and
                  metropolitan exchange rates and monies of account. Had the colonial and Tower shillings been of equal weight, then the bullion price for the
                     <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place">Maryland</name> issues would have far exceeded their commercial value of
                  12d., thus ensuring a immediate trip to the melting pot and subsequent export.</p>
               <p>Unlike <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> money, there are no existing records to indicate that <name type="place">Maryland</name> silver
                  ever circulated outside the province. In a manner similar to <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, <name type="place">Maryland</name> also
                     <pb n="92"/> forbade the export of foreign specie coins, including <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver, outside their colony,
                  except for the payment of "protested Bills of Exchange."<ref target="#CH3-n87">87</ref> These currency regulations, designed to keep
                  circulating gold and silver at home and to "cry up" its value, together with the issuance of domestic coinages, were similar actions by both
                     <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place">Maryland</name> to provide and maintain an adequate store of money for local
                  use.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">CHAPTER FOUR</hi>
               <lb/> Colonial Paper Currency</head>
            <p>In spite of <name type="place">England</name>'s mercantilist policies and the repressive actions of the Board of Trade, the North American
               economy grew and prospered. Even though the colonists complained loudly and frequently that they did not possess all the specie they thought
               necessary, and small denominational coins were subject to cyclical shortages at best, domestic and foreign commerce did proceed through the use
               of alternatives to hard coin or by the manipulation of exchange rates. The final method to be described for the expansion of the domestic money
               supply was the employment of four varieties of paper currencies: (a) commodity notes against warehoused goods; (b) bills of exchange; (c) bills
               of credit based on anticipated tax revenues; and (d) bills of credit, or land bank notes, issued by public loan offices. The first alternative
               was quasi-public in scope, the second was a more private or individual contract, whereas the latter two options were public in that the notes
               were issued by governmental authorities or private institutions. As previously stated, all of these schemes to augment the currency supply were
               not mutually exclusive, but while they were introduced successively, several operated simultaneously since one plan was not abandoned before
               another system was initiated. This chapter will summarize the introduction, use, and refinement of these several genera of paper currency.<ref

               <p>"Store house" or "commodity notes," were issued as receipts when marketable goods were consigned to official warehouses. Tobacco notes of
                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>, <name type="place">Maryland</name>, and the <name type="place">Carolinas</name> typify these warehouse
                  receipts which circulated as money among the merchant class and were more convenient to handle than the commodities themselves. These notes
                  were secured by the market value of the goods against which they were issued, but because of the potential for deterioration of tobacco, such
                  notes had an eighteen months' restriction as a circulating medium.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Newman</name> makes the interesting observation that the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> currency issue of July 11,
                  1771, was actually emitted to fund the colony's obligation for some of its tobacco warehouse receipts given for stored tobacco which was
                  subsequently destroyed when a public warehouse was flooded.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> This use of warehouse receipts was described by <name
                     type="pname">Benjamin Franklin</name> as follows: <q>The Usages [i.e. customary transactions agreeable to all parties] in Buying and

                     stored tobacco and these certificates circulated as currency. When the stored tobacco was lost in floods, the colony was obliged to raise
                     money to compensate the holders of receipts for the damaged commodity. The note pictured is a counterfeit (<name type="pname"

               <p>Warehouse receipts, or tobacco notes, were usually issued for a minimum of 950 lbs. of tobacco making the payment of a small debt very
                  inconvenient with this medium. In earlier days, small parcels of tobacco were carried about making it "incredible that such bulky material was
                  actually lugged into the courthouse to pay taxes and fees ...." Later there developed "transfer" tobacco notes to accomodate these smaller
                  consignments of tobacco deposited with officials, and as such, the receipts for these smaller portions became a kind of circulating medium.

               <p>The negotiable "bill of exchange" was another form of individual, or private, paper currency which saw limited circulation among colonial
                  merchants and was the chief payment method of foreign debts for imported goods.<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref> "The bill of exchange, basically
                  a negotiable instrument for the transfer of money, became a form of money itself when it circulated for a while before being presented for
                     payment."<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref> Such a bill was created when a colonial merchant purchased a draft from a second party who had
                  foreign credit and through this vehicle the merchant could pay for his goods in the foreign market. In its simplest form, a <name type="place"
                     >Boston</name> merchant contracts to buy cloth from a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> dealer. The merchant has the option of remitting the
                  agreed price to his supplier in specie via the next sailing ship. The more common practice is for him to negotiate with another <name
                     type="place">Boston</name> firm who regularly exports dried cod fish to <name type="place">England</name> and through the sale of this <pb

               <p>An appreciation of the problems colonial merchants encountered in paying for imported merchandise helps in understanding the intricacies of
                  colonial finance and commerce and the maneuvers undertaken to increase the pool of domestic currency. The colonial merchant, without a
                  personal source of credit but desiring English imports, had to buy English pounds sterling to pay for such goods and those pounds were
                  purchased with colonial monies of account. The price he had to pay for the real English money, in terms of his local money of account or
                  imaginary money, was determined by the prevailing commercial exchange rate. The financial instrument, through which such transactions were
                  usually conducted, was the bill of exchange or draft, bought in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>, payable in <name type="place"
                     >England</name>, and drawn on an account which had sterling credit. Such instruments were "commonly drawn at 30 Days' Sight," meaning that
                  they were payable 30 days after presentation.<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref> The rate of exchange, which determined the price of the English
                  credit purchased in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>, was a reflection of local short run economic factors, the trade deficit, the strength
                  of the local currency, and conditions of war, to name a few.<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref>
               </p>
               <p>To return to the example of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> merchant and his consignment of English cloth, if he had ordered this
                  material in August 1695, he would have had to pay his cod fish exporter friend <pb n="96"/> for the bill of exchange ¬£130 in <name
                     type="place">Massachusetts</name> money for every ¬£100 of English sterling credit he required, not including any additional amounts for
                  fees and expenses. Examples of the actual calculations involved in figuring the cost of such transactions are presented in Appendix 1. If the
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> merchant bought the same bolts of cloth 30 years later, the price in <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> money of account would have risen to ¬£300! This was the time that commodity monies were reintroduced into <name
                     type="place">Massachusetts</name> due to an economic downturn and shortage of available specie.<ref target="#CH4-n12">12</ref> The worst
                  was yet to come when in July 1747, during the depression following <name type="pname">King George</name>'s War, the rate had advanced to
                     ¬£1050!<ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Thomas Hancock</name> wrote of the postwar deflation in 1748, "Peace has put a stop to all our trade."<ref
                     target="#CH4-n14">14</ref> Indeed, international commerce cooled for <name type="place">New England</name> after hostilities ceased and
                  earned foreign credits were very scarce since the export trade was sluggish and anyone who wanted to buy a bill of exchange on <name
                     type="place">London</name> had to be prepared to pay handsomely for it. Hard money supplies dried up, or better stated, the purchase of
                  foreign credits for needed imports became exorbitantly expensive and people were reluctant to part with their coin. As the depression
                  deepened, few <name type="place">New England</name> merchants would risk spending scarce money on foreign purchases which they would have had
                  little likelihood of selling now that imported goods, more expensive than ever, piled up on their shelves as domestic money supplies became
                  tighter. During this period, commerce was lethargic in <name type="place">New England</name>, but for the other colonies the cost of foreign
                  credit remained stable although inflated in the <name type="place">Carolinas</name>. Relief was in sight for <name type="place">New
                     England</name>, when in 1749, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> received a large shipment of specie from <name type="place"
                     >England</name>. Such an account, as this hypothetical example of our <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> cloth merchant, demonstrates the
                  interaction between the prevaling local, or worldwide, economic climate, the health of the import-export trade, the availability or scarcity
                  of specie, the expense of foreign credits, the requirements for other hard money substitutes, and, of course, the inevitable complaints about
                  all of the above.</p>
               <p>The diverse economic conditions prevailing within the thirteen colonies created varying strengths of the local monies of account. For that
                  reason different exchange rates existed between the various colonies and <name type="place">England</name>, and among the colonies themselves.
                  This inequality within the colonial monies was a frustration which made intercolonial commerce confusing and complicated. If exports were low
                  and foreign credits, therefore, scarce, then the price for the bills of exchange increased to meet the demand.<ref target="#CH4-n15">15</ref>
                  Not all colonies had a flourishing export trade from which to derive sterling credit. This factor was a frustration to <name type="pname"
                     >Thomas Hancock</name> who noted that <name type="place">New England</name>, unlike the tobacco producing south, produced few commodities
                  for which there was any great demand in <name type="place">England</name>. As he wrote, "our Country Produce being so Low in <name
                     type="place">London</name> makes it Difficult to get money there."<ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref> As a resourceful merchant, <name
                     type="pname">Hancock</name> soon turned to whale oil and related products for which there was an active overseas market and a ready supply
                  of sterling credit.</p>
               <p>At such a time when the commercial exchange rate was unfavorable, the merchant might find it economically more advantageous to ship hard coin
                  to <name type="place">England</name> to meet his obligations rather than to pay the premium for the scarce sterling credits earned by sluggish
                  colonial exports. The level at which it was cheaper to pay by sending coin rather than buying expensive credits was called the "specie export
                     point."<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref> The colonial merchant was assisted in this decision whether to ship coin <pb n="97"/> or buy bills
                  of exchange by consulting published reference tables. When colonial exports were low and earned credit became expensive, more specie was
                  drained away to <name type="place">England</name> where it was remitted for imported goods as the "specie export point" was exceeded; thus the
                  supply of circulating coin dwindled in the colonies. The adequacy of the local hard money supply was, therefore, related to the strength of
                  the colonial export market. This is one explanation for the variable reports concerning the availability of coin in different areas at
                  different times, and why exchange rates, or the price of credit, differed among the colonies.</p>

               <head>BILLS OF CREDIT</head>
               <p>Previous chapters have described colonial monetary practices to augment domestic circulating currencies. These actions occurred against the
                  background of English mercantilism whose stated objectives were to keep the colonies dependent, yet wealthy enough to buy English goods but
                  not so prosperous as to develop competitive local industry. Initially the individual colonies became competitive in attracting specie into
                  their own territories, or discouraging drain, so that the local "crying up" of money or overvaluation of silver became a popular option. The
                  advantage of this currency manipulation was lost after the early 1700s when such practices became the target of the Proclamation of 1704.
                     <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> minted its own overvalued local coinage (in terms of sterling) and unsuccessfully forbade its
                  export in order to maintain enough circulating medium for domestic commerce. <name type="place">Maryland</name> imported a silver currency. By
                  the early eighteenth century, the American colonies were still faced with the situation of insufficient available specie to conduct commerce,
                  to underwrite military campaigns and to finance domestic projects. More inflationary programs were envisioned, the most significant of which
                  was the emergence of colonial paper currency or bills of credit.</p>
               <p>"If coin shortage was the underlying cause, war provided the immediate occasion for paper money."<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref> A series of
                  wars was fought in <name type="place">North America</name> between the French and English from 1689 to 1763, which, with the exception of the
                  French and Indian War, were local extensions of European conflicts.<ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref> In 1690 an ill-fated military expedition to
                  French <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> failed to return the anticipated booty to the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> treasury so that
                  the colony was unable to raise funds to pay troops and other war incurred obligations. The colonial government could not afford to borrow to
                  meet these expenses and their only recourse was to issue "bills of credit," backed only by the good faith of the colony in the expectation of
                  redemption funded by taxes. The fact was that hard money was available, but at what price? The statement of <name type="pname">Judge Samuel
                     Sewall</name> quoted in Chapter One is to be recalled again. "I was at making of the first Bills of Credit in the year 1690: They were not
                  made for want of Money; but for want of Money in the Treasury."</p>
               <p>The system under which these bills of credit were authorized is described as "currency finance." This is a stratagem whereby "the heavy burden
                  of military expenses and other public demands" is underwritten by "short-term lending by issuing notes in anticipation of future
                     tax-returns."<ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref>
                  <pb n="98"/> While this first emission of money solved the immediate problem of quelling mutinous soldiers who demanded their wages, it
                  launched the colonies on a hundred years' career of paper currency. A similar campaign in 1702 was responsible for additional paper money in
                     <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, and within the next year <name type="place">South Carolina</name> followed suit to support its
                  military objectives in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</name>. By 1710, further armed excursions into French <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and
                  the immediate need for ready cash lured the other <name type="place">New England</name> colonies, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, and
                     <name type="place">New Jersey</name> to solve their financial deficits with a printing press.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref> In 1712, <name
                     type="place">North Carolina</name> authorized paper money to defray the expense of war against the Tuscarora Indians. Typically the bills
                  of credit issued by these eight colonies in anticipation of tax revenues were interest bearing, had legal tender status, were receivable for
                  taxes, and contained specific provisions for their redemption.<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref>

               <head>LAND-BANK NOTES</head>
               <p>In addition to the bills of credit issued as fiat money and secured by future tax assessments for immediate government expenses such as war, a
                  second system of "currency finance" depended on paper money emitted by authorized colonial "land banks" or public "loan-offices."<ref
                     target="#CH4-n23">23</ref> In this format, a public loan office chartered by the colonial legislature provided low interest loans by
                  issuing bills of credit to qualified individuals who mortgaged their property as security. The land bank system has been described as: <q>the
                     primary social legislation of colonial <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. It was a method of putting currency into circulation and at the
                     same time affording loans to farmers which they could scarcely obtain from other sources.... As the annual installments due on the
                     principal came back into the loan office, the bills were cancelled and retired, though they were often reissued, or successive banks
                     established to maintain a continuous flow of loans. The colonies thus developed a medium of exchange out of "solid or real property ...
                     melted down and made to circulate in paper money or bills of credit."<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The land bank system, introduced in <name type="place">Barbados</name> in 1706,<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref> functioned on the assumption
                  that mortgaged real estate and silver plate would maintain the value of the paper currency and that the additional available money would
                  stimulate the economy. In 1712, <name type="place">South Carolina</name> was the first mainland colony to set up a public loan office, and by
                  1755, all colonies except <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> participated in this type of currency venture.<ref target="#CH4-n26">26</ref> The

                  since their money achieved stability and depreciated little.<ref target="#CH4-n27">27</ref> The well-managed <name type="place"

                     target="#CH4-n28">28</ref> In <name type="place">New England</name> and the south, land banks did not fare as well. Paper currency had
                  depreciated in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> prior to 1750, the year when it was redeemed for specie. <name type="place">North
                     Carolina</name> continued with inflated paper money, whereas <name type="place">South Carolina</name> managed its currency well from 1731
                  until the Revolution. <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> had nine land bank emissions<ref target="#CH4-n29">29</ref> and flooded the <name
                     type="place">New England</name> area with large quantities of depreciated paper which "undermined the currency of her neighbors."<ref
                     target="#CH4-n30">30</ref> The abuses within her land bank system precipitated the Currency Act of 1751.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> did not issue paper money until 1755 when forced into that position by expenses of the French and Indian
                  War. Prior to that time, hard coin had been supplemented with tobacco notes. "The expansion of population, the conversion of a barter economy
                  into a rapidly growing market economy," periodic fluctuations in the tobacco market,<ref target="#CH4-n31">31</ref> and the shortage of
                  circulating specie,<ref target="#CH4-n32">32</ref> together with military expenses, pressed the colony to create a paper currency. The new
                  money, secured by anticipated tax revenues rather than a land bank,<ref target="#CH4-n33">33</ref> fared well until 1760 when falling tobacco
                  prices in the export market created a depression. Specie and bills of exchange then became so expensive that <name type="place"
                     >Virginia</name> currency was depreciated up to 60% for the purchase of expensive sterling credits.<ref target="#CH4-n34">34</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A unique paper currency circulated in the corporate Colony of <name type="place">Georgia</name> from 1735 to 1750. These "sola" bills were
                  printed, endorsed, bills of exchange, denominated in pounds sterling, and drawn in <name type="place">England</name> on behalf of the trustees
                  of the Colony. The money circulated at par in the Colony until returned to <name type="place">England</name> for redemption.<ref
                     target="#CH4-n35">35</ref> Hard money was very scarce in <name type="place">Georgia</name> since the colony had no provision for inflating
                  silver as did the other twelve (see Table 6). The typical practice for anyone in <name type="place">Georgia</name> possessing silver coin was
                  to buy inflated, yet stable <name type="place">South Carolina</name> paper money at an exchange of ¬£600 or ¬£700, <name type="place">South
                     Carolina</name> currency, to ¬£100, <name type="place">Georgia</name> currency. It was wiser to spend <name type="place">South

               <p>The study of colonial paper currency has been punctuated with much controversy. <name type="pname">Ernst</name> and <name type="pname"
                     >Ferguson</name> point out to modern day readers that some historians of the past century allowed their personal views on "sound money"
                  (paper backed by bullion) to bias their interpretation and commentaries on the colonial period especially in regard to the stability of
                  colonial currency and the purported conflict between the creditor and debtor classes.<ref target="#CH4-n38">38</ref> Historians of the last
                  century retrospectively blamed the depreciation of colonial paper money on low public confidence in fiat money unsecured in bullion, issued in
                  excess, and printed at the instigation of debtors to lessen the burden of their obligations. They further supported their position by quoting
                  such contemporary observers as <name type="pname">William Douglass</name>, an avowed foe of paper money, who was described by his biographer
                  as "a man of strong prejudices, always inclined to espouse one side of any question and unable to see the other...."<ref target="#CH4-n39"
                     >39</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Douglass</name>, a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> physician, leveled many tirades against <pb n="100"/> the paper money
                  practices of the 1700s with the typical denunciation that "paper money-making assemblies have been legislatures of debtors"<ref
                     target="#CH4-n40">40</ref> which encouraged its issue to reduce their own personal indebtedness "for [their] private iniquitous ends."<ref
                     target="#CH4-n41">41</ref> He further claimed that the overabundance of paper money caused its own depreciation, did not successfully
                  augment the "medium of trade" but on the contrary was responsible for an increased price of silver. Modern historians have refuted such
                  arguments and have emphasized that the conditions responsible for the depreciation of colonial currency, such as occurred in <name
                     type="place">Virginia</name> in the 1760s, were normal market forces and currency fluctuations, simple price inflation, and short-run
                  economic factors rather than the depreciation of large quantities of unsecured paper money which lacked public confidence.</p>
               <p>The assertion is made that it was the unrestricted profusion of colonial paper money that was responsible for its own depreciation. While the
                  "quantity theory" may be argued for the decline of paper money in <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> and other colonies during certain
                  periods, it would be an untrue generalization for all regions, despite the opinions of earlier writers. These earlier historians also
                  generalized that class conflicts existed between creditors and debtors, and merchants and farmers, where the creditors and merchants stood for
                  secure currency, such as hard coin, while the debtors and farmers lobbied for paper currency since they sought a depreciating medium with
                  which to satisfy their obligations.<ref target="#CH4-n42">42</ref> In fact, this inaccurate concept that opposing fiscal policies continued to
                  excite class-oriented animosity "is so widely and uncritically made ... that it is almost a cliche."<ref target="#CH4-n43">43</ref> This
                  alleged creditor-debtor and merchant-farmer class struggle was not broadly representative of conditions in all the colonies and this concept
                  is an inexact portrayal of colonial life, except in specific locations such as <name type="place">Rhode Island</name>. In general, colonial
                  paper money was a stable medium throughout its history.</p>
               <p>Financing colonial participation in the French and Indian Wars was largely a local responsibility. <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>
                  successfully persuaded the English Parliament to redeem the colonial bills of credit issued to offset the expense of the Cape Breton offensive
                  of 1715. A large shipment of 650,000 ounces of Spanish silver coins and ten tons of English coppers arrived in <name type="place"
                     >Boston</name> on the ship <hi rend="italic">

                  </hi> on September 18, 1749.<ref target="#CH4-n44">44</ref> These coppers are of numismatic importance since 801,376 halfpence and 424,032
                  farthings, mostly dated 1749, continued to circulate for years and should be considered an important and legitimate colonial coinage.<ref

               <p>The paper money policies of the mainland colonies came under the scrutiny and attack of English merchants and the Board of Trade which
                  proposed corrective legislation. Parliament was finally goaded into action when the <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> Assembly issued
                  ¬£50,000 loan office notes in a popular request for more depreciated currency. The reaction from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> was the
                  passage of the Currency Act of 1751 which regulated paper money in the <name type="place">New England</name> colonies by outlawing land banks,
                  forcing existing paper to be retired strictly according to the terms of its issue, and stating that any new paper could only be used to pay
                  the current expenses of government and must be redeemable by taxes. The final provision of this restrictive act was to deny the legal tender
                  status of paper currency for private debts.<ref target="#CH4-n49">49</ref>

               <p>There is substantial reason to conclude that the parliamentary restraints on colonial paper money which directly influenced commerce was a
                  significant factor in precipitating the Revolutionary War.<ref target="#CH4-n56">56</ref> Now that the French and Indian Wars had come to an
                  end, <name type="place">England</name> could direct closer attention to its colonies and its protective policies became more restrictive. This
                  increased scrutiny occurred at the time of a postwar depression when the wartime economy cooled after the termination of hostilities. The
                  regulation of colonial currency by the English at this time of economic upheaval only added to the local burden. Bankruptcies were commonplace
                  but a positive outcome was the stimulation and encouragement of local manufacturing. "Increasingly after the French and Indian War, the
                  colonial importer looked upon the development of domestic industry as an integral part of a program to achieve economic sovereignty to counter
                  the restrictions imposed by membership in the British Empire."<ref target="#CH4-n57">57</ref> As the years passed, the colonists became
                  increasingly vexed with English authority, and the antagonisms which arose eventually culminated in the War of Independence.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">CHAPTER FIVE</hi>
               <lb/> The Emergence of Copper Coinage</head>
            <p>The role of foreign specie in the currency of <name type="place">British North America</name> has been explored in previous chapters. Large
               denominational gold and silver coins, while never plentiful, could be obtained at a price for overseas transactions. In contrast, lower
               denominational foreign and domestic silver coins, the money of daily, domestic commerce, were usually scarce in the colonies. English farthings
               and halfpence, however, which formed the small change medium, were imported in great abundance. Since the history of copper money in the American
               colonial and Confederation periods is inextricably linked to the emergence of English and Irish base metal coinages, it is important to examine
               the development of the small change currency in <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, the subject of this
               chapter.</p>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e21152" type="section">
               <head>SMALL CHANGE IN <name type="place">ENGLAND</name>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">England</name> continued to experience significant domestic monetary problems during the colonial period and ignored the
                  coinage requirements of her New World colonies except perhaps for the impotent expression of concern presented in the Proclamation of 1704.
                  Her own specie was being drained to India and the Continent where it fetched higher prices. She was in no position to rescue her American
                  possessions from their monetary predicaments even if it had been her intent to do so. Laws were passed forbidding the exportation of English
                  silver and gold coin except when British currency was required to pay armed forces on foreign duty. This general export prohibition did not
                  apply to bullion, foreign coins, and English copper.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> The sorry state of <name type="place">England</name>'s
                  disordered currency was further intensified by the abundance of worn, clipped, lightweight coins, which, with few exceptions, were
                  hammer-struck until 1663. In February of that year, the mint finally adopted the technology of the screw press and milled, or reeded, edges
                  which, although developed fully a century earlier, had been blocked from introduction by the opposition of the organized moneyers.<ref
                     target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> To remedy the inequities in weight of the antiquated, clipped, hammered coins, a recoinage was ordered in 1696.
                  All old money was thereby demonetized and recalled to the mint where, under the supervision of <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Newton</name>, new
                  coins were reissued with a milled, i.e. reeded, or lettered edge.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> The newly designed rim discouraged clipping
                  since any alteration was easily detected. However, this innovation in manufacture did not protect newly minted coins from the melting pot and
                  subsequent exportation as bullion since the mint price of silver was frequently lower than the market price. The net result was a continued
                  shortage of English coined silver money.<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref>
               </p>
               <p>While the precious metals obviously had greater importance in trade and commerce, copper filled the need for small change and was the money of
                  the poor. In this chapter, the origins of the various copper token and regal coinages are traced from their beginnings in <name type="place"
                     >England</name> to their subsequent use in <name type="place">British North America</name>. Of great significance in the study of these
                  series is the <pb n="106"/> parallel circulation of both legitimate and counterfeit issues. It is important to understand the history of this
                  money, both legal and spurious, because of the direct relationship to the American copper coinages of the Confederation period.</p>
               <p>In <name type="place">England</name> from 780 until 1279, the only silver coinage had been the penny. At that time, the currency was expanded
                  under <name type="pname">Edward I</name> with the introduction of the silver farthing and halfpenny for small change and the larger four penny
                  groat. There existed the need for smaller coins but these could not be produced in sufficient numbers to satisfy the needs of commerce since
                  lower denominational coins were uneconomical to make because of their diminutive size; one farthing required sixteen times the labor and time
                  to mint as that expended on a silver penny. Another reason for their scarcity was that they were so tiny "they were liable to slip between the
                  stitching of purses, and when dropped, were only slightly easier to find than contact lenses."<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> Over the years the
                  buying power of these tiny coins declined as inflation developed and the silver coinage underwent periodic debasement. By the reign of <name
                     type="pname">Elizabeth</name> I, if a farthing were minted at .925 fine, the piece would have weighed a mere two grains! The queen rejected
                  proposals to make the lower denominational coins larger by using debased silver. Instead, the halfpenny became the smallest silver coin and
                  the monarch introduced a three-farthing piece so that one could make a farthing purchase with this new coin and receive a halfpenny in change
                  from the shopkeeper.<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Still there was not ample small change for commerce. "The Crown seems to have considered it beneath the royal dignity to issue coins struck in
                  base metal," and to supplement the short supply of silver small denominational currency, merchants resorted to local tradesmen's tokens.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> Accordingly, English merchants, as early as 1404, introduced their own halfpenny or farthing tokens, or "pledges,"
                  made of "lead, tin, latten, and even of leather." The inconvenience was that these "pledges" were only redeemable by the issuing tradesman.
                  Private lead tokens were very common through the reign of <name type="pname">Elizabeth I</name>. These tokens, later made of copper and
                  pewter, were an unofficial fiduciary coinage in that their metal content was worth far less than their denominational monetary value.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n8">8</ref>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_88905668">James I</name>, who ascended to the throne in 1603, outlawed these private tokens, having a different scheme to address the
                  small change crisis.</p>
               <p>By <name type="pname">King James</name>'s plan, the Royal Mint in 1613 began to strike copper farthings authorized by a royal patent granted
                  to <name type="pname">Lord Harington</name> with whom the king shared tremendous profits. These coppers "were ordered to pass equally current
                  in <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>."<ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> The tiny farthings were required
                  only to weigh six grains at a minimum, the early ones weighing only five grains, but later issues averaging nine. Initially they were tinned
                  to present the more valuable appearance of silver, but this veneer of respectability soon wore off. These issues were easily counterfeited at
                  great profit. The patent passed to the Duke of <name type="pname">Lennox</name>, and successively to the Duchess of <name type="place"
                     >Richmond</name> in 1624 and ten years later to <name type="pname">Lord Maltravers</name>. The farthing tokens were not well received
                  because of their lightweight and very low intrinsic value. To make matters worse, <name type="pname">Lord Maltravers</name> refused to honor
                  token farthings of the previous patentees, thus swindling the public, especially the poor, out of vast sums. His outward excuse was to
                  discredit the volume of counterfeit tokens that had appeared over the years. One denunciation against the patentees for their profiteering at
                  popular expense referred to them as "the very Caterpillers <pb n="107"/> of this Kingdome." Popular dissatisfaction with the tokens became
                  intense; in 1642 the <name type="place">Puritan</name> Parliament, which on principle denounced both monopolies and base coinage, ordered
                  production of the Maltravers farthings stopped.<ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref>

               <p>There is a colonial connection with the token farthings. The coinage was familiar to the <name type="place">Puritan</name> colonists of <name
                     type="place">Massachusetts</name> Bay who similarly disapproved and rejected them in favor of commodity money for small change. The General
                  Court was quicker to condemn this lightweight money than Parliament since the first legislation ever enacted in <name type="place"
                     >Boston</name> in reference to small currency was the demonetization of these tiny coins on March 4, 1635. "It is ordered that hereafter
                  farthings shall not passe for currant pay. It is likewise ordered, that muskett bulletts of a full boare shall passe currantly for a farthing

               <p>There were several important differences between copper coins and those of precious metals. First of all, copper was calculated in avoirdupois
                  at 7,000 grains to the pound, while gold and silver were measured by the troy system at 5,760 grains to the pound. A second important
                  distinction to be emphasized was that there was no export restriction for copper thus explaining how English halfpence and farthings could be
                  included in the Spanish specie shipment to <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> in 1749. The final and most significant point was that base
                  metal coins, i.e. copper, tin or brass, were never considered money <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> but only as a token substitute for money.
                  English officialdom looked upon copper coinage in a rather condescending manner while at the same time acknowledging its utility. Its
                  manufacture was not a regular duty of the mint but rather was a special arrangement between the king and the mintmaster.<ref target="#CH5-n17"
                     >17</ref> Although copper coins were made legal tender by a Proclamation of August 16, 1672, their minting costs were included in the
                  overall value of the coin and could not be waived because of "the disproportionately high cost of manufacturing copper coin, as compared with
                  gold and silver."<ref target="#CH5-n18">18</ref> The new coppers, therefore, passed at a rate greater than the intrinsic value of the metal.
                  To make matters more complicated, the mint actually produced the halfpence and farthings at a substantial profit to the Crown. This potential
                  for gain in the minting of coppers encouraged counterfeiting, "and so laid the seeds of much trouble for the future."<ref target="#CH5-n19"
                     >19</ref> The status of the small change medium is well described in an account written in 1757 by the king's assaymaster, <name
                     type="pname">Joseph Harris</name>. <q>Copper coin with us are properly not money, but a kind of tokens passing by way of exchange instead
                     of parts of the smallest pieces of silver coin; and as such, very useful in small home traffic... A silver penny is too small for common
                     use; and yet pence, and their halfs, and quarters enter daily into accounts. To supply the want of very small silver coins, a kind of
                     TOKENS or substitutes have been instituted; these are now with us, all made of copper, and of two species only, called half-pence, and
                     farthings; and these are a legal tender in all sums below sixpence .... But these base coins should never be thrust upon the public in too
                     great abundance; or be made to pass for more than the value of the copper, and the necessary expense of workmanship; otherwise they will be
                     counterfeited, notwithstanding any laws to the contrary.<ref target="#CH5-n20">20</ref>

               <p>From 1672 until 1679, finished copper planchets for the farthings and halfpence of <name type="pname">Charles II</name> were imported from
                     <name type="place">Sweden</name> where an export duty of 2 1/2d. per pound had been imposed. To circumvent this situation and to assist a
                  failing domestic industry, substitution of tin for copper was an alternative which had been proposed for years. An expanded market for tin
                  would bolster sagging tin prices, curry political favor from the <name type="place">Western England</name> parliamentary delegations, and
                  increase royal revenues. The tin mines of <name type="pname">Cornwall</name>, the property of the Crown, were leased out to operators or "tin
                  farmers." As far back as 1651, plans were discussed to exploit the stannaries for the royal advantage. In 1667, the tin farmers petitioned the
                  king for a tin coinage in the hope that an increased demand would support prices and protect them from financial ruin.<ref target="#CH5-n21"
                     >21</ref> The price for tin continued to decline and by 1676 would have fallen even further had not the Crown arranged to buy the output of
                  the mines at 8d. per pound.<ref target="#CH5-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>To promote Devonian, Cornish, and regal interests, the proposal was enacted that several Tower Mint commissioners would be granted a patent to
                  mint tin farthings during the last two years of the reign of <name type="pname">Charles II</name> in 1684 and 1685. During the times of <name

                  both farthings and halfpence were exclusively of tin. The edge inscription on these pieces, <hi rend="italic">NVMMORVM FAMVLVS</hi>, "The
                  Servant of Coinage," emphasized their token and fiduciary status. The entire tin coinage from March 1681 until January 1692 amounted to some
                  341 tons. At a cost for finished tin of only 8d. per pound as compared to 14 1/2d. for copper, the profit margin for the crown was substantial
                  as revealed in Table 10.<ref target="#CH5-n23">23</ref> The substitution of tin for copper was so lucrative that it encouraged large scale
                  counterfeiting. This illegal activity was thwarted to a degree since all genuine tin coins had a square plug of copper through their centers,
                  but in spite of this device to deter counterfeiting, a large quantity of cast lead forgeries was produced.<ref target="#CH5-n24">24</ref>

                  The tin experiment proved unpopular and was discontinued on April 17, 1694, based on the coins' low intrinsic value, the ease of
                  counterfeiting, and that they became "an obstruction to trade and a grievance to the subject[s]."<ref target="#CH5-n25">25</ref> The tin

                  be discovered. It is supposed that the Spanish denomination was selected because of colonial familiarity with Spanish money which would
                  facilitate acceptance in commerce. Holt's 1688 patent tin coinage lacked the copper plug incorporated into the regal tin coins to thwart
                  would-be counterfeiters. The American issues appear to have been lighter than the English and hence the profit to the patentee was greater
                  since production costs were otherwise equal. Not much is known of Holt's coinage except that <name type="pname">Newman</name> has identified
                  six pairs of dies. Restrikes made in 1828 from original dies were struck in a pewter-like metal whereas the original 1688 issues were pure

               <p>Production of copper farthings and halfpence was resumed at the royal mint in 1691 for just one year. After the death of <name type="pname"

                  the economy of casting the planchets rather than by rolling the copper and then cutting the blanks. Although this process was more profitable,
                  it resulted in inferior coins with pitted surfaces and poor definition since pure "copper does not ... cast with any degree of sharpness,
                  unless there is a slight admixture of some other metal, such as tin or zinc." The contractors not only produced their planchets by a cheaper
                  method, but they also employed less skilled engravers, who, while working for lower wages, committed numerous blunders in the legends. An
                  inverted "V" was frequently substituted for an "A." Complaints were received that some of these coppers were light in weight, sometimes as low
                  as 52 to 56 per pound rather than the required 42. Protests about the quality of this coinage were so frequently received that Parliament

               <p>By this time, counterfeit copper coins were starting to become a problem, a situation that the Mint commonly regarded as a symptom of
                     shortage;<ref target="#CH5-n40">40</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Newton</name> disagreed, contending that the small change supply was still ample. In 1713 he estimated that the copper
                  change requirement for all <name type="place">England</name> would not exceed 600 long tons of which there were about 500 "already
                     current."<ref target="#CH5-n41">41</ref> The regular minting of coppers did not resume again at the Royal Mint until 1717 during the reign
                  of <name type="pname">George I</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n42">42</ref>
               </p>
               <p>From this point, all copper coinage was to be manufactured at the Tower Mint when previously the planchets had either been purchased from
                     <name type="place">Sweden</name> or provided by private contractors. Since <name type="pname">Newton</name> insisted on pure copper, it was
                  no longer permissible to add minute quantities of tin, even under 0.25%, to facilitate casting or rolling. To develop a practical method for
                  the determination of pure copper, <name type="pname">Newton</name> adopted an assay based on the physical characteristics of the metal. When
                  heated to a red hot glow, only pure copper resisted cracking when beaten with a sledge hammer. If copper were cheapened by adulteration with
                  any tin or zinc, it would become brittle and break or crack when subjected to this test.<ref target="#CH5-n43">43</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Newton</name> further advised that annual coinages not exceed 40 long tons lest his demand for the copper affect the market
                     price.<ref target="#CH5-n44">44</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Copper coinage was relatively continuous from 1717 until 1751 when there was a hiatus until 1770. It is of interest to examine the cost of
                  production of English coppers at the Royal Mint. As previously noted, not only the cost of the copper, but all labor, fees, and planchet
                  preparation expenses were figured into the value of the copper coins (see Table 10), whereas such costs for silver and gold were absorbed by
                  the government as a legitimate charge.<ref target="#CH5-n45">45</ref> In that these coppers were a token coinage which represented money
                  rather than being of full money value themselves, any manipulation that either decreased production costs or increased yield per pound of
                  metal, augmented the profit margin to the Crown or the patentee. The windfall experienced upon changing to tin from 1684 to 1692 has already

                  <p>English copper was not restricted from colonial use and was the principal minor coinage in <name type="place">Britain</name>'s American

                     1695 to 1775 which approximated 17.5% of the total copper minted.<ref target="#CH5-n48">48</ref> The first large shipment of ¬£300 was sent

                     it would in <name type="place">England</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n50">50</ref> Ten long tons of coppers were consigned to <name type="place"
                        >Massachusetts</name> in 1749 as part of the settlement from Parliament for the colony's participation in the Cape Breton offensive.
                     This amounted to ¬£2,111 4s. 8d. which was divided among 801,376 halfpence and 424,032 farthings. The majority were dated 1749 and comprised
                     about 23% of the Royal Mint's copper production for that year. By 1770, most colonies had published exchange rates for the regal English
                     halfpence which were the prevalent small change of the plantations. These rates are enumerated in Table 11 but there is no differential for
                     the heavier copper coins of 1672 to 1701. The exchange ratios for English halfpence (Table 11) held well for royal coppers of consistent
                     weight until 1787. Circumstances were significantly altered when debased, lightweight, and counterfeit coins were introduced into commerce
                     and public confidence in the circulating token copper coinage weakened. As it was, the intrinsic metallic value of English coppers was
                     approximately 50% of monetary value, therefore, public acceptance was delicate at best for this token coinage.</p>

                  <p>Since token regal coinage was minted at a substantial profit above the legitimately incurred costs and fees as described in Table 10,
                     counterfeiting of copper and tin was invited and became <pb n="115"/> a prevalent social evil just as <name type="pname">Harris</name>
                     predicted. The extensive <name type="pname">Batty</name> collection catalogued many contemporary counterfeit issues which were coined in
                        <name type="place">England</name> and it is obvious that this false money rapidly found its way into the New World. As early as 1698,
                     reports circulated from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> of "large numbers of lead and pewter farthings and halfpence" with the
                     warning "that they should be 'wholly suppressed' because of the damage they can do ... 'only those of Copper which are the <name
                        type="pname">King</name>'s Coyn may pass the farthings for two a penny the half pence for a penny'."<ref target="#CH5-n51">51</ref> In
                        <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, in 1700, counterfeit money of "brass and Tin" was the subject of a legislative action which
                     punished any persons who "shall presume to make or Stamp any such peices [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] ... and to Emit, utter, or put off

                        >53</ref> a reasonable conclusion is that some of these counterfeits represented cast tin farthings of <name type="pname">Charles

                  <p>A great cache of cast counterfeit <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_100194418">William III</name> halfpence, dated 1699, was uncovered during a highway excavation in
                        <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> in 1975.<ref target="#CH5-n55">55</ref> Such sand cast counterfeit halfpence of <name
                        type="pname">William III</name> began to appear in <name type="place">England</name> around 1725 when genuine coins were melted down and
                     cast into lightweight counterfeits. The apparent motive here, in order to avoid suspicion, was to manufacture coins of a prior monarch
                     since it would be anticipated that a 25 year old coin would appear worn and imperfect. People expected coppers of that period to be flawed
                     anyway since so many were struck on roughly cast planchets.<ref target="#CH5-n56">56</ref> This is doubtless the origin of the coins in the
                        <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> highway find. It has been postulated that this hoard of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_100194418">William III</name>
                     counterfeits was imported prior to 1735 at a time when the exchange rate in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> was legally set at 12
                     halfpence to the local shilling although considering strict adherence to the exchange rates it should have been 14. 4d. This was a 2.4d.
                     overvaluation per <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> shilling for coppers, thereby securing a 20% profit for anyone who imported
                     halfpence. The overvaluation of halfpence enticed both genuine and counterfeit coppers into the region, creating an over-abundance. The
                     surplus of small money led in turn to public unrest when merchants objected to the established rate of twelve to the shilling. Some minor
                     riots ensued in 1741 when certain tradesmen insisted on taking 15 halfpence to a <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> shilling. "The
                     bakers refused to bake bread and the mob broke windows in many shops." The halfpence were subsequently revalued to 15 to the <name

                     counterfeits were rife and now their authors were becoming more brazen as they actually struck current bogus halfpence from dies in a

                     in 1751 that "every town and village had its mint."<ref target="#CH5-n60">60</ref> These illegal issues, added to the ¬£173,000 coined since

                     combined regal and counterfeit coins created an absolute overabundance of copper currency which was accumulating with merchants who could
                     not pass it along. The halfpence were so numerous that they had practically displaced gold and silver in commerce. Some claimed, in a 1754
                     petition to the king, that they were saddled with ¬£50 to ¬£500 of unnegotiable halfpence which were not legal tender for taxes, would not be
                     received in purchase of a bill of exchange, and could only be spent for small purchases. Many employers used this money to pay their
                     workers. The Mint rejected as impractical the suggestions either to withdraw all coppers and start over, or to devalue existing ones to
                     remove the profit motive for counterfeiters.<ref target="#CH5-n61">61</ref>

                  <p>This continued influx of base metal coppers into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> resulted in grievances among the merchants, economic
                     losses in commerce, and eroded public trust in the medium. Responding to this situation, the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> legislature
                     on December 12, 1753, imposed a ¬£100 fine on anyone convicted of importing counterfeit coppers and a penalty of ten times the value of any
                     false coins passed. Because of market pressures, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> merchants had generally agreed to accept only 14
                     coppers to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling, in stead of 12. Based on the established value of the Spanish American eight
                     reales, the genuine regal halfpenny was overvalued in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in 1750 at 12 to the colonial shilling. This
                     differential, unfavorable to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, had created a flow of coppers into that colony from adjacent <name
                        type="place">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> where the rate of exchange for halfpence, in comparison to
                     the Spanish standard, was more accurately reflected.<ref target="#CH5-n67">67</ref> To curb this stream of coppers into the colony where
                     they were overvalued and had more purchasing power. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in 1753 devalued the halfpence and established an
                     equilibrium in the movement of English halfpence from its neighboring plantations. This was accomplished by increasing the exchange ratio
                     to 14 coppers per colonial shilling, without discrimination as to the weight of the copper, a rate already set by the local merchants and
                     now confirmed by law.<ref target="#CH5-n68">68</ref> The rate is summarized in Table 12. (See also Appendix 1.)</p>
                  <p>The readjustment of the value of coppers in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> was not without conflict; an incident was reported where
                     three arrests resulted when individuals encouraged a mob to riot by throwing coppers among them. In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>,
                     the abundance of false coppers had so diluted and debased the circulating currency that there was some discussion of a further increase of
                     the exchange rate from 15 to 18 coppers per colonial shilling, the prior adjustment having been made in 1741. There was an orderly
                     depreciation of the copper medium first in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> and 12 years later in <name type="place">New
                        York</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n69">69</ref> Despite expansion of the copper currency with a plethora of English counterfeits, the medium
                     continued to sustain public confidence. Apparently the 1753 <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> rate increase to 14 coppers per shilling,
                     the crackdown on imports of illegal coppers, and the heightened general awareness of spurious coins, restored public confidence in coppers
                     so that the exchange relationships outlined in Table 11 remained quite stable up through the Confederation period until 1787 when
                     significant troubles developed. The equilibrium in the intra and intercolonial circulation of currency, in this case copper, was driven by
                     local market pressures fired by exchange rates and the size of the money supply.</p>

                  <p>In <name type="place">England</name>, petitions to the king in complaint against this avalanche of false money were responsible for the

                     <name type="pname">Feavearyear</name> described the situation: <q>Thus by the last quarter of the eighteenth century the copper money was
                        getting into as bad a condition as the silver, and no one seems to have been able to make satisfactory proposals for dealing with
                        either. There was a shortage of silver coins because the Mint made them too heavy. There was an excess of copper ones because the Mint
                        made them too light. So long as it lay beyond the administrative capacity of government to put down counterfeiting, the remedy for the
                        position clearly lay in making copper coins much heavier and the silver ones a trifle lighter.... Public opinion was strongly in favour
                        of raising the weight of the copper coins so that they should contain their full value of metal, but there was no willingness as yet to
                        see the silver coins degraded to mere tokens.<ref target="#CH5-n72">72</ref>

                     total of 248 different counterfeits for that year. For 1773 and 1774, when there were but ten and seven legitimate die pairs, the <name
                        type="pname">Batty</name> Collection catalogued 93 and 87 different coppers with those dates, respectively, the difference being due to
                     the large number of spurious issues. Earlier counterfeit halfpence dated 1770, 1771, and 1772 are much less frequently seen although the
                        <name type="pname">Batty</name> Collection contained some 18, 44, and 12 varieties, respectively for those years. All counterfeit
                     farthings of <name type="pname">George III</name> are quite rare, whereas even today, counterfeit halfpence with his effigy are still
                     encountered in old accumulations and dealers' "junk boxes." As with the <name type="pname">Batty</name> experience, 1775-dated counterfeit
                     halfpence are found to be about three times more common than each of the 1774 and 1773 issues, the earlier years being definitely scarcer
                     in comparison. These counterfeit <name type="pname">George III</name> coppers, especially the halfpence, were exported to the colonies in
                     vast numbers where they comprised the bulk of the small change medium into the early Federal period.</p>
                  <p>Considering that counterfeit coppers were so commonplace within the fabric of the English monetary system where they circulated, both at
                     home and abroad, without significant challenge, it is not at all surprising to learn that ambitious colonists also began to engage in
                     counterfeiting practices. The most famous domestic manufacturer of the so-called imitation English halfpence is believed to have been <name
                        type="pname">Captain Thomas Machin</name> from <name type="place">Newburgh</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>. Specimens
                     attributed <pb n="121"/> to this source share some dates with legal issues (1747, 1771, 1772, 1774, and 1775) but there are many positively
                     fictitious varieties dated 1776, 1777, 1778, 1787, and 1788, since no legal issues exist for those dates. The imitation halfpence from
                        <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> are easily identified by their characteristic figures and lettering, and when punch linked to
                     other colonial coppers thought to be from that mint, their source is easily traced. The details of this <name type="place">Newburgh</name>
                     mint are contained in a subsequent chapter.</p>
                  <p>Another counterfeiting operation has been placed in the village of <name type="place">Barneyville</name> in the township of <name
                        type="place">Swansea</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>. The community, also known as <name type="place">Bungtown</name>,
                     was the site of the <name type="pname">Barney</name> family shipbuilders who "are said to have cast, in sand-moulds, fac-similes of the
                     English Halfpennies of that period and circulated them as Cents; to these clumsy products the name of <name type="place">Bungtowns</name>
                     was given, from the popular name of the village where the <name type="pname">Barneys</name> lived."<ref target="#CH5-n75">75</ref> This
                     location has been proposed as the origin of a 1784-dated copper designated <name type="pname">Vlack</name> 14-84 A, but those specimens are
                     not sand cast from a contemporary issue but rather struck from crude dies on inferior planchets.<ref target="#CH5-n76">76</ref> If the
                     statement is accurate that the "<name type="place">Barneyville</name> mint" sand casted copies of current English coppers, then one would
                     expect their product to have been rough cast copies of legal halfpence. This hypothesis is supported by a 1786 account which details the
                     conviction of a local resident for passing "mixed metal" counterfeit British halfpence in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name>. Since the sand
                     casting technique would leave no identifying features as to manufacturer, such coins would be difficult to trace. While the unrefined
                     appearance of the 1784 halfpence points to an American source rather than English, its mint of origin remains a mystery. Another domestic
                     counterfeit English halfpenny dated 1786, listed by <name type="pname">Vlack</name>, has no characteristics in common with the above
                     mentioned 1784 or other <name type="place">Newburgh</name> issues and is obviously from another clandestine mint. The American provenance
                     of this copper is irrefutable since it shares a common reverse with a counterfeit <name type="place">Connecticut</name> copper, <name
                        type="pname">Miller</name> 1786 2.4-U.<ref target="#CH5-n77">77</ref>

                  <p>
                     <name type="pname">Batty</name> catalogued other copper halfpence of <name type="pname">George III</name> with purely imaginative dates
                     which included two varieties for 1766, eight for 1776, four varieties each for 1777 and 1781, and one variety for 1794. Also in his
                     collection of fictitious dates were a 1787 <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> copper (<name type="pname">Vlack</name> 17-87B) and the
                     1784 (<name type="pname">Vlack</name> 14-84A) just described. It is anyone's guess how these colonial counterfeits found their way to <name
                        type="place">England</name>. Additionally, four die combinations of 1785 counterfeit <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence have
                     been researched by <name type="pname">Newman</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n78">78</ref> The paradox is that these coppers are typically English
                     in their style of manufacture but this 1785 series was unknown to <name type="pname">Batty</name> since it was not represented in his
                     collection of over 35,000 coppers. None bearing this date has ever been located in <name type="place">England</name>, a fact which has
                     prompted <name type="pname">Newman</name> to conclude that these 1785 varieties were made in <name type="place">England</name> solely for
                     export to <name type="place">British North America</name>. Whereas this whole raft of English manufactured copper counterfeits listed above
                     circulated widely in <name type="place">England</name> and the New World, the spurious 1785-dated issues enjoy a special place as a
                     distinctly colonial coinage.</p>
                  <p>Another source of domestic counterfeit English halfpence has recently been introduced to the numismatic literature by <name type="pname"
                        >Trudgen</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n79">79</ref> Prior to 1774 in <name type="place">Fort Crown Point</name>, <name type="place">New
                        York</name>, <name type="place">William Gilfoil</name>, a private in the 26th Regiment of the British Army, who served as a blacksmith,
                     was known to have "beat out" coppers which passed locally as halfpence at the current rate of 14 to the shilling. Nothing is known
                     regarding the design on these early American "blacksmith tokens," or their method of manufacture, whether cast or hammered.</p>
                  <p>Counterfeit coppers were ubiquitous. In <name type="pname">England</name>, a 1787 examination of false halfpence conducted by the Tower
                     Mint stated that "'8 percent had tolerable resemblance to the king's <pb n="122"/> coin; 43 per cent were blatantly inferior; 12 per cent
                     were blanks; and the balance [37%] was trash which would disgrace common sense to suppose it accepted for coins'."<ref target="#CH5-n80"

                     buried in 1788, 56 of the 72 inventoried counterfeit halfpence were of English manufacture while the remainder have been attributed to

                  <p>The counterfeit English halfpence of this era earned the generic name "<name type="place">Birmingham</name> coppers" or "Brummagens" after
                     the city of origin while in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> the invective "<name type="place">Bungtown</name>" was applied to any
                     counterfeit copper, irrespective of source.<ref target="#CH5-n84">84</ref> The prime reasons for the propagation of "<name type="place"
                        >Birmingham</name> coppers" was that the enterprise was profitable, as <name type="pname">Harris</name> had noted, and the risks minimal
                     since in <name type="place">England</name> counterfeiting copper coinage was pretty well ignored by authorities and treated only as a
                     misdemeanor although after 1742, conviction drew a two year prison sentence. The falsification of gold or silver, however, had always been
                     a felony punishable by death. <name type="pname">Barnard</name> concluded that this obvious inequity within the legal system for
                     counterfeiting precious versus base metals identified the prejudicial attitude of the wealthy, ruling elite toward the poorer working
                     classes who would stand to suffer more economic damage from illegal, lightweight coppers. It was not unusual for common laborers to receive
                     their wages in counterfeit coppers which merchants might only accept at a discount, if at all.<ref target="#CH5-n85">85</ref> In the
                     colonies, the laws against counterfeiting were inconsistent, with punishments varying from the pillory to the gallows. As the eighteenth
                     century progressed, more severe sentences were pronounced not only for the falsification of coins but for the alteration and printing of
                     paper money.<ref target="#CH5-n86">86</ref>

                        measure "for the encouraging of coinage" (<name type="pname">Feavearyear</name>, <hi rend="italic">Pound Sterling</hi>, pp. 95-96). This
                        arrangement differed from the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Bay Mint where minting costs for "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name>
                        Money" were the responsibility of the individual who brought specie to the mint for recoining and were not assumed by the Province.</p>

               <head>"EVASIVE" ISSUES</head>
               <p>A loophole existed in English statutes. There was only a restriction against the manufacture of coppers which "resembled" regal halfpence but
                  no restraint existed if the bogus copper were not an exact copy.<ref target="#CH5-n87">87</ref> Because of this legal ambiguity, a thriving
                  business developed in the production of "evasive halfpence" which had only a similarity to the real coins with legends of a non-regal nature
                  such as <name type="pname">GEORGIUS III</name> RUX, <name type="pname">GOERGIUV III</name> PAX, and on the reverse, <name type="place"
                     >BRITAIN</name> RULES, BONNY GIRL, and BRITISH TARS. While these coins were not counterfeits under a legal definition, they were foisted
                  upon the poor and illiterate and inflicted as much economic damage on these classes had they been outlawed. <name type="place"
                     >Birmingham</name> was the business center for this activity of "evasive" money as it was also for counterfeits,<ref target="#CH5-n88"
                     >88</ref> but other evasives were minted in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, <name type="place">Bilston</name>, and <name type="place"
                     >Wolverhampton</name>. Substantial profits were made by the manufacturers and "smashers" (utterers or passers) of these evasive issues
                  which were produced in great numbers and sold "at the rate of 28/- to 30/- worth for a good guinea."<ref target="#CH5-n89">89</ref> These
                  coins circulated in areas where royal coppers were in short supply and did fill a need. <name type="pname">Atkins</name> catalogued some 491
                  different varieties of evasives with many more recently discovered.<ref target="#CH5-n90">90</ref>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Crosby</name> listed several evasive halfpence in his book which he mistakenly identified with the American series as
                  contemporary English counterfeits.<ref target="#CH5-n91">91</ref> However, there is no evidence that evasive halfpence ever circulated in
                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> nor is there any report of such pieces being recovered in accumulations or hoards of the colonial period.
                  There is some indication that the evasives were introduced into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> as collectors' items between 1877 and
                     1883.<ref target="#CH5-n92">92</ref> Further research has shown that the legends on these evasive pieces parodied historical events from
                  1776 through the French Revolution and into the early years of the Napoleonic Wars, and thus belong to an era substantially beyond the
                  American colonial period.<ref target="#CH5-n93">93</ref> No reliance can be placed on the dates or monarch appearing on the evasives as an
                  indication of their time of manufacture.</p>
               <p>The study of small change has thus extended from a brief description of early silver pieces, through the various cycles of merchant tokens,
                  and finally into the period of regal patent and official copper and tin coinages. Of equal interest to the legally minted coins is the
                  parallel appearance of counterfeit coppers whose manufacture was promoted because of the potential for a quick profit against which there was
                  little personal risk. Legitimate and false English coppers together saw extensive service in <name type="place">British North America</name>
                  as the small change of the colonists, and their presence is well documented in contemporary accounts. From such supporting evidence it is
                  appropriate to include the genuine and counterfeit farthings and halfpence from their beginnings with <name type="pname">Charles II</name>
                  through the first coinage of <name type="pname">George III</name> as part of the American Colonial series. Without argument, the 1749 English
                  farthings and halfpence exported for use in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> are as distinctly "American" as the Spanish milled
                  dollar.</p>
               <p>Thus, the English series of coppers, both the legal and spurious, and their North American connections, have been examined up through the time
                  of the Revolution. The story is far from over since English coppers take on a new complexion in our numismatic history during the period of
                  the Confederation. The successful counterfeiting experience for regal coppers in <name type="place">England</name> no doubt encouraged
                  establishment of the practice in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> where it is believed to have flourished under the hands of <name
                     type="pname">Captain Thomas Machin</name> and others yet to be identified. The continuing saga of English copper coinages, genuine and
                  false, will be resumed in subsequent chapters.</p>

               <head>IRISH COPPER CURRENCY; THE <name type="pname">ST. PATRICK</name> COPPERS</head>
               <p>Our attention now shifts to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> where the shortage of small coinage was as acute as it was in <name type="place"
                     >England</name> during the seventeenth century. The royal patent farthings of 1613 to 1644 were also intended to pass current in <name
                     type="place">Ireland</name>, but these very lightweight pieces proved unpopular and production ceased in 1642. To facilitate trade, a
                  number of merchant tokens and other divers coppers appeared in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, generally with the promise of redemption by
                  the specific issuing individual. These promissory notes were about the size of a standard farthing, although thinner, and most of them passed
                  for one penny.<ref target="#CH5-n94">94</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Lindsay</name> catalogued 195 such "Town pieces and Tradesmen's tokens" from the time of the Commonwealth until the end of
                  the reign of <name type="pname">George II</name>. The tokens were dated in three clusters; the first primarily included the years 1654 to
                  1673, the next span was 1677 to 1679, while the last sequence appeared from 1728 to 1735.<ref target="#CH5-n95">95</ref> The hiatus between
                  1673 and 1677 was due to the decree of October 17, 1673, stipulating that no tokens could be produced without a royal license. The
                  effectiveness of this proclamation in stemming the production of tokens is evidenced by <name type="pname">Lindsay</name> who found none dated
                  between 1673 and 1676. The problem of the small change shortage was satisfactorily addressed on May 18, 1680, when letters patent were granted
                  to <name type="pname">Sir Thomas Armstrong</name> and <name type="pname">Colonel George Legg</name> to mint legal tender copper halfpence for
                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> for a term of 21 years. These halfpence were of good weight, 110 grains each, and the monopoly was
                  secured by the decree of July 19, 1680, which outlawed all other copper tokens. These royal patent halfpence, minted from 1680 to 1684, were
                  described by <name type="pname">Simon</name> as "certainly the best and handsomest copper money yet struck in, or for <name type="place"
                     >Ireland</name>."<ref target="#CH5-n96">96</ref>

               </figure>
               <p>During the second half of the seventeenth century and within the context of the small change shortage, there appeared two different <name
                     type="pname">St. Patrick</name> copper tokens which figured prominently in the American colonial period. Nothing suggests that the <name
                     type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coppers were promissory merchants' notes, but instead were a true token coinage. The origin of this series
                  still remains shrouded in mystery but recent research has expanded our knowledge. The obverse of the elusive series portrays a <name
                     type="pname">King David</name>-like figure playing his harp with the crown of <name type="place">England</name> above. To provide the
                  illusion of gold, the crown is accentuated by a brass splasher which is also an anti-counterfeiting measure; the legend, FLOREAT REX (May the
                     <name type="pname">King</name> Prosper), indicates support of the monarchy. The reverse of the larger coin, or so-called halfpenny, shows
                  the mitred <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> as the central figure holding his cross out to the people. To his left is a shield with three
                  castles, the arms of the <name type="place">City of Dublin</name>, and the inscription, ECCE GREX (Behold the <pb n="125"/> flock), surrounds
                  the design. The reverse of the smaller coin, or alleged farthing, again shows <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> as the central figure but
                  in this instance he holds a double, or metropolitan cross, in his left hand. His right arm extends over a "parcel of serpents ... as if
                  driving them out of the church" which is to <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name>'s left side. QVIESCAT PLEBS (May the people be at ease), is
                  the accompanying legend. Several theories have been proposed as to the provenance of these coppers which are interesting to recount.</p>
               <p>Early numismatists considered the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> series to have been struck pursuant to an act of the Kilkenny Assembly
                  of 1642 by the Catholic confederacy in defiance of the "Malignant" Puritanical Parliamentary forces. A passage in this act relating to "an
                  institution and order of knighthood, concerning the honour of <name type="pname">Saint Patrick</name>, and the glory of this kingdom" was so
                  suggestive of the allusion conveyed by themes on these tokens, that <name type="pname">Simon</name> was convinced of the relationship of this
                  series to the "rebel" Irish forces. He even postulated that the snakes <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> was chasing out of the church
                  were a direct reference to "the malignant party," or "protestants."<ref target="#CH5-n97">97</ref> A second theory also ascribes the coinage
                  to the reign of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_67750325">Charles I</name>, around 1645. Instead of being of Irish manufacture, the <name type="pname">St.
                     Patrick</name> coppers are attributed to the Tower Mint from dies engraved by <name type="pname">Nicholas Briot</name> and punch-linked to
                  his Scottish pieces.<ref target="#CH5-n98">98</ref> It was further postulated that the Roman Catholic symbolism explained why this coinage was
                  not circulated during the anti-royal and anti-papist sentiment of the Commonwealth era. Other sources place the coinage still around 1645 but
                  on the order of the Earl of Glamorgan who attempted to raise an Irish army against <name type="pname">Cromwell</name>'s forces in the siege of
                     Chester.<ref target="#CH5-n99">99</ref>
               </p>
               <p>More recent work compiled by <name type="pname">Hodder</name> dates the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> tokens after the Restoration of
                  the monarchy to the period 1672 to 1675.<ref target="#CH5-n100">100</ref> The dates coincide with the era of the proliferation of merchants'
                  promissory tokens just described. The arms of <name type="place">Dublin</name> on the larger coin and the 1681 observation of a contemporary
                  writer that the piece passed as a halfpenny are strong evidence of an Irish origin from <name type="place">Dublin</name>. The fact that a
                     <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> "farthing" was recovered from a ship wrecked on March 25, 1675, helps establish the early limit of
                  its manufacture. The reverse design of the "farthing" is very similar to that of the penny token issued by the merchant, <name type="pname"
                     >Richard Greenwood</name>, of High Street, <name type="place">Dublin</name>. <name type="pname">Simon</name> ascribes Greenwood's token and
                  six others to the period of the Commonwealth. A generic description of these seven issues indicates they "are made of brass, or copper, not
                  broader, but thinner than our present farthings, and like so many promissory notes passed for one penny each, in the neighbourhood, and
                  amongst the customers of those who issued them, whose names, together with the value 1d. and their coat of arms, sign, or cypher, are printed
                  on their respective pieces ...."<ref target="#CH5-n101">101</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There has long been the tradition that the obverse figure of <name type="pname">King David</name> is an allegorical reference to <name
                     type="pname">Charles I. Hodder</name> points out in his study that this biblical theme appeared on several earlier European pieces and
                  clearly was not original with the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> series. He further describes the imagery as "one of non-specific
                  royalist sentiments clothed in quasi-religious symbolism redolent of <name type="pname">Caroline</name> divine right theory." <name
                     type="pname">Hodder</name> summarizes the available information to support the belief that the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> tokens
                  were a semi-official coinage struck in <name type="place">Dublin</name> around 1672 to 1675, perhaps with the sanction of the <name
                     type="pname">Lord Lieutenant</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, the <name type="place">Earl of Essex</name>, who was the author
                  of the decree of October 17, 1673, regulating all token coinage. The occurrence of this series in silver and gold, the inclusion of a brass
                  splasher, and a reeded edge similarly suggest sophistication in their manufacture and sponsorship.</p>
               <p>Although the current evidence provides a logical explanation about the origin of the series, there are still unanswered questions about the
                  nature and value of the coins themselves. <name type="pname">Simon</name> felt they were halfpence and farthings whereas <name type="pname"
                     >Batty</name>, <name type="pname">Lindsay</name>, and "other distinguished <pb n="126"/> Numismatists" considered them halfpence and
                     pennies.<ref target="#CH5-n102">102</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Simon</name> calculated the larger coin at 130 to 135 grains, and the smaller at 90 to 106 grains.<ref target="#CH5-n103"
                     >103</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Lindsay</name>'s specimens were 133 and from 86 to 89 grains, respectively.<ref target="#CH5-n104">104</ref> Analysis of
                  specimens from recent auctions and private collections reveal an average weight of 135.7 ¬± 9.5 for 21 larger coins or "halfpence," and an
                  average of 92.3 ¬± 9.2 for 46 "farthings."<ref target="#CH5-n105">105</ref> From this 1:1.47 weight ratio, it is evident that the two coins are
                  not related to each other as a typical farthing to halfpenny with a 1:2 relationship.</p>

               <p>In order to study the relationship between the two <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> tokens, it is important to recall the weights of
                  other Irish coppers of the period (see Table 13). One should bear in mind that for any coin to circulate, it must be acceptable in commerce
                  based on either its intrinsic or acceptable token value. Typically such tokens were minted at a considerable profit to the authors. Numismatic
                  history is replete with examples of rejected coinages which the citizenry considered lightweight and overvalued. The unpopular copper
                  farthings of the <name type="place">Harington</name>, <name type="place">Lennox</name>, <name type="place">Richmond</name> and <name
                     type="place">Maltravers</name> patents are good examples. In comparing the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coinages with other
                  coppers of the period, some insight may be gathered as they are examined within the context of other circulating coinages thus better defining
                  their contemporary value.</p>
               <p>The official coinage closest in time to the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> token are those <name type="pname">Charles II</name> Irish
                  halfpence minted from 1680 to 1684 under the <name type="pname">Armstrong</name> and <name type="pname">Legg</name> patent which required a
                  halfpenny to weigh 110 grains. <name type="pname">Simon</name> observed that this requirement was consistently met if not exceeded.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n106">106</ref> The issue also carried the approval of <name type="pname">Dean Jonathan Swift</name> who, in his third
                  Drapier's letter, considered the 1680 halfpence superior in weight and metal composition to <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s halfpence.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n107">107</ref> From these data it is evident that the Irish coinage had less intrinsic and more token value than the
                  corresponding English coppers, thus providing a greater profit margin for the Irish patentees. Another contemporary token was the 1679 <name
                     type="place">Dublin</name> halfpenny, probably a semi-official issue, which <name type="pname">Simon</name> remarked was "very fair ... of
                  the bigness of our present half-penny" which in 1749, when he wrote, would have weighed 134.6 grains.<ref target="#CH5-n108">108</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The problem remains that the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> halfpenny is heavier than the official patent halfpenny coinage of the
                  period, although it compares favorably to the <name type="place">Dublin</name> halfpenny which also bears the arms of the city. Therefore, all
                  three issues, the larger <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coin, the <name type="place">Dublin</name> halfpenny, and the regal halfpenny
                  starting with <name type="pname">George II</name> weigh in the same order of magnitude. If the heaviness of the halfpenny presents a problem,
                  then the smaller <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coin of 92 grains is a greater enigma since one might reasonably expect that it is far
                  too heavy to have been minted as a token farthing, which in the time of <name type="pname">Charles II</name> weighed from 22.5 to 28
                     grains.<ref target="#CH5-n109">109</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In considering all the available evidence, it is difficult to conceive that the two <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coins are related to
                  each other as farthing and halfpenny. Not only are their relative weights incorrect, but the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> "farthing"
                  would even be heavier than the corresponding regal English farthing of <name type="pname">Charles II</name>. In a period of tokens and
                  lightweight coins, it would be unlikely for its sponsors to have minted a heavier <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> farthing for <name
                     type="place">Ireland</name>. The near 1:1.5 weight ratio is more consistent with a halfpenny and three-farthing. In regard to sheer
                  numbers, there are considerably more farthings than halfpence‚Äîwhile the estimated number of farthing die varieties is in the vicinity of
                     120,<ref target="#CH5-n110">110</ref> only 10 varieties for the halfpence have thus far been identified.<ref target="#CH5-n111">111</ref>
                  Typically, six-sevenths of the coppers minted were halfpence, but here the situation is reversed by a considerable ratio, since the <name
                     type="pname">St. Patrick</name> "farthing" is significantly more common than the "halfpenny."<ref target="#CH5-n112">112</ref> Writing in
                  1839, <name type="pname">Lindsay</name> proposed that the larger coin was a Rarity 6 out of 8, while the smaller was a Rarity 2 out of 8, and
                  as numismatic items, the halfpenny was worth about 5 times more than the farthing.<ref target="#CH5-n113">113</ref> Only the smaller coin
                  comes in <pb n="128"/> silver perhaps as a presentation piece. One puzzling fact is that in all contemporary references, only the halfpenny is
                  mentioned. Where was the "farthing" and why was it omitted from these discussions? There are two considerations; the first is, what were the
                  intended denominations when the two coins were originally issued, and next, for what rate did they pass subsequently?</p>
               <p>There is an explanation that can reconcile these seeming disparities; both coins were originally struck as halfpenny tokens although the later
                  rating may have changed by custom. Such an answer is just as reasonable as the attempt to designate them farthings and halfpence. Consider the
                  possibility that the larger halfpence varieties were minted first in small numbers; because of the added expense for the larger coins and the
                  increased die wear, it became more profitable to mint smaller coins of lesser weight. The style and technique improved and presentation issues
                  were produced. A clue in support of this hypothesis comes from <name type="pname">Swift</name>'s "Drapier's Letter III" as he wrote in 1724 of
                  "the small <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name>'s coin, which passes <hi rend="italic">now</hi> [emphasis added] for a farthing" suggesting
                  that it may not always have done so.<ref target="#CH5-n114">114</ref> He next spoke of "the great <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name>'s
                  halfpence" implying the existence of both small and great halfpence and that <hi rend="italic">now</hi> the small <name type="pname">St.
                     Patrick</name> coin passed as farthings. However apocryphal this deviation from traditional wisdom may appear, the fact remains that while
                  the larger <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coin may well be a halfpenny, the smaller issue cannot have been a farthing when measured by
                  the same criteria.</p>
               <p>More is known about the circulation of the coinage but still there are unanswered questions in this area. The <name type="pname">St.
                     Patrick</name>'s tokens were introduced into the <name type="place">Isle of Mann</name> where they were current during the minority of its
                  hereditary lord, the <name type="place">Earl of Derby</name>. When he came of age in 1679, the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> money was
                  demonetized in favor of a local token currency.<ref target="#CH5-n115">115</ref> Following the Manx rejection, these unwanted tokens somehow
                  came into the possession of <name type="pname">Mark Newby</name>, an English Quaker who was established as a merchant in <name type="place"
                     >Dublin</name> where he suffered religious persecution. In 1681, at age 43, <name type="pname">Newby</name> and his family emigrated from
                     <name type="place">Dublin</name> to <name type="place">West New Jersey</name> to settle in a Quaker community established by <name
                     type="pname">William Penn</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n116">116</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Newby</name> brought an unknown quantity of the larger <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> tokens with him, probably
                  acquired in bulk and at a considerable discount. <name type="pname">Newby</name> was elected to the <name type="place">West Jersey</name>
                  Assembly which, in May 1682, authorized the tokens to pass as legal tender. Prior to that time, only wampum was available as small change
                     currency.<ref target="#CH5-n117">117</ref> Mention is made only of the halfpence which were to "pass for half-pence Current pay of this
                  Province." The exchange rate for <name type="pname">Newby</name>'s coppers was not specified in the enabling legislation except by the vague
                  phrase "for pay Equivalent." It has not been proven that any of the smaller tokens ever circulated in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>, but
                  had they, they would have been rated as halfpence since no other schedule was published. In 1682, the exchange rate for <name type="place"
                     >West New Jersey</name>, as determined by <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>, was 133.33:100, money of account to sterling. "Pay
                  Equivalent" would therefore have been 18 coppers to the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> shilling.<ref target="#CH5-n118">118</ref> It is
                  to be recalled that <name type="place">New Jersey</name> was split into West and East from 1676 until 1702, with the eastern section following
                  the monetary practices of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> while the western part adhered to those of <name type="place"
                  >Pennsylvania</name>. <name type="pname">Newby</name> was required to post surety for the token coinage and after his death within the
                  following year, his estate redeemed ¬£30 of the coppers which would have totaled 10,800 coins at the current exchange rate. There is no mention
                  of the smaller farthing denomination in any of these records or deliberations. Only the larger ones have been found in the <pb n="129"/>
                     ground,<ref target="#CH5-n119">119</ref> but "farthings" have been reported in uncontrolled accumlations.<ref target="#CH5-n120">120</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Stickney</name> observed in 1859 that <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> pieces were rarely found in <name type="place"
                     >New Jersey</name> and that he had to send to <name type="place">England</name> to obtain good specimens for his personal collection.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n121">121</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Following the speculation that <name type="pname">Newby</name> acquired the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> tokens at a significant
                  discount when they were demonetized on the <name type="place">Isle of Mann</name>, there was potential for considerable gain when he brought
                  them to <name type="place">New Jersey</name>. The level of profit is difficult to calculate since so many unknowns shroud this series.
                  Assuming mint costs similar to the Tower Mint and the weight of the halfpenny at 135.7 grains, or 51.6 coins per pound, figures similar to
                  those in Table 10 can be constructed to show the profit for the unknown sponsor of the series. Table 14 also demonstrates the profit for the
                  smaller <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coin if it were to pass either as a farthing or halfpenny. The table expresses these values in
                  Irish currency whose exchange rate to English during the 1672 to 1675 period was 105.56:100.00. The presumed costs of minting the coppers are
                  from Table 10 for 1672, assuming there was no Swedish export tax for the metal. Since the discount, if any, at which <name type="pname"
                     >Newby</name> acquired this hoard of coppers is unknown, his profit realized in <name type="place">New Jersey</name> cannot be
                  estimated.</p>

               <p>Inspection of Table 14 shows that the profit margin for the smaller <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coin to pass as a farthing is a
                  scant 9.8%, while that for the larger <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> halfpenny is almost 50%. If the smaller coin were to pass as a
                  halfpenny, then the profit would be more compatible with the patent halfpenny of the period from Table 13, which, at 110 grains, would accrue
                  an 84% gain to the patentee. This aspect of potential profit is a further reason to suspect that the smaller <name type="pname">St.
                     Patrick</name> was originally intended to be a halfpenny, although it may have later passed as a farthing as the weight of Irish coins
                  increased. Whatever facts may eventually be uncovered, it remains unsatisfactory to consider the two <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name>
                  coppers as companion coinages in a farthing-halfpenny relationship. The "farthing" is too heavy to be a farthing and the profit margin of 9.8%
                  is too meager for a token coinage, considering the profit potential for the larger coin at 49.1%. If the farthing were never intended to
                  exist, it would explain the lack of correspondence in weight between a so-called farthing and halfpenny, the relative rarity of an earlier
                  minted larger coin, and the lack of contemporary discussion about the farthing. This would <pb n="130"/> assume that the smaller planchet
                  token was easier to mint than the larger, whose manufacture was abandoned after ten or so die combinations. This novel proposal that the <name
                     type="pname">St. Patrick</name> tokens were originally intended as two sizes of halfpence may be a leap into fantasy, but it is no less
                  plausible than to call them farthing and halfpenny. This hypothesis is substantiated by calculation of the potential profit of the coinages, a
                  very important factor to examine when considering the economic determinants of minting and the dynamics of circulation. In later years, by
                  custom, they could have passed as farthing and halfpenny. If judged by weight alone, the halfpence and three-farthings demoninations are the
                  most logical.<ref target="#CH5-n122">122</ref> Dolley also stresses the distinction between the value of the tokens "at the time of their

               <head>THE COINAGES OF <name type="pname">WILLIAM WOOD</name>
               </head>
               <p>In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, the implacable resistance to the <name type="place">Hibernia</name> coinages of <name type="pname"
                     >William Wood</name> mounted by a determined surge of Irish nationalism, adds another interesting dimension to the study of numismatics.
                  The severe lack of minor coins persisted in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> well into the eighteenth century. The poorer classes were
                  victimized by a flood of unregulated and frequently worthless tokens. Circumstances were described to the king's Privy Council in 1724 in
                  which employers "have been obliged to give tallies or tokens in cards, to their workmen for want of small money, signed upon the back, to be
                  afterwards exchanged for larger money.... a premium was often given to obtain small money for necessary occasions." The report continued:
                     <q>The great want of small money was further proved by the common use of <hi rend="italic">raps</hi>,<ref target="#CH5-n124">124</ref> a
                     counterfeit coin, of such base metal, that what passes for a halfpenny is not worth half a farthing, which raps appeared to have obtained a
                     currency out of necessity, and for want of better small money to make change with; and, by the best accounts,... there can be no doubt,
                     that there is a real want of small money in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> ...."<ref target="#CH5-n125">125</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the dual purpose of relieving this shortage of small coin as well as securing personal gain for the king and patentee, an issue of
                  farthings and halfpence was authorized by <name type="pname">George I</name> for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>. This favor was granted to
                  the king's mistress, the Duchess of <name type="pname">Kendal</name>, which she subsequently transferred to <name type="pname">Wood</name> for
                  ¬£10,000 on June 16, 1722. This patent entitled its owner to produce 360 tons of coins at 30 pence, Irish money,<ref target="#CH5-n126"
                     >126</ref> to the pound of copper over a period of 14 years.<ref target="#CH5-n127">127</ref> Of this amount, 100 tons were to be coined
                  the first year and 20 tons annually for the remaining life of the contract. The total value of the patent in Irish money amounted to <pb
                     n="131"/> ¬£100,800. Considering <name type="pname">Newton</name>'s estimate that 600 tons of coppers would be a sufficient quantity for all
                     <name type="place">England</name>, 360 tons for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> alone was "an absurd amount, almost one-fourth the total
                  value of all the Irish currency."<ref target="#CH5-n128">128</ref> Although the Irish economy needed an infusion of money, it was not copper
                  it lacked. "We have more halfpence than we need already. It is true we want change, but it is sixpences, shillings, halfcrowns, and
                     crowns."<ref target="#CH5-n129">129</ref> Since the proportion of copper in the money supply was to be so great with this new proposal for
                  360 tons, <q>the question of intrinsic value [became] vitally important, for the new coins would necessarily enter into all large payments,
                     would gradually displace gold and silver, and would place the country at a ruinous disadvantage in commerce .... Rightly or wrongly, all
                     classes believed that under these circumstances the small amount of precious metals in the country would all or nearly all pass to <name
                        type="place">England</name> in the shape of rent, leaving nothing but a debased copper coinage at home.<ref target="#CH5-n130">130</ref>

               <p>At that time in history, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> was economically destitute and living conditions were deplorable. <name
                     type="pname">Jonathan Swift</name>, the Dean of <name type="place">Dublin</name>'s Protestant Episcopal <name type="pname">St. Patrick
                     Cathedral</name>, had become a local hero striking out with "indignation against English tyranny in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>."
                  "Burn everything that comes from <name type="place">England</name> except the coal" was one of his injunctions to his countrymen.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n131">131</ref> When <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s coinage was prepared for the Irish without their knowledge, consultation
                  or consent, <name type="pname">Swift</name> attacked the action in a series of four letters purportedly penned by a <name type="place"
                     >Dublin</name> dry goods merchant, signed anonymously "M.B."<ref target="#CH5-n132">132</ref> This savage diatribe published in "The
                  Drapier's Letters" against <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s profiteering at the expense of "an impoverished voiceless people," whipped the
                  Irish people into a frenzy. "He set the country ablaze from <name type="place">Derry</name> to <name type="place">Cork</name>. <name
                     type="pname">Swift</name> did far more than to scourge the Government, he gave to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> a spirit she never knew
                  she had. He created a public opinion in a nation of slaves."<ref target="#CH5-n133">133</ref> In their interesting review of <name
                     type="pname">Swift</name> and the <name type="place">Hibernia</name> coinages, <name type="pname">Gale</name> and <name type="pname"
                     >Gale</name> ask the rhetorical question whether the drapier's rancor was taken literally by his countrymen. "There's no way to tell for
                  certain. One recent critic, <name type="pname">David Ward</name>, suggests that 'the sophisticated would enjoy the joke; the unsophisticated
                  would be scared out of their wits'."<ref target="#CH5-n134">134</ref> Regardless of how one may view <name type="pname">Swift</name>'s motives
                  or style, the impact of his activities remains indisputable, many feared having any identification with <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s
                  project and trembled at the accusation of having any of his coppers in their possession. Even newsboys (flying-stationers) were entreated
                  neither to accept nor give change for <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s coppers. <pb n="132"/>
                  <q>Let <name type="pname">Wood</name> and his accomplices travel about the country with cart-loads of their ware, and see who will take it off
                     their hands: there will be no fear of his being robbed, for a highwayman would scorn to touch it.<ref target="#CH5-n135">135</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Wood</name> countered these attacks and distortions of his motives with the injudicious retort "that he would cram his
                  brass down their throats in spite of them."<ref target="#CH5-n136">136</ref> This threat and the documented need for small change
                  notwithstanding, his money was completely rejected. <name type="pname">Swift</name>'s position prevailed. The terms of the patent were
                  initially reduced from 360 to 142.75 long tons, or ¬£40,000 (English); subsequently the contract was completely voided and in compensation for
                  his losses, <name type="pname">Wood</name> received a grant of ¬£24,000. <name type="pname">Simon</name> estimated that "About ¬£17,000 value of
                  these Halfpence and Farthings were sent over and uttered in this kingdom in the years 1722 and 1723."<ref target="#CH5-n137">137</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Although it is frequently repeated that <name type="pname">Wood</name> conspired to benefit at the expense of the Irish people, less has been
                  publicized in his defense. When the financial statements regarding his patent are scrutinized, it can be seen that <name type="pname"
                     >Wood</name> would have lost money over the course of the 14 years had the full terms of the patent been met, a circumstance hardly
                  deserving of the term "profiteering." In the analysis of the patent by <name type="pname">Swift</name> and <name type="pname">Simon</name>,
                  many hard facts were either ignored or conveniently distorted in order to support their nationalist position. The Privy Council report cited
                  above attempted to correct the misconceptions espoused by <name type="pname">Swift</name>. The document quoted the assay report prepared at
                  the Tower Mint by <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Newton</name> conducted on <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s coppers. This "trial of the pix"
                  demonstrated that this patent coinage surpassed the required weight and, when compared to the regal coppers since <name type="pname">Charles
                     II</name>, "considerably exceeds them all in weight, very far exceeds them all in goodness, fineness, and value of the copper." <name
                     type="pname">Wood</name>'s <name type="place">Hibernia</name> coppers "were heavier and intrinsically more valuable than any issued before
                  in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>."<ref target="#CH5-n138">138</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Newton</name> judged that the refined copper in <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s coins was worth about 13d. per pound while
                  the prepared copper fillets ready for coinage were worth 18d. <name type="pname">Simon</name>, in his interpretation of these statements,
                  asserted that the copper in <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s money "was not worth in the market above twelve or thirteen pence the pound,"
                  completely discounting the price of planchet preparation and minting, expenses that are traditionally absorbed in the nominal value of minor
                  coins. Calculating another 4d. for the actual coining. <name type="pname">Nelson</name> arrived at a total minting cost for <name type="pname"
                     >Wood</name> at 22d. per pound.<ref target="#CH5-n139">139</ref> Other fixed expenses included the ¬£10,000 paid by <name type="pname"
                     >Wood</name> to the Duchess of <name type="pname">Kendall</name> for the patent, and the annual "rent" of ¬£800 to the king, ¬£200 for the
                  king's clerk comptroller, and from his profits, <name type="pname">Wood</name> had to pay charges for transportation, distribution, and Irish
                  customs on his coins. These data are recorded in Table 15 where it is noted that at 60 halfpence to the pound, or at a weight of 116.7 grains
                  per halfpenny, <name type="pname">Wood</name> would have incurred a net loss of about ¬£4,871 over the 14 year term of the agreement. <name
                     type="pname">Nelson</name> made similar calculations but disregarded the exchange rate differential between <name type="place"
                     >England</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>. <name type="pname">Simon</name> claimed, on the basis of the average weight of four
                  randomly selected lots of halfpence, that <name type="pname">Wood</name> reduced the average weight of the halfpenny to 107.5 grains to
                  increase his profits. Although the samples which <name type="pname">Simon</name> and <name type="pname">Swift</name> quoted will never be
                  available for our inspection, an analysis of 164 <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s halfpence in Table 16 from current auction sales shows an
                  absolute conformity to the requirements of the patent. These data do not support <name type="pname">Simon</name>'s allegation that <name
                     type="pname">Wood</name>'s coinage was lightweight; it may be that this accusation of malfeasance was just another scheme to vilify and
                  discredit the patentee by his Irish enemies.</p>

               <p>The Irish, in denouncing the alleged fraud perpetrated upon them by <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s coinage, considered only the intrinsic
                  value of the copper at 12d., Irish, per pound, and ignored the costs of planchet preparation and the various mint fees and royalties. <name
                     type="pname">Swift</name> would have been entirely correct in his condemnation of <name type="pname">Wood</name> if the preceding expenses
                  could have been legitimately omitted. If labor and manufacturing costs for 360 tons of copper coins passing at ¬£100,800 <pb n="134"/> (Irish)
                  could indeed have been ignored, then a ¬£60,480 loss would have been sustained by the Irish public as <name type="pname">Swift</name> asserted;
                  if the halfpenny had been reduced in weight to 107.5 grains, as claimed, then the loss would have been increased to ¬£69,064 16s. The mint
                  costs could not be waived, and when these were borne by <name type="pname">Wood</name>, he suffered an economic loss. When <name type="pname"
                     >Wood</name>'s coinage was rejected by the Irish and did not circulate, the Crown indemnified him for his efforts with a pension of ¬£3,000
                  annually for eight years.</p>
               <p>There is possibly more to this story of Irish nationalism then just patriotism. <name type="pname">Craig</name> notes that <name type="pname"
                     >Swift</name> "distorted" <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s project at a time when he suffered personal disappointment at having been denied
                  a bishopric.<ref target="#CH5-n140">140</ref> He further elaborates that some of those who created such ferment about <name type="pname"
                     >Wood</name>'s <name type="place">Hibernia</name> coinage were members of the Irish Parliament, who themselves, were profiteering from the
                  issue of token coppers. In their review, <name type="pname">Gale</name> and <name type="pname">Gale</name> quote some biographers who
                  incorrectly asserted that the malice with which <name type="pname">Swift</name> attacked his adversaries was symptomatic of an "incipient
                  insanity." Others "recognized the savage vituperation as typical political invective of the time, not to be taken too seriously."<ref
                     target="#CH5-n141">141</ref> In 1729, <name type="pname">Swift</name> proposed a token scheme to which he, himself, would be a party, but

               </p>
               <p>It has been maintained that large numbers of unwanted <name type="place">Hibernia</name> coppers, following their rejection in <name
                     type="place">Ireland</name>, found their way to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> and have appeared in accumulations of various and sundry
                  other coins of the period.<ref target="#CH5-n143">143</ref> There is no evidence of any substantial colonial circulation for these coppers,
                  numismatic catalogues and trade publications notwithstanding, although it can be reasonably concluded that any current European coins could
                  have ended up in <name type="place">North America</name>, either brought over by the steady stream of immigrants or in the merchant trade. The
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> legislature report, quoted by <name type="pname">Crosby</name>, contains a generic reference to Irish
                  halfpence "with a bust on one side, and a harp on the other." While no specific dates or monarchs are mentioned, the description matches the
                  later regal varieties of <name type="pname">George II</name> and <name type="pname">George III</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n144">144</ref> The
                  history of <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s Irish coinage was recalled both in a debate in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> Common
                  Council during the "coppers panic" of 1789 and in a news release datelined <name type="place">New York City</name>, without any hint given

                     >Wood</name>'s halfpence were reported by <name type="pname">Newman</name> in company with the counterfeit 1699 <name type="pname">William
                     III</name> halfpence in "The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> Highway Find," but this deposit was located in the vicinity of a former
                  seafarers' haunt. These coppers could have been dropped there by any sailor patronizing the local tavern without any inference as to a general
                  circulation. In <name type="pname">Stickney</name>'s essay of 1859, he discussed in detail the <name type="pname">St. Patrick</name> coinages
                  and the failure of local circulation for the Rosa Americana series without any acknowledgment of <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s Irish coins.
                  It would have been unlikely that <name type="pname">Wood</name> or any other businessman would have invested in sending <name type="place"
                     >Hibernia</name> coppers to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> right on the heels on the Rosa Americana failure. <name type="pname"
                     >Crosby</name> only mentions the <name type="place">Hibernia</name> series in relationship to the better known Rosa Americana products of
                     <name type="pname">Wood</name>. <name type="pname">Prime</name> stated in 1861 that <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s <name type="place"
                     >Hibernia</name> coppers could still be found in circulation in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> but this is no testimony as to when they

                  <name type="pname">Breen</name> has associated the widespread importation of several styles of <name type="place">Washington</name> "cent"
                  tokens from <name type="place">Birmingham</name> with the coin shortage of 1815 to 1817.<ref target="#CH5-n147">147</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Doty</name> reported that late eighteenth century English trade tokens, once they were no <pb n="135"/> longer required for
                  the small change medium in <name type="place">Great Britain</name>, were imported into the <name type="place">United States</name> where they
                  circulated as substitute cents in such places as <name type="place">Savannah</name>, <name type="place">Georgia</name>, right up until the
                  Civil War.<ref target="#CH5-n148">148</ref> Why could this not have been the same occasion for the appearance of <name type="pname"
                     >Wood</name>'s Irish coppers? In support of this interpretation, it is recalled that evasive halfpence had once been considered a colonial
                  currency until demonstrated that they were an import of the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In the later state coinages when it was
                  commonplace to overstrike other lightweight coppers, no <name type="place">Hibernia</name> halfpence have ever been identified as host coins.
                  The nagging question as to the widespread currency of <name type="pname">Wood</name>'s <name type="place">Hibernia</name> coinages in <name

                  over a span of 14 years for an annual fee to the Crown of ¬£300.<ref target="#CH5-n149">149</ref> The resultant Rosa Americana coinage was

                  denominations of this emission are dated 1722, 1723, and 1724. One pound of alloy was to produce 120 halfpence, thus securing a substantial

                  profits derived from production of these coins after deduction for mint costs and transportation, would be deposited in the Irish public

               <p>In 1760, after a 13 years' lapse in the minting of regal Irish coppers, there appeared from <name type="place">Dublin</name> a lightweight

               <head>OTHER NORTH AMERICAN COPPERS</head>
               <p>There are other tokens of the late seventeenth century minted in <name type="place">England</name> which pertain to the American Colonies.
                  Included in this group of very rare tokens are the 1694 <name type="place">Carolina</name> and New <pb n="140"/> which passed for about ten
                  times intrinsic value!<ref target="#CH5-n170">170</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Crosby</name> suggested that the <name type="pname">Higley</name> coppers are so rare today because they were of high
                  quality copper and were in great demand by goldsmiths for use in alloys.</p>
               <p>The final authorization for the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> copper halfpence, the only legally sanctioned colonial coinage, was signed
                  on May 20, 1773 after several months of negotiations with English authorities.<ref target="#CH5-n171">171</ref> This coinage struck at the
                  Tower Mint was to weigh 60 to the pound and at a production cost of 20.86d. sterling, a profit of 16% accrued to the colony before
                  transportation and insurance costs were deducted. These well-made coins bearing the bust of <name type="pname">George III</name> on the
                  obverse and the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> crest on the reverse with the legend, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>, were to pass at
                  24 to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> shilling. The shipment arrived in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> on February 14, 1774, but
                  distribution was delayed until royal permission was received one year later, or only 50 days prior to the start of the Revolutionary War.
                  Consequently, the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence were hoarded and saw little circulation until after hostilities had ceased.
                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence obviously did circulate since many have been recovered in the excavations and restorations at
                     <name type="place">Colonial Williamsburg</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n172">172</ref> The availability of brilliant, uncirculated specimens
                  today is because of the cache of uncirculated coins that came into the possession of Colonel <name type="pname">Mendes I. Cohen</name> of
                     <name type="place">Baltimore</name> sometime around 1870.<ref target="#CH5-n173">173</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence were well made coins that attracted the attention of <name type="pname">Benjamin
                     Franklin</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n174">174</ref> Writing about them from his post in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> on January 5, 1774,
                  he commented, "<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> has lately had a Quantity of Copper Halfpence struck at the Mint here for their Province.
                  Inclos'd I send you a Specimen of theirs. They may serve to keep out the worthless counterfeit Trash of late so common." While such a
                  statement is complimentary of the quality of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> coinage, it also is an indication about the status of the
                  small change in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> just before the Revolution.</p>
               <p>At this point, our survey of colonial coinage approaches the brink of the American Revolution, a conflict which arose as the Plantations
                  looked for more economic self-determination while an equally resolute mother country strove to protect her markets and raw material supply; it
                  became a losing battle for <name type="place">England</name> to maintain her possessions in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> both prosperous
                  but dependent. Paper currency, a necessity to increase the visible money supply, had, generally speaking, achieved moderate stability despite
                  Parliamentary restrictions that were regarded as more protective of British investments than nurturing of colonial commerce.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n175">175</ref> Foreign silver, as recorded in the Proclamation of 1704, and gold coins were the primary hard money of the
                  period. The copper currency had undergone dilution with counterfeit English halfpence creating an absolute excess of small change. A
                  readjustment of exchange rates in the <pb n="141"/> mid-century kept the medium in circulation. Commodity monies were gradually being phased
                  out of former positions of importance as paper money gained in popularity. Bills of exchange continued to be the most important instruments of
                  foreign credit. This was the visible money supply, as indicated by <name type="pname">Ernst</name>, which played an important and vital role
                  in daily commerce.<ref target="#CH5-n176">176</ref> A total picture of colonial economics requires an evaluation of other factors such as
                  capital flow, and domestic and foreign debt and credit. For whatever reasons, political, economic or social, the Revolution was here. This
                  summary, although incomplete and abbreviated, has attempted to present the pertinent monetary and numismatic history leading up to this revolt
                  as well as lay the background for further events to be related during the Confederation period.</p>

            <p>Colonial <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>, at this point in numismatic history, was on the verge of achieving freedom from <name type="place"
                  >England</name>. Previous chapters have described the economic conditions within the colonies, emphasizing the cycles of recession and
               expansion which influenced the ready availability of circulating hard money. The colonies had no natural mineral wealth in gold and silver and
               relied on specie earned in the <name type="place">West Indies</name> trade with Spanish possessions. The mercantile theory of colonization
               favored English interests over American and discouraged colonial economic self-sufficiency. The scarcity of hard money for conducting commerce
               stimulated the development and use of alternative currency forms - wampum, bookkeeping barter, commodity monies, domestic silver coinages, and
               several options in a paper medium. In 1763, following cessation of the French and Indian Wars, <name type="place">England</name> directed more
               attention and energies toward <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. The increasing regulations placed on colonial trade and paper currency became
               chronic irritants and were factors in leading to the eventual independence of the colonies. The new liberty will introduce some changes in the
               domestic currency but many old traditions will continue as in the past.</p>

               <head>THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION</head>
               <p>Multiple factors have been identified in an effort to establish the causes of the American Revolution. Prominent among these were the economic
                  restraints which were imposed by <name type="place">England</name> especially after 1763, a time that coincided with a period of postwar
                  slowdown. The stage for confrontation was being set. <q>After 1760 colonists faced policymakers in <name type="place">Great Britain</name> who
                     were determined to change the loose and unrestrictive commercial empire within which the colonial economy had prospered, by increasing and
                     enforcing regulations and by tightening connections between business and politics. At the same time, American ability to influence policy
                     was in sharp decline.<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref>

                  <p>(a) A TRIO OF TWO SHILLING SIX PENCE TAX STAMPS. The Stamp Act of 1765 was passed by Parliament on March 22, 1765, to raise money to
                     support the British troops stationed in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. Such tax stamps were required on all legal documents, licenses,
                     and even newspapers within the colonies. Organized opposition to this "taxation without representation" was intense. The colonial position
                     against this tax was championed in Parliament by <name type="pname">Sir William Pitt</name> whose intervention resulted in repeal of this
                     unpopular provision on March 18, 1766. Courtesy American Antiquarian Society.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Besides these commercial and economic factors, there was the developing influence of a class of wealthy and powerful "elite" who sought
                  autonomy from the crown. At the other end of the social ladder were the "lower orders" or "poorer sort," who, while never in control, voiced
                  their individual grievances and demands. Of this relationship it has been said, "the wealthier patriots in the cities ... used the colonial
                  'mob' to their own ends, directing its furies against stamp distributors and customs officials." Lest we become too persuaded by the romantic
                  imagery of a war fought by oppressed citizens striking out for freedom, the further caution must be added that while "lower-class movements
                  and social upheaval may in part characterize the Revolutionary movement; they do not explain it."<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas the relative contributions of the economic, social, and political influences remain incalculable, their composite effect was that
                  conflict became inevitable and at last occurred on April 19, 1775, at the Battles of <name type="place">Lexington</name> and <name

               <p>Another committee selected by that Second Continental Congress in July of 1776 was assigned the task of composing a constitution by which
                  these new states would launch themselves as a free nation. These Articles of Confederation were the subject of heated debate for 16 months
                  before approval by Congress. Those six colonies with fixed boundaries were unwilling to accept this document until some provision was made for
                  those western lands claimed by the other seven, which by compromise became part of the national domain. The new constitution was forwarded to
                  the state legislatures for ratification but did not come into effect until March 1, 1781, when <name type="place">Maryland</name> became the
                  last of the required nine states to mark its approval.<ref target="#CH6-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Articles of Confederation were a very weak instrument providing only for a "firm league of friendship" between the several states,
                  primarily to ensure mutual defense and security of liberties, but did not establish a single nation. "The thirteen states approved a document
                  that in effect gave no more power to Congress than the colonies had been willing to give to Parliament."<ref target="#CH6-n7">7</ref> The
                  states maintained all those powers not explicitly delegated to the Continental Congress. Only the state legislatures could levy taxes and when
                  the national government required funds, requests for money would be forwarded to the states according to a specific formula. In an area of
                  parallel authority, the states and the national government could each establish mints and print paper money. Within the Congress, each state
                  had a single vote and only a simple majority was necessary for most legislation. However, nine votes were required in Congress to coin money,
                  to regulate the alloy thereof, to emit paper money, to borrow and appropriate money, to declare war, to enter into treaties and alliances, and
                  to regulate the size <pb n="147"/> and composition of the armed forces. It was evident that the states exercised extreme caution before
                  abdicating to the new Congress of the Confederation their individual interests in areas of finance, foreign policy, and war powers.</p>

                  had been paid by 1784.<ref target="#CH6-n15">15</ref> A recent study by <name type="pname">Anderson</name> describes and illustrates other
                  fiscal paper of the period.<ref target="#CH6-n16">16</ref> These certificates of public debt issued by the states and Continental Congress, in
                  addition to paper money, were another means by which the War was financed. Whereas bills of credit were intended as a circulating paper
                  currency and payable to the bearer, these usually interest-bearing debt certificates for private loans to the government were issued to
                  specified individuals. Although these notes were transferable, they were not intended for general circulation, and while not legal tender,
                  they were generally receivable for taxes.</p>
               <p>Another Revolutionary War expense which remains incalculable was the value for goods and services impressed from the general public for
                  military consumption.<ref target="#CH6-n17">17</ref> As early as December 1776, General <name type="place">Washington</name> was authorized by
                  Congress to commandeer any necessary supplies for the war effort in exchange for which the owners, willingly or not, were recompensed with
                  Quartermaster or Commissary certificates as "reasonable" payment. This "mass expropriation" of civilian commodities prompted popular unrest
                  and amounted to "legal robbery."<ref target="#CH6-n18">18</ref> The total of these certificates is unknown, but those issued by the Federal
                  government alone may have approached the entire sum of the Continental currency, both instruments depreciating tremendously in real value as
                  inflation mounted. This massive certificate debt proved a significant financial burden; some states received them for taxes while others were
                  sorely tempted to emit paper money to cover this indebtedness. The Continental currency and Quartermaster certificates, considered the "common
                  debt" of the war, were redeemed at depreciated values, whereas the private loan certificates mentioned above, were "preferred securities" and
                  received more favorable consideration from Congress in their liquidation.</p>
               <p>Following the Declaration of Independence another element of complexity was added to the monetary system. The Continental dollar became the
                  money of account for the Federal government and was made equivalent to the Spanish milled dollar. Since the Spanish standard did not have a
                  uniform value among the states' monies of account, neither could the Continental dollar.<ref target="#CH6-n19">19</ref> Because the
                  Continental Congress had a permanent base in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>, the finances of the Revolution were typically expressed
                  in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> funds where the Spanish milled dollar (and now the Continental dollar) passed at 7s. 6d., or 90d.,
                     <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> currency. Fractions of the Continental dollar were, therefore, expressed on the basis of 90 parts to
                  the dollar. The unit of 90 supported the issuance of fractional paper money in denominations of 1/6, 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 of a Spanish milled
                  dollar which were equivalent respectively to 15d., 30d., 45d., and 60d., <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money of account. An example
                  of this notational system is the expression that French gold coin was valued at $16 68/90 per ounce, etc. In other states, the fractional
                  basis for the Continental dollar would be similarly determined according to the current value of the Spanish milled dollar in the local money
                  of account; <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> and <name type="place">North Carolina</name> calculated fractional dollar values in
                  ninety-sixths, <name type="place">South Carolina</name> and <name type="place">Georgia</name> in fifty-sixths, the <name type="place">New
                     England</name> states and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> in seventy-seconds, and all others in ninetieths. In areas where the the
                  Spanish eight reales was valued at 6s., the currency was called "Proclamation money," "proc." or "Lawful money," since the rate corresponded
                  to the official par, 100:133.33 ratio, sterling to colonial money of account, which was required by the Proclamation of 1704.<ref
                     target="#CH6-n20">20</ref> In colonies where the rate was 7s. 6d., terms used to describe commercial money included "common money," "common
                  currency," "running money," "current money," "currency," and "<name type="place">Pennsyl- <pb n="150"/> vania</name> money."<ref
                     target="#CH6-n21">21</ref> Certainly, independence brought no improvements toward a manageable money system which was further complicated
                  by the authority given to each state under the Articles of Confederation to issue its own currency, even though the decimal basis of 100 was
                  adopted by Congress on July 6, 1785.</p>

               <head>THE ELUSIVE CONTINENTAL DOLLAR</head>
               <p>The Revolutionary War had hardly started before problems with the circulation of counterfeit coppers were brought to public attention. <name
                     type="place">New York</name> newspapers alluded to the potential devaluation of copper and the introduction of a Continental copper
                  currency. <q>We hear it proposed that after 3 months the currency of all copper coin made of base metal or wanting in weight is to be totally
                     suppressed and that the rest is past at the rate of 15 for an eighth part of a dollar. And if it shall appear that there is not a
                     sufficiency for common use, that it will be all called in, and a new impression struck of Continental Copper coin, of a larger size, twelve
                     of which is to pass for an eighth of a dollar, after which no other coppers are to pass current.<ref target="#CH6-n22">22</ref>
                  </q>

               </figure>
               <p>The passage detailed, without attribution of source, a scheme both to "suppress" lightweight counterfeit coppers and to devalue "the rest" to
                  fifteen to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling. Failing satisfactory accomplishment of these goals, then all current coppers would
                  be "called in" for replacement with a new issue. The rumored "Continental Copper coin" described above was to pass at twelve to the <name
                     type="place">New York</name> shilling, or one penny each. This newspaper commentary has been interpreted to imply a connection between the
                  "proposed" Continental copper coin and the well-known Continental Currency which has been considered to be denominated as a dollar. These
                  Continental "dollars" belong to an assemblage of enigmatic early American coinages about which little is known. To date, there have been no
                  clues yet discovered as to the origin of these dollar-sized pieces, the value at which they passed in commerce, and no secure linkage
                  established with the "rumored" penny copper denomination.<ref target="#CH6-n23">23</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As if this <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> report were not perplexing enough by itself, a letter published in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> Gazette</hi> of December 2, 1776, adds more to the confusion.<ref target="#CH6-n24">24</ref> Here it was
                  reported that Congress already was minting copper and silver coins about the size of a half crown; the silver <pb n="151"/> pieces purportedly
                  passed for 12 shillings each and the copper for 14 pence. Little confidence can be placed in the accuracy of this account since neither of
                  these values corresponded to the current exchange rates for copper or silver coins of that size. These two newspaper bulletins provide no
                  assistance in unraveling the mystery of the illusive Continental copper coin or the actual Continental Currency and so numismatic research has
                  had to rely on the examination of the coins themselves and reference to other historical evidence.</p>

                  <p>Fig. 50: <name type="pname">FRANKLIN</name>'S SUNDIAL. The common theme of the sundial motif, first engraved by <name type="pname">Elisha
                        Gallaudet</name> for these fractional currency issues of February 17, 1776, was repeated on the 1776 Continental Dollars and the 1787
                     Fugio coppers (<name type="pname">Newman</name>, <hi rend="italic">Paper Money</hi>, p. 40).</p>
               </figure>
               <p>The design on these Continental dollars was highly influenced by the themes of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</name>. The dies, some of
                  which bear the initials E.G., were the work of <name type="pname">Elisha Gallaudet</name>, who also engraved the plates for the fractional
                  Continental paper emissions of February 17, 1776, using the same motif of the sundial and linked circles.<ref target="#CH6-n25">25</ref> A
                  similar representation was later repeated on the Fugio cents. These dollar-sized coinages are known in seven die combinations and were struck
                  in three different metals. Those in pewter, typically ranging in weight from 244 to 285 grains,<ref target="#CH6-n26">26</ref> are the most
                  common survivors with many hundred known today from an estimated original mintage of 6,000 or more.<ref target="#CH6-n27">27</ref> The motive
                  for the selection of pewter is arcane since this material had no significant intrinsic value although many surviving specimens show obvious

               <p>The emission sequence of the Continental Currency has been studied by <name type="pname">Hodder</name> who demonstrated that all three metals
                  were minted interchangeably indicating that the silver and brass specimens were not preliminary strikes such as trial pieces or patterns would
                  be. Although the brass and silver coins were manufactured randomly during the pewter mintage, there remains the possibility that these rarer
                  issues were presentation pieces or souvenirs. It becomes apparent from these die emission studies, that the Continental dollars were minted in
                  two distinct groups without any connecting die or punch linkages.<ref target="#CH6-n31">31</ref>

               <p>The previously cited letter published from the <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> Gazette</hi> suggested that the copper and silver coins, while of the same size but of different metals,
                  would circulate at different values. If these issues had been struck from the same or similar dies, such an arrangement would have been
                  unsatisfactory because of the potential for tampering. It would not have been long before the unscrupulous would have disguised the copper
                  pieces with a silver or tin wash to pass for silver, particularly with the wartime shortage of specie.</p>
               <p>There is some historical evidence which offers clues as to the origins of the Continental dollars. When the Continental Congress authorized
                  paper currency, the one dollar denomination was included only in the first four issues through May 6, 1776. Thereafter, the dollar note was
                  omitted from the next six emissions to be resumed in the final series of January 14, 1779. The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> bills of
                  credit authorized August 13, 1776, similarly omitted the dollar unit but included four lower fractional denominations from $1/16 to $1/2 and
                  then continued from $2 to $10.<ref target="#CH6-n32">32</ref> In his pioneering study of this coinage, <name type="pname">Newman</name>
                  concludes that this exclusion of the dollar note in these several paper currency emissions was purposeful since it was Congress's intent that
                  this slot be filled with a minted coinage. "The $1 note would be most convenient for circulation and would be one of the last denominations to
                  be eliminated unless a substitute [e.g. Continental dollar] was intended." Inflation had not progressed to the point that the dollar
                  denomination would have been unprofitable to print.<ref target="#CH6-n33">33</ref> It can be speculated that the pewter Continental dollar was
                  a fiat metallic currency intended to circulate in conjunction with the higher denominational Continental paper money, the intent of the brass
                  and silver issues being yet undiscovered. It is highly improbable that the "Continental Copper coin" described in the newspaper account
                  relates to the Continental dollar. In the middle of a war with so many more vital matters to consider, the Continental Congress would not have
                  expended so much energy on a large copper coin "to circulate as basic small change," but it would have been appropriate to help strengthen the
                  paper currency with a specie coinage. If this money had been intended as a copper coinage, why are there no specimens in that metal and why
                  are there pieces in silver? The floreated edges found on some of these varieties would be an unreasonable garnish for a copper coinage but
                  appropriate to protect silver currency.<ref target="#CH6-n34">34</ref> Numismatists can hope that some documentary evidence will be uncovered

                  <head>The Problems of Peace</head>
                  <p>On October 19, 1781, <name type="pname">Cornwallis</name> surrendered to <name type="place">Washington</name> at <name type="place"
                        >Yorktown</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>, ending the war. The question was whether these "thirteen commonwealths bound in a
                     league of friendship" would emerge as one nation or thirteen. A preliminary peace treaty was signed on <pb n="153"/> January 20, 1783, in
                        <name type="place">Paris</name>. Provisions of this treaty dealt with boundaries, fishing rights, and the more difficult issues of
                     confiscated Tory holdings and the satisfaction of private debts incurred with <name type="place">England</name> prior to the hostilities.
                     Congress claimed it had no jurisdiction over the Loyalist properties and that the issue should be settled at the state level. The treaty
                     confirmed that the private debts were still binding and should be discharged at full value although the states did not enforce this
                        arrangement.<ref target="#CH6-n35">35</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The war debt became an overwhelming issue. Congress was saddled with $200,000,000 in bills of credit. Since only the states could levy
                     taxes. Congress was at their mercy for funds to retire this Continental currency and the state legislatures showed no enthusiasm to raise
                     money for this purpose. Large accounts were still outstanding for war supplies and food requisitioned from civilian merchants; the armed
                     forces had gone unpaid. In 1776, at a time when the American cause looked bleakest, the military officers had demanded from Congress half
                     pay for life after the war was over, and common soldiers were granted an $80 bounty if they agreed to serve until the peace.<ref
                        target="#CH6-n36">36</ref> The army had been paid in depreciated money and "... four month's pay of a private soldier would not procure
                     for his family a single bushel of wheat; the pay of a colonel would not purchase oats for his horse ...." Some states demonstrated a
                     genuine concern for the physical comfort and welfare of their militias and "undertook to make good to their troops the loss in pay caused
                     by the depreciation of the currency," whereas others "left theirs troops almost destitute."<ref target="#CH6-n37">37</ref> Now, in 1781,
                     the hostilities were over and the chief legacy from the war was hard-won freedom, a large war debt, unpaid and disquieted troops, and much
                     worthless paper money.</p>
                  <p>It was evident that the Articles of Confederation were powerless to cope with such a situation. Congress needed to raise money
                     independently of the several state legislatures. Leaders of the day recognized the need for a strong central government to contend with
                     this economic crisis. In 1780, even before the war was over, when the army had become so desperate and discontented, it was proposed in
                     Congress that General <name type="place">Washington</name> be given dictatorial powers to deal with the dilemma.<ref target="#CH6-n38"

                  </p>
                  <p>Immediately following the war, hard money became plentiful from the specie which had been spent in the occupied territories by the now
                     departed foreign troops.<ref target="#CH6-n41">41</ref> It has been calculated that the French armies placed about 35,000,000 livres (about

                     ¬£10,000,000. These enormous sums of hard money caused an unprecedented, yet short-lived, prosperity in the postwar era. More wealth entered
                     circulation from confiscated Loyalist holdings and from proceeds recovered from privateering against English shipping. This abundance was
                     only temporary since the hard currency was soon exported to <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place">Europe</name> in
                     exchange for manufactured goods and luxuries which had been in short supply during the Revolution. The country had gone on a buying spree

                  <p>Typical of the paper money controversy was <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>, a state which itself was bankrupt during the year 1781
                     to 1782. The state was mired in a terrible postwar depression, and while the economy was based on specie, none was available. Most farmers
                     lived at a subsistence level but had no hard money for taxes and so personal bankruptcies and foreclosures were rampant. The state had
                     nothing to sell abroad since ship building was at a standstill and, therefore, it had no way to earn hard money. Other parts of the country
                     fared better, such as <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, where "silver and gold is plenty" because of earned foreign credits from the
                     export of flour. To alleviate the money shortage and provide means for retiring public and private debts, it was advocated in <name
                        type="place">New Hampshire</name> in 1786 to issue paper currency by a land bank. Some critics of the proposal "were opposed to a paper
                     currency backed by land because their debts to English merchants had to be paid in specie and consequently little use could be made of
                     forfeited land."<ref target="#CH6-n55">55</ref> The <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> legislature resisted the paper money plan,
                     perhaps apprehensive because of the riotous behavior of some paper money supporters who demonstrated violently during September 1786, in
                     Exeter, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>, and "raised a cry for paper-money, and equal distribution of property, and a release from
                        debts."<ref target="#CH6-n56">56</ref> Riots also occurred in neighboring <name type="place">Vermont</name> at <name type="place"

                  </p>
                  <p>The <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> legislature also withstood the excitation for paper money despite the fact that there was an
                     average debt of $50 per person, arising from private debts, the war debt, back pay for soldiers, and the current expense for running the
                     government. The situation was further compounded by the requirement that taxes be paid in hard money, which particularly injured the
                     farmers who protested the fact that they fought in the Revolution, were either unpaid or paid in valueless money, and now were forced to
                     produce hard currency for taxes or face foreclosure or debtors' prison. Their resistance to authority led to a confrontation with the state
                     militia in an encounter called "Shays's Rebellion."<ref target="#CH6-n58">58</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Significant problems existed as well with hard currency during the Confederation period. While paper money was subjected to devaluation and
                     counterfeiting, hard coin currency itself could fall victim to tampering, debasement, and devaluation. Such mutilated and debased coins
                     also tended to drive sound, full-valued coins out of circulation, making unclipped silver and gold pieces rarities. In his reminiscences of
                     the Revolutionary period, <name type="pname">E.S. Thomas</name> recalled that as his family fled their home in the face of advancing
                     English troops, his mother risked running back into the building to fetch a small bag of coins since money was so scarce at that time.<ref

                     <q>During the period of the Confederation the chaotic state of the currency was a serious obstacle to trade, and it offered endless
                        opportunities for fraud and extortion. Clipping and counterfeiting were carried to such lengths that every moderately cautious person,
                        in taking payment in hard cash, felt it necessary to keep a small pair of scales beside him and carefully weigh each coin after narrowly
                        scrutinizing its stamp and deciphering its legend.<ref target="#CH6-n60">60</ref>

                  </p>
                  <p>Clipping of coins was not limited to the private sector. In 1782, when the United <name type="place">States government</name> had received
                     a quantity of French guineas as part of a loan, the coins were clipped by treasury officials before being placed into circulation with the
                     rationalization that if the government did not clip them, the first people who received the intact coin would certainly do so, therefore
                     any derived profit should accrue to the public benefit.<ref target="#CH6-n61">61</ref>

                  <p>Following the war, lightweight counterfeit English halfpence again flowed into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> with large numbers
                     arriving with every ship from <name type="place">England</name>, imported as consignments of "hardware." A 1781 proclamation from the <name

                        >62</ref> Specific allegations against the counterfeit halfpence are stated in the following memorandum: <q>The coinage of copper is a
                        subject that claims our immediate attention. From the small value of the several pieces of copper coin, this medium of exchange has been
                        too much neglected. The more valuable metals are daily giving place to base British half-pence, and no means are used to prevent the
                        fraud. This disease, which is neglected in the beginning because it appears trifling, may finally prove very destructive to commerce. It
                        is admitted that copper may, at this instant be purchased in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> at one-eighth of a dollar the pound.</q>
                     <q>British half-pence, made at the tower, are forty-eight to the pound. Those manufactured at <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, and
                        shipped in thousands for our use, are much lighter, and they are of base metal. It can hardly be said that seventy-two of them are worth
                        a pound of copper; hence it will follow, that we give for British half-pence about six times their value. There are no materials from
                        which we can estimate the weight of half-pence, that have been imported from <name type="place">Britain</name> since the late war, but
                        we have heard of sundry shipments being ordered, to the nominal amount of one thousand guineas; and we are told that no packet arrives
                        from <name type="place">England</name> without some hundred weight of base half-pence. It is a very moderate computation which states
                        our loss, on the last twelve months, at 30,000 dollars, by the commerce of vile coin.<ref target="#CH6-n63">63</ref>

                  <p>The preceeding statement, by an unknown author, was not only descriptive of the troubled copper medium, but also prophetic. It asserted
                     that the invasion of the small change currency by counterfeit English coppers, while seemingly non-threatening in the beginning, was not
                     only <pb n="157"/> driving small silver denominations out of circulation, but also had the potential to inflict injury on commerce itself.
                     By 1789 these predictions all came true.</p>

                  <p>Such was the turbulent scene of the 1780s: a severe depression with struggling commerce, a practically worthless paper money, a shortage of

                        were bits, and half bits, pistareens, picayunes, and fips. Of gold pieces there were johannes, or joe, the dubloon [doubloon], the

                  </p>
                  <p>On July 6, 1785, Congress passed a resolution regarding the money units of the <name type="place">United States</name> and the content
                        thereof.<ref target="#CH6-n65">65</ref> The proposed coins were to be in a decimal ratio starting with the half cent and cent of copper,
                     a dime, double-dime, half dollar, and dollar in silver, and in gold, a half eagle of five dollars and eagle of ten dollars. Despite this
                     effort to achieve some conformity in the monetary system, the states still calculated in their old monies of account. An attempt to
                     reconcile these several schemes is exemplified in the chart written by <name type="pname">Nicholas Pike</name> in 1786 and published in
                     1788 which is reproduced as Table 17.<ref target="#CH6-n66">66</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the above table, in the far left column, was the Spanish American milled dollar. It is represented here as a whole unit and also in its
                     fractional parts, all of which actually existed as circulating coins. Of these, the 1/16th dollar was the half-real or picayune, the 1/8th
                     the real, the quarter dollar the two reales, and the half dollar the four reales. The 1/9th of a dollar was only an imaginary money of
                     account, but it was a very convenient denomination in which to calculate in view of the fact that the value of the Spanish milled dollar in
                     local monies for the <name type="place">New England</name> and <name type="place">Middle Atlantic</name> states was 72d. and 90d.,
                     respectively. The two Spanish coins tabulated were the half pistareen, conforming quite well to the newly proposed dime, and the full
                     pistareen which was nearly identical in assay to the "double" dime. The content of .925 fine standard in the "head" pistareen minted in
                        <name type="place">Spain</name> after 1772 was 80.9 grains (see Table 5) whereas the "double" dime was proposed at 81.8 grains. Nothing
                     ever came of the "double" dime proposition until many years later when for four years, 1875 to 1878, a twenty cent piece was minted.<ref

                  </p>
                  <p>If we assume that the other monies enumerated in <name type="pname">Pike</name>'s table were the common coins of 1786, then the other
                     silver coins of the period were generally English and French, and the gold coins were French and English guineas, the Portuguese moidore
                     and "half-joes," and Spanish pistoles and doubloons.</p>
                  <p>It was soon apparent that the Articles of Confederation were ill-equipped to meet the problems and challenges of the new nation. The final
                     solution for these dilemmas was the establishment of the Constitution of 1787.</p>
                  <p>From a numismatic perspective we must pause and describe some very significant events which occurred from 1785 to 1789. While the country
                     was still in the grips of a severe postwar depression and hard money shortage, the circulating copper currency, the money of the poor, was
                     also in motley disarray and chaos. The prevalent copper money of the period, English halfpence and farthings, was diluted with large
                     quantities of lightweight counterfeits of impure <pb n="159"/> copper.<ref target="#CH6-n68">68</ref> The legal coppers at best were
                     themselves a token coinage passing at about double their intrinsic value. The introduction of lightweight and false coppers undermined
                     public confidence in this medium. In an attempt to rid commerce of these illegal coppers which eroded the economy and caused financial
                     damage especially to the poor who could afford it least, various states authorized projects under the authority of the Articles of
                     Confederation to mint domestic copper coinage which would provide a stable currency. The next chapter, "Coinage of the Confederation
                     Period," details this experience.</p>

                        reales passed at 72d. A "fip" or fivepenny bit is another accounting for the half real. Hence, the medio, half real, half bit, picayune,
                        fip, fippenny, fippence, and fourpence ha'-penny, were all terms for the same coin. See Table 4. The <name type="place">Carolin</name>,

               <lb/> Coinage of the Confederation Period</head>
            <p>The scarcity of silver and gold coins during the serious post war depression of the 1780s has been discussed in prior chapters. In contrast, the
               small change copper medium of the colonies was polluted by an abundance of lightweight counterfeit English halfpence. Several state legislatures
               attempted to curb the economic injury caused by this unrestricted volume of counterfeit coppers, since it was perceived that these false coins
               were inflicting financial damage especially on the poorer, working classes. In 1781, the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> legislature
               issued a decree recommending "all faithfull [sic] inhabitants of this State to refuse it [counterfeit British halfpence] in payment, and by all
               other lawful ways and means discourage the currency thereof ...."<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> A more definitive course was adopted by <name
                  type="place">Vermont</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> in 1785, <name type="place">New Jersey</name> in 1786, and <name
                  type="place">Massachusetts</name> in 1787, when these four jurisdictions authorized mints for the purpose of replacing these spurious coppers
               with high grade, pure copper coinages on the theory that these new coppers would be received preferentially and thus drive the lightweight
               imports out of circulation. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> adopted a different strategem in 1787. Rather than to mint its own copper
               currency, it strove to regulate the circulation of existing coins by demonetizing all coppers less than 145.8 grains and devaluing all others
               from 14 to 20 per local shilling. The coinages of these Confederation mints is the subject of this present chapter.</p>

               <head>COINING TECHNOLOGY DURING THE CONFEDERATION</head>
               <p>The state coinages of the Confederation period are a fascinating series. While much is known about them and the circumstances of their
                  manufacture, significantly more remains undiscovered. Many of the actual coins themselves reside today in the cabinets of individual
                  numismatists and in museum collections, but none of the punches, dies, presses or other hardware used in the minting process is reported to
                  have survived.<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> The information we have is derived from examination of the coins themselves and existing
                  historical records such as legal proceedings, contracts, legislative debate and enactments, newspaper accounts, and sundry other contemporary
                  documents. A large number of coppers from this period are "orphans" in that nothing is recorded about their provenance.</p>
               <p>A great deal of information has been preserved regarding eighteenth century English mints,<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref> but it is unwise and
                  inaccurate to apply these facts uncritically to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. <name type="pname">Spilman</name> has studied the
                  technology of coining used in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> during this period.<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref> He qualifies his conclusions
                  about colonial minting practices since they were based on visual observations and recognizes the need for firmer laboratory evidence. The
                  major technical problem confronting the Confederation mintmaster was the inability to produce and roll planchet stock to uniform dimension.
                  Many inherent technical problems can be envisioned in this rudimentary rolling process, including the ambient temperature, and the alignment,
                  compliance, and resiliance of the iron rollers. For example, a decrease in roller spacing from 1.71 to 1.61 millimeters could reduce the final
                  weight of a <name type="place">Connecticut</name> copper, 28 millimeters in diameter, from the authorized 144.0 to 135.3 grains.<ref

                     <p>Fig. 52: <name type="pname">SAMUEL THOMPSON</name>'S ROLLING MILL (1783). This illustration is from the <name type="pname"
                           >Thompson</name> manuscript in the ANS Library showing the process for rolling metal fillets from which to cut planchets. The power
                        source could be either from a horse or water wheel. The thickness of the strip could be controlled by the space between the rollers
                        adjusted by the set screws "E" and "F". <name type="pname">Thompson</name>, working in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, equipped his
                        machine with "polished steel rollers" whereas those in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> were probably rough cast iron with surface
                        irregularities which flawed the planchets. These roller marks are visible on certain finished coins.</p>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="163"/> Residual striations impressed on the surfaces of copper fillets by the rough surfaces of the cast iron rollers are commonly seen
                  on finished <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coins when the planchets were insufficiently annealed, or softened, prior to striking.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n6">6</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Crosby</name> relates how planchets for <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> coppers were cast into ingots at the <name
                     type="place">Boston</name> mint and then carted to nearby <name type="place">Dedham</name> where the copper "was drawn under a trip-hammer,
                  and rolled into sheets, when it was returned to the mint, where the blanks were prepared and the coin stamped."<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref>
                  The rolling procedure practiced in <name type="place">England</name> was more complex where the fillets were initially prepared in a horse or
                  water powered "roughing mill," and then passed through a power driven "finishing mill" prior to being brought to exact dimensions by passage
                  through a set of polished, hardened, steel rollers on a hand operated "drag-bench."<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Given this imperfect techology in rolling copper fillets to the proper thickness, there is little wonder that the coppers of the late
                  eighteenth century were so variable in weight. In Chapter Eight there is an extensive gravimetric analysis of the Confederation coinages.
                  While most of these issues conform reasonably to a bell curve, indicating a normal distribution above and below the average, the question is
                  raised as to what allowable tolerances in coin weights should be permitted these early American mintmasters in view of their imprecise
                  machinery. Since the Tower Mint, with its more sophisticated equipment, sanctioned tolerances per pound of 2.5% for <name type="pname">George
                     II</name> halfpence<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref> and 3.33% for the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence,<ref target="#CH7-n10"
                     >10</ref> a 5% remedy for Confederation mints appears to be a reasonable expectation.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref> Any value within these
                  limits of error should not raise the suspicion of impropriety on part of the mintmaster, but only confirms his frustration with his primitive
                  equipment.</p>
               <p>The source of the copper used in the Confederation mints is uncertain except in some specific instances. This subject will be covered more
                  fully in the following chapter where the costs of coining are examined fully. All planchets of American manufacture appear to have been
                  fashioned from the same style of planchet cutter. <name type="pname">Spilman</name> describes this device as "two telescoping cookie cutters,"
                  not unlike a pair of circular scissors which could be resharpened. The cleavage plane around the circumference of planchets cut by this
                  technique formed a rounded edge. Contemporary English planchets were punched from strips in a screw press forced through a single cutting
                  surface which resulted in a straight, sharp rim. These planchets were bent by this process and required passage through a second machine which
                  then flattened them.<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref> The rolling and cutting of the planchets caused the metal to become work-hardened by the
                  applied stress. The metal then required softening, or annealing, by heating in furnaces prior to coining in order to restore its former
                     malleability.<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> If flans were not annealed and remained hard, the impression was not as clear and the dies
                  wore rapidly, showing signs of early failure. It is unknown if American mints consistently annealed their planchets except from circumstantial
                  evidence which will be cited in specific instances.</p>
               <p>Because there are no known dies of Confederation coppers, most information is inferred from examination of the actual coins. The process of
                  die manufacture in the late eighteenth century has been summarized by <name type="pname">Chard</name> with particular emphasis on the
                  metallurgical aspects.<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> Working, or embossing dies for these coppers were constructed from cylindrical shaped
                  bars of steel with one end milled to the circumference of the desired coin. This end was then annealed to a softened state and the design for
                  the intended coin was impressed into the smooth face of the <pb n="164"/> die with a series of punches or hubs. After each step of the
                  process, the die would become work-hardened requiring further softening lest it become brittle and fracture producing premature die
                  failure.</p>
               <p>The completed die and the embossing punches and hubs were mirror images of the final design on the struck coin, the die being a negative and
                  the finished coin a positive representation. The central effigies frequently were sunk into the face of the die by a hub on whose surface the
                  desired design previously had been engraved, or impressed from a master matrix, and the hub then hardened. This transfer was usually
                  accomplished by a screw press due to the required force.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref> This central hub, or puncheon, then could be used
                  again thus imparting identical patterns on several embossing dies. The other alternative was for the central figures to be engraved directly
                  onto a single die. The legends, dates, and other ornamentation were added to the die with individual punches, or tools. There are instances in
                  the 1785 and 1780 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series where the entire detail of the coin was raised on complex hubs so the complete
                  obverse and reverse features could be sunk into the working die, with all subsequent dies from the same complex hub being exact copies. In
                  this process, to be described later, some of the completed features required hand strengthening with punches.</p>

                  <p>Fig. 53(a-b): 1787 "Horned Bust": This contemporary counterfeit from dies attributed to <name type="pname">Walter Mould</name>, may be the
                     most common <name type="place">Connecticut</name> copper. 1787 <name type="pname">Miller</name> 4-L. (a) The first specimen (139.4 grains)
                     is from an earlier die state just as a break appeared in the obverse field under the figure's chin. As the break enlarged, the engraver
                     attempted to repair the damage by grinding down, or lapping, the obverse field. As the height of the field was reduced, the more shallowly
                     engraved curls behind the neck lost relief and became indistinct. (b) The second specimen (105.1 grains) demonstrates the poorer detail of
                     the lower hairline and the well-developed break which appears to project as a horn from the figure's armor (Table 21, no. 13a; Chart
                     24).</p>
               </figure>
               <p>The letter and number punches were in the form of miniature, wedge-shaped chisels with sharpened edges such that their imprint could be
                  hammered into the face of the die. The deeper the punch was sunk into the surface of the die, the deeper the resulting impression, and due to
                  the wedge-shaped characteristic of the punch, the wider the positive shape of the letter appeared on the struck coin. If the punches were
                  unevenly cut into the die, then the final positive image on the struck coin would be uneven. As the die wore from use or the field was
                  purposely ground, or lapped, the less deeply sunk portion of the letter might become less clear or even disappear. <pb n="165"/>

                     <p>Fig. 54: <name type="pname">SAMUEL THOMPSON</name>'S COINAGE PRESS (1783). This screw press, or "fly" from <name type="pname"
                           >Thompson</name>'s manuscript, is probably the style of press that was in general operation during the Confederation period. <name

                  </figure>
                  <pb n="166"/> This phenomenon is well illustrated on the 1787 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> Muttonhead where the reworked die had so
                  much metal ground from the surface of the field that several letters became indistinct while others, which were not as deeply impressed in the
                  original die, were completely obliterated.<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref> Due to flaws originating around included impurities in the steel,
                  cracks could appear on the surface of the die usually connecting with some element of the engraved design producing the familiar die break. By
                  grinding down the face of the die, such acquired defects could be eradicated but they were usually ignored. In the engraver's attempt to
                  repair the die break which originated in the left obverse field on the famous 1787 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> Horned Bust, <name
                     type="pname">Miller</name> 4-L, variety, so much of the surface was ground away that the more shallow curl detail down the back of the neck
                  was eliminated as the height of the field was reduced (see <ref target="#fig-106">fig. 53</ref>).<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref> If a die were
                  improperly case hardened, after repeated use its weakened center might start to sink in a concave fashion, imparting as a mirror image on the
                  struck coin a convex contour within the central field. This central bulging is particularly obvious on some large planchet <name type="place"
                     >New Jersey</name> varieties.</p>
               <p>It is universally held that a screw press operated by two opposing fly weights on the end of a long arm was used in all instances for minting
                  Confederation coppers. From the location of edge pinch defects on coins when the machine malfunctioned, it appears that the press used for the
                     <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and Fugio series by <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name> even possessed an automatic planchet feeder.
                  A typical coining press at the Tower Mint was described as: <q>two horizontal arms, each loaded with a hundredweight of lead at its tip ... As
                     a Moneyer inserted a blank between the two dies through an aperture in the foot of the press, four laborers pulled the arms violently; the
                     capstan spun, ... and ... as it crashed down [it] drove the die in its base against the blank and the latter against the nether die. These
                     great machines could strike nearly a coin every two seconds‚Äîaccording to <name type="pname">Newton</name>; the Moneyers put the average
                     stroke at three a minute‚Äîbut the strain was so great that the labourers could only keep up work for fifteen minutes at a time. And few
                     Moneyers were nimble enough to save their fingers indefinitely.<ref target="#CH7-n18">18</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>All of the American coppers were struck without collars resulting in some radial expansion of the planchet during the procedure. This is
                  particularly evident on multiply struck coins which have significantly greater diameters by one to two millimeters.<ref target="#CH7-n19"
                     >19</ref>
               </p>
               <p>History has remained silent on another important aspect of the Confederation coinages concerning the mechanism for the distribution of newly
                  minted coppers. There must have been some scheme by which the mintmaster placed this money into circulation considering there were no banks or
                  other financial institutions which could assume this role. For the legal operations, a percentage of the coppers was paid into the treasury as
                  the required royalty and the disposal of these coins became the problem of the state. It is probable that other coins were sold in bulk at
                  discount rates to middlemen who acted as "utterers" who then entered them into commerce. It is unlikely that merchants would have welcomed any
                  large quantity of coppers, at any price, unless they had means to pass them on in order that they not be encumbered with large numbers of
                  unwanted coins. The requirement to dispose of coppers at wholesale prices would have diminished any potential profits to the minters. The only
                  published reference regarding the dispersion of any actual coppers is contained in the account of Royal Flint and the Fugios.</p>
               <p>Many individuals were connected with the Confederation coinages as investors, mintmasters, engravers, and die sinkers. For some, their
                  connection with a particular mint is clear and definite, whereas for others, due to lack of records, their precise involvement still remains
                  shroud- <pb n="167"/> ed in conjecture. There have been attempts to identify the artisans who engraved particular dies through study of the
                  letter and number punches, style, and hubs. Whenever it is believed that the product of a certain engraver is recognized, it has become
                  appealing to assign all similar work to the same individual through this punch-link evidence. Using this approach, a large number of
                  Confederation coppers have been attributed to particular men, <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name> being noteworthy in this regard. While
                  existing contracts confirm that <name type="pname">Atlee</name> played an important role in certain coinages, his precise function is
                  undocumented, except in the latter day recollection of <name type="pname">Thomas N. Machin</name>, son of the famous mintmaster, who referred
                  to him as "<name type="pname">Atlee</name>, the engraver ...."<ref target="#CH7-n20">20</ref>
               </p>
               <p>If the sharp cutting edge of a punch were broken, the damage could be so characteristic that the so-called "broken letter punch" could be
                  followed through all the dies on which it was used. Broken "A," "N," and "P" letter punches were identified by <name type="pname"
                     >Crosby</name> and subsequently attributed to <name type="pname">Atlee</name> who is assumed to have been the responsible engraver.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n21">21</ref> Whenever these and other telltale marks and stylistic similarities appear, the die and related coinages have
                  been attributed to <name type="pname">Atlee</name> through this punch-link evidence. <name type="pname">Hodder</name> has demonstrated, by
                  photographic enlargement rather than reliance on naked eye examination, that several "broken A" punches can be identified and so the trail of
                  this defective letter does not necessarily lead to <name type="pname">Atlee</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n22">22</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Crosby</name> remarked on what he assumed to be the recurrence of identical letter punches and considered "it certain that
                  many of the dies of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name>, and some of the AUCTORI CONNEC were the work
                  of the same artist; but whether the dies for the different mints were made at one place, or whether the artist followed an itinerant practice,
                  and visited the mints as occasion required, which probably would be the more convenient method of conducting his business ... must be left to
                     conjecture."<ref target="#CH7-n23">23</ref> The imitation British halfpence from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> have also been
                  attributed to <name type="pname">Atlee</name> on the strength of the same type of evidence.<ref target="#CH7-n24">24</ref> While the use of
                  identical punches on many coinages may be fact, nothing tells us whose hand used the punches. Could more than one punch, made from a common
                  letter punch matrix, have been used by several engravers in their own individual work? There is no proof that each engraver fabricated his own
                  tools and did not procure them from some common source. It is reasonable to speculate that with the volume of minting activity centered in
                     <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, there would have been some commercial supply of punches available to American artisans. While it is
                  certain that many dies are related by punch-link evidence, it remains speculative to link all similar work to one particular artisan without
                  supporting documentary evidence. The material in this chapter covers the whole spectrum of hypothesis ranging from fact to opinion. But until
                  the Rosetta Stone is uncovered which can unravel the unsolved mysteries relative to the minting and circulation of these coppers, research
                  continues in the hope that our current concepts about Confederation coppers will be expanded, supported and/or refuted. In the meanwhile, it
                  is vital to remain objective in our interpretation of the available information and not look for facts where there are none.</p>

                  <name type="place">CONNECTICUT</name> COPPERS</head>
               <p>Since <name type="place">Vermont</name> was outside the Confederation, <name type="place">Connecticut</name> was actually the first state to
                  introduce a legitimate, full weight, copper currency designed to suppress circulation and acceptance of these counterfeit English coppers.
                  This coinage was launched in response to the petition by the business association of <name type="pname">Samuel Bishop</name>, <name
                     type="pname">James Hillhouse</name>, <name type="pname">John Goodrich</name>, and <name type="pname">Joseph Hopkins</name> to the <name
                     type="place">Connecticut</name> legislature on October 18, 1785, for a franchise to mint state <pb n="168"/> coppers under the authority of
                  the Confederation, which permitted both federal and state mints. Two days later, the legislature granted this partnership, the Company for
                  Coining Coppers, approval to mint coppers for a period not exceeding five years. It further stipulated that the coins weigh 144 grains each,
                  or 46 to the pound, that a five percent royalty be paid to the State Treasury, and that the coppers were not legal tender.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n25">25</ref> Besides the legally sanctioned organization, at least six or possibly seven other mints participated in
                  manufacturing <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers over a span of four or five years, although in some instances these different
                  "mints" were just a business reorganization or realignment of previous shareholders.<ref target="#CH7-n26">26</ref> The classification method
                  by <name type="pname">Henry C. Miller</name>, first published in 1920 and subsequently enlarged by others, is the accepted designation with
                  some 355 different die varieties or combinations currently identified.<ref target="#CH7-n27">27</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Miller</name>'s system has its inadequacies since it considers only the punctuation and devices in the legends rather than
                  the more obvious bust styles that better identify coins of similar mint and engraver. It is thought that the legend ornamentation contains
                  some as yet undeciphered code indicating the circumstances of manufacture or the identity of the diesinker.<ref target="#CH7-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>All <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers have the same basic motif, with an obverse bust either draped in a toga or clad in mail,
                  facing left or right in the pose of <name type="pname">George II</name> or <name type="pname">George III</name>, respectively, and the
                  abbreviated legends, AUCTORI CONNEC, "By the Authority of the State of <name type="place">Connecticut</name>," or some variation thereof. The
                  reverse design is a Britannia-like figure with the peripheral inscription, INDE ET LIB, "Independence and Liberty," rarely ET LIB INDE, or a
                  modified abbreviation of INDE as IND. This new coinage was purposely modeled after the already familiar British halfpenny on the assumption
                  that the population would be more inclined to accept in commerce a coin similar to those well known to them for years.</p>
               <p>Among the 355 different die combinations, there are 145 varietal types listed in <name type="pname">Breen</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Complete
                     Encyclopedia of <name type="place">U.S.</name> and Colonial Coins</hi>, and about 26 distinct bust styles. An attempt has been made to
                  identify these coppers as to engraver and mint. During the first year, the engraver and diesinker for those pieces from the Company for
                  Coining Coppers was <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name>, a man of many skills and accomplishments, about whom much documentary evidence
                     exists.<ref target="#CH7-n29">29</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Buell</name> produced the 1785 bust right copper by using a common obverse head puncheon and a common reverse seated figure
                  puncheon to impress the dies and then strengthened the impressions by hand and then added the legends using individual letter punches.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n30">30</ref> A few of the 1785 Mailed Bust Right coins vary from <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s style, notably the
                  "African Heads" and those related by common letter punches, suggesting either a different engraver with his own set of tools, or the
                  possibility of a second mint entirely. <name type="pname">Buell</name>, described by his biographer as "an uncommonly ingenious mechanic,"
                  next began to make dies for the 1786 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series by impressing them from a common hub, employing a technology
                  fully 50 years before its time in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. The Mailed Bust Left coins dated 1785 and 1786 were manufactured by this

               <p>At the same time there was a distinct departure in obverse design on <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers. On most 1785 issues, the
                  bust faced to the right, similar to the motif for <name type="pname">George III</name> coppers. Starting with <name type="pname"
                  >Buell</name>'s 1785 and 1786 dies impressed from a common hub, the style changed and the obverse mailed bust now faced to the left,
                  reminiscent of <name type="pname">George II</name> halfpence since on English coins the bust orientation alternates with each succeeding
                  monarch. The reason for this variation is unclear but it has been suggested that the shift in bust presentation was <name type="pname"
                     >Buell</name>'s attempt to enable the public to distinguish between his legitimate <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers and a
                  flood of contemporaneous, counterfeit, 1786-dated, Mailed Bust Right coppers, of an entirely different style, recently placed in circulation
                  from a yet unidentified source.<ref target="#CH7-n31">31</ref> It is just as reasonable to speculate that <name type="pname">Buell</name> made
                  this change in bust direction, now to the left, to assist a largely illiterate population to discriminate between <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> coppers as a group, and the very large number of bust right counterfeit <name type="pname">George III</name> British
                  coppers which was the predominate small change currency. Of interest, the bust left orientation continued on all of <name type="pname"
                     >Buell</name>'s subsequent dies. The obverse bust faced right again only on some other rare contemporary counterfeits, on the Muttonheads,
                  and on those issues dated 1787 and 1788, thought to be from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> since they possess characteristics
                  linking them to imitation <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence.</p>
               <p>The appearance of these six 1786-dated Mailed Bust Right counterfeit varieties may have been the stimulus for subsequent legislative action in
                  October 1785, prohibiting the manufacture of "Copper Coin" without permission of the General Assembly. In May of the following year, an act
                  was proposed forbidding the importation into <name type="place">Connecticut</name> of more than 50 coppers except those "coined &amp; put
                  forth by the Authority of Congress or some of the united [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] States and of equal Value with the Copper coined in this
                  State by lawful authority." This reference also has been interpreted as a recommended action against the introduction and circulation of
                  spurious 1786-dated <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers into the state.<ref target="#CH7-n32">32</ref>

               <p>There has been an attempt to attribute the above discussed counterfeit 1786-dated <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers by punch link
                  evidence to <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name> as previously narrated. Little is recorded about <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name>

                  partnership, of which they were both members.<ref target="#CH7-n34">34</ref> In the contract of April 18, 1787, and in a subsequent agreement

                  traditionally assigned to him.<ref target="#CH7-n38">38</ref> Further research into <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name>'s career may
                  settle this nagging historical question.</p>
               <p>Several punches, notable for their identifiable flaws and characteristics, have been traced through the dies for several different series of
                  Confederation coppers as previously described, but there is nothing to confirm where or by whom the engraving was actually done. <name
                     type="pname">Crosby</name> thought that the die cutter responsible for these common punches was "itinerant," going from place to place as
                  work was requested.<ref target="#CH7-n39">39</ref> Based on his association with <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> and the <name
                     type="place">Rupert</name> mint, in the evidence just cited, <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name> is considered by many to be the
                  artisan responsible for the group of spurious 1786-dated <name type="place">Connecticuts</name> and related coinages. The belief is expanded
                  further, also on the basis of punch-link evidence, to suggest that he was also employed for about eight months as the engraver at the <name
                     type="place">Rahway</name>, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, mint of <name type="pname">Goadsby</name> and <name type="pname"
                     >Cox</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n40">40</ref> Although the hypothesis is possible, all that is certain is that the group of 1786 <name
                     type="place">Connecticuts</name> shares common punches with selected <name type="place">New Jersey</name> and other coppers, there being no
                  evidence to verify where or by whom the dies were cut or under whose auspices they were struck. In any case, this group of spurious 1786 <name
                     type="place">Connecticuts</name> could be minted at a greater profit than available to <name type="pname">Buell</name>, since a
                  counterfeiting operation owed no royalties to any authority and was not bound to any weight specifications. The <name type="place"
                     >Birmingham</name> experience was now being reenacted in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> since there was considerable profit to be made
                  at little risk.</p>
               <p>In addition to the six unauthorized varieties, three other very primitive and rare 1786 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> varieties are
                  known. These <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers are so crude in execution that it is doubtful that they would have inspired much
                  credibility as a legitimate coin except with the illiterate and unsophisticated.<ref target="#CH7-n41">41</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Although first inspection of the "Hercules Head" of 1786 and 1787, probably minted by the Company for Coining Coppers, suggests a totally
                  different style, it is actually a standard Mailed Bust Left design of 1785 and 1786 which had been significantly recut to produce the scowling
                  face, thick neck, and rectangular chin of this familiar piece.<ref target="#CH7-n42">42</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A new Draped Bust Left copper appeared in 1786 from dies also prepared by <name type="pname">Buell</name>. <name type="pname">Breen</name>
                  surmised that this new design was introduced when business arrangements for the Company for Coining Coppers were modified and their equipment
                  was leased for seven weeks beginning September 10, 1786, to <name type="pname">Mark Leavenworth</name>, <name type="pname">Isaac
                     Baldwin</name>, and <name type="pname">William Leavenworth</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n43">43</ref> This was the first use of the Draped Bust
                  Left motif; the varieties dated 1786 are rare, whereas the later 1787 Draped Left issues are by far the most common of all <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> coppers. Following <pb n="175"/> introduction of the Draped Bust Left design, this type was then minted by the Company
                  for Coining Coppers for the remainder of 1786 and until June 1, 1787. On this date the business dissolved and the operation passed into the
                  hands of <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company, which included some of the previous partners, who reorganized the firm to mint Fugio
                  coppers under a Federal contract. The principal in this organization, <name type="pname">James Jarvis</name>, was a well known figure and much
                  is known about his career.<ref target="#CH7-n44">44</ref> This new enterprise continued to mint <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers
                  from 1787 Draped Bust Left dies although there is no existing record that the state granted this new business specific authority to do so
                  except as provided in the original franchise designed to run for a period "not exceeding five years." There must have been some tacit approval
                  for the continuation of a mint after June 1, 1787, since on June 20, 1789, the legislature suspended the further production of copper coinage.
                  More 1787 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers were emitted by far from <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company, whatever their
                  legal position, than came from the authorized Company for Coining Coppers. Of further interest is that the copper used by <name type="pname"
                     >Jarvis</name> for his <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coins was fraudulently diverted from Federal stocks intended for the Fugio
                  series.</p>
               <p>Individual characteristics of this abundant 1787 Draped Bust Left coinage, described by <name type="pname">Breen</name>, help identify the
                  mint of origin, whether the Company for Coining Coppers prior to June 1, 1787, or <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company which operated
                  until the Fall of 1788. Those earlier 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers attributed to the Company for Coining Coppers have large letters in their
                  legends, whereas those later issues from <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company have small letters. The abundant 1787 Draped Bust Left
                     <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series with small letters from the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> Mint is not a homogeneous group
                  since significant weight differences exist between certain varieties. Specifically those 1787 coppers characterized by small crosses in both
                  obverse and reverse legends (<name type="pname">Miller</name> obverses 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 38, 45, 46, and 48 and reverses g, BB, CC, DD,
                  FF, and GG) and those with both obverse and reverse fleurons (<name type="pname">Miller</name> 34, 36, 37, 39, and 56 with e, h, i, k, l, cc,
                  ee, ff, HH, and RR) are significantly heavier than the remaining Draped Bust Left population. The remainder of the small lettered <name
                     type="pname">Jarvis</name> coppers, which are lighter in weight, possess cinquefoils in the legends, an ornament also found on the Fugio
                  cents. In earlier research, <name type="pname">Breen</name> ascertained that the order of emission within the small lettered 1787 Draped Bust
                  Left issues began with the varieties with crosses, followed by those with fleurons, and was concluded by the very large population with
                  cinquefoils, a sequence characterized by decreasing planchet weight.<ref target="#CH7-n45">45</ref> This suggests that as the 1787 Draped Bust
                  Left coinages progressed, the average coin weight lessened with diminished regard for the authorized 144 grain requirement. A number of these
                  1787 Draped Bust Left hubs were used again in 1788 with new reverses, but these, and all other 1788-dated <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> coppers, weighed substantially below the required 144 grains. The significance of these weight differences will be
                  discussed at length in Chapter Eight.<ref target="#CH7-n46">46</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Breen</name> has further calculated the total output of the Company for Coining Coppers at 1,407,000 for the years 1785 to
                  1787, while <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company produced about 3,500,000 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers from 1787 to
                     1788.<ref target="#CH7-n47">47</ref> With about five million coins thus accounted for, a conservative estimate of <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> coppers minted from all sources would exceed seven million. While there are 355 die combinations, many of these dies
                  probably fractured very early in use since some of these varieties are very rare today.</p>
               <p>At least three other illegal mints produced <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers bearing the date 1787, although the date inscribed
                  carries no guarantee as to the actual year of manufacture. The first <pb n="176"/> of these obviously contemporary counterfeit pieces is
                  nicknamed the "Bull Head," "Muttonhead," or "Bradford Head," after a seeming likeness to the second governor of the <name type="place"
                     >Plymouth Colony</name>, <name type="pname">William Bradford</name>. The "Muttonhead" is found in three obverse die states representing
                  significant reworkings of the original with varying degrees of boldness in the legends. A clue as to the location of the clandestine operation
                  responsible for this issue is provided by examination of the number punches for the date and the artistic style of the central devices. These
                  bear striking similarity to those used by the <name type="place">New York City</name> mint of <name type="pname">John Bailey</name> on his
                     <name type="place">NOVA EBORAC</name> and EXCELSIOR coppers.<ref target="#CH7-n48">48</ref> However, caution must be exercised in the
                  interpretation of punch-link evidence derived only from naked-eye examination unless corroborated by more precise photographic techniques.<ref

               <p>There are four distinct 1787 dated <name type="place">Connecticut</name> die combinations from a different source than those already

                     Jersey</name>, mint of <name type="pname">Walter Mould</name>. These four <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and the <name type="place"
                     >Morristown</name> varieties all demonstrate by naked-eye examination a characteristic horseshoe shaped "U." However, using the
                  superposition technique of enlarged transparent films, it becomes the "N," "C," and "A" punches which are actually identical, and not the "U"
                  punch as has been traditionally asserted.<ref target="#CH7-n50">50</ref> An interesting and very common member of this <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> series is <name type="pname">Miller</name> 4-L, the so-called "Horned Bust," which exhibits the gradual emergence of a
                  die break in the central left field in front of the obverse figure's armor. As this die flaw enlarges, it runs into the figure's mail so that
                  subsequent impressions look like a horn emanating from the chest (see <ref target="#fig-106">fig. 53</ref>).<ref target="#CH7-n51">51</ref>

               <p>The last illegal location responsible for 1787-dated <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers is considered to have been the mint of
                     <name type="pname">Captain Thomas Machin</name>. The attribution of some 1787-dated <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers to this
                  mint is based on the fact these coppers possess common punches and a bust style typical of the the legal <name type="place">Vermont</name>
                  bust right coppers and the imitation English halfpence, both possibly the work of <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name>. While there is
                  nothing that documents who actually engraved these similar appearing figures, from naked-eye observation there is certainly a common theme to
                  various dies suggesting the same author. <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> was particularly active in minting <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> coppers dated 1788 despite the fact that no legal authority existed for manufacturing coins of that date. It is
                  speculated that this operation bought out, or otherwise acquired, the existing equipment of <name type="pname">Walter Mould</name>, <name
                     type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company, and the remaining dies by <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name>, including the mailed bust left
                  Triple Leaves hubs which are described below. The procurement of the discarded equipment by <name type="pname">Machin</name> is the most
                  logical explanation for the existence of so many muled 1788-dated coins struck from combined dies from so many different sources.</p>
               <p>The greatest mystery surrounds the provenance of the mailed bust left Triple Leaves design of 1787 and 1788. The hubs from which these dies
                  were prepared were the work of <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name> who apparently did not pass them along to <name type="pname">Jarvis</name>
                  and Company when the Company for Coining Coppers dissolved. When <name type="pname">Buell</name> departed for <name type="place"
                     >England</name> in early 1789, it is supposed that he gave these Triple Leaves hubs to his son, <name type="pname">Benjamin</name>, who
                  minted some 1787-dated varieties from a presently unknown location early in 1789, despite their 1787 date. After minting a few coppers from
                  his father's Triple Leaves hubs, <name type="pname">Benjamin</name> seemingly retired from minting activies and relinquished his residual
                  gear, including the hubs, to <name type="pname">Captain Machin</name>. The <name type="pname">Machin</name> organization muled some of <name
                     type="pname">Buell</name>'s Triple Leaves obverse dies with new reverses, attributed to <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name>, to
                  produce several die varieties of 1788-dated <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers.</p>
               <pb n="177"/>
               <p>The practice of overstriking new coins on existing coppers occurred in the 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series, when <name
                     type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers and, rarely, counterfeit <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents, were used as host
                  coins for <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, instead of using new planchets. This was an economy measure whereby the minter
                  avoided the cost of planchet preparation by feeding preexisting coins of the correct size into the presses where they received a new stamp. It
                  was particularly advantageous when the host coins were less valuable than the newly stamped coppers, since the profit margin derived from the
                  manufacture of the new money could be substantially increased. The stratagem of overstriking a copper coin of higher commercial value on a
                  lighter, cheaper coin was not an original one in the colonies. <name type="pname">Batty</name> described a 1773 counterfeit English halfpenny
                  struck over a genuine Irish halfpenny as a host coin.<ref target="#CH7-n52">52</ref> The differential in exchange rates between <name
                     type="place">England</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> would have allowed an immediate 9.25% profit for the entrepreneur.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n53">53</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A perusal of the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series not only reveals an impressive number of bust styles but also what appears to be
                  at first glance misspelled legends such as AUCIORI, AUCTOBI, AUCTOPI, CONNFC, CONNLC, FNDE, INDL, IIB, and LIR. These so-called blundered
                  legends have been scrutinized by <name type="pname">Edward R. Barnsley</name> who presents convincing evidence that these "misspellings" are
                  not orthographic errors committed by some untutored diesinker, but rather the substitution of similar letters when the proper letter punch
                  required to complete the inscription was unavailable and presumably broken.<ref target="#CH7-n54">54</ref> "B" appears to be the most
                  frequently missing letter. The die maker would fashion missing letters out of resources at hand, such as developing an "E" from an "F" or a
                  "B" from a "P". <name type="pname">Barnsley</name> concluded that some blunders may actually have been unfinished improvisations where, for
                  example, the "L" was not hand finished into an "E" as in INDL and CONNLC. The one blunder which <name type="pname">Barnsley</name> postulates
                  as a true error is FNDE for INDE, for which no attempted correction is evident. Other errors were corrected by overpunching, the most notable
                  being the dates 1787 over 1877, and 1787 over 1788. Since numbers in the dates were punched into the die one at a time, the first error
                  occurred when the middle two digits were reversed and then rectified. The second error resulted from a perseveration with the "8" number
                  punch, which was then corrected when the appropriate "7" was punched over the erroneous final "8," "or perhaps the calendar year was
                  inadvertently entered, rather than the fictitious 1787."<ref target="#CH7-n55">55</ref> In Chapter Eight there is an extensive evaluation of
                  the average weights of the Confederation issues to determine if the various mints fulfilled their obligation to produce full weight coppers
                  designed to improve the quality of the circulating small change medium. Within the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series, it will be
                  demonstrated that the Company for Coining Coppers was conscientious in its duty, but after the operation was assumed by <name type="pname"
                     >Jarvis</name> and Company, the coins generally became lighter. The 1786 and 1787 coppers from illegal mints and any coppers dated 1788
                  were below the authorized 144 grains, with many of the latter overstruck on light host coins. The promise of good <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> coppers to replace the counterfeit halfpence was lost as clandestine mints just added to the glut of inferior
                  coins.</p>

                     purposeful ruse to obfuscate the activities of the operation. "Implements" is defined as "the apparatus, or set of utensils, instruments,
                     etc. employed in any trade or in executing any piece of work" (<hi rend="italic">O.E.D.</hi>). A "tool" is "an instrument or apparatus
                     necessary to a person in the practice of his vocation." <name type="pname">Swift</name> wrote in 1724, (<hi rend="italic">The Drapier's

               <p>The <name type="place">New Jersey</name> mint was established in a <name type="place">Rahway</name> mill leased from <name type="pname">Daniel
                     Marsh</name>; the rent guaranteed by <name type="pname">Matthias Ogden</name>, who acted as bondsman. From the beginning, the partnership
                  fared poorly because <name type="pname">Mould</name> failed to post his one third share of the surety bond. The other two partners petitioned
                  the Legislature to allow them to pursue their own two-thirds interest in the franchise independently of <name type="pname">Mould</name>. The
                  request was approved on November 22, 1786, authorizing <name type="pname">Goadsby</name> and <name type="pname">Cox</name> to mint two million
                  coppers, who then continued their project at <name type="place">Rahway</name>. <name type="pname">Mould</name> was allowed to mint his
                  one-third portion of the coinage and he established his solo operation at <name type="place">Morristown</name> but could not proceed until
                  January 19, 1787, when he <pb n="179"/> finally secured his own bond. The <name type="place">Rahway</name> mint had a series of legal problems
                  when its principals became entangled in a number of law suits.<ref target="#CH7-n59">59</ref> There is no clear record of the engravers
                  responsible for the <name type="place">Rahway</name> mint dies, although there has been an attempt to link this work to <name type="pname"
                     >James F. Atlee</name>, but the claim is refuted by evidence advanced by both <name type="pname">Sipsey</name> and <name type="pname"
                     >Hodder</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n60">60</ref> In fact, <name type="pname">Sipsey</name> suggests it would have been more likely that the
                     <name type="place">New York City</name> gold and silversmiths, <name type="pname">Daniel Van Voorhis</name> and <name type="pname">William
                     Coley</name>, were the artists who cut the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> dies for <name type="pname">Albion Cox</name>, and not
                     <name type="pname">Atlee</name>. The horse "head left" varieties have been attributed also to the <name type="place">Rahway</name> mint but
                  again the engraver has not been identified. <name type="pname">Thomas Goadsby</name> has been mentioned but there is no evidence that he was
                  an engraver or possessed the technical skills necessary for the task. Problems continued at the <name type="place">Rahway</name> mint and on
                  June 7, 1788, the equipment was placed by court order in the custody of the bondsman, <name type="pname">Matthias Ogden</name>, who in June
                  1789, relocated the equipment to <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> and continued production there in association with <name type="pname"
                     >Gilbert Rindell</name>. Despite the unsettled business environment, "<name type="pname">Goadsby</name> and <name type="pname">Cox</name>,"
                  first by the partnership and next under the auspices of <name type="pname">Ogden</name> and <name type="pname">Rindell</name>, either
                  completed the franchise for two million coppers by July 3, 1788, or paid the required 300,000 coppers by that date.<ref target="#CH7-n61"
                     >61</ref> It is evident that <name type="pname">Ogden</name> illegally exceeded the franchise by producing more <name type="place">New
                     Jersey</name> coins at his <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> location well into 1790. Many of his coppers were overstruck on existing
                  lighter weight coins using leftover <name type="place">Rahway</name> dies. He must have had a supply of original planchets as well, since not
                  all coppers were impressed on existing host coins.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Mould</name> continued his work at <name type="place">Morristown</name> and by August 1788, fulfilled his authorized
                  allotment of one million coppers.<ref target="#CH7-n62">62</ref> The <name type="place">Morristown</name> mint produced the large planchet
                     <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers; although the die sinkers are undocumented, it could have been <name type="pname"
                  >Mould</name>, himself, since he was reputed to have worked in <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, possibly as an engraver, prior to his
                  arrival in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. The 1788-dated <name type="place">Morristown</name> coppers are generally inferior in quality
                  and workmanship to the 1787 varieties. There is a series of 1787 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers punch linked to the <name
                     type="place">Morristown</name> output but the circumstances concerning these issues are unknown. Again by tracing dies and punches, it has
                  been proposed that some of <name type="pname">Mould</name>'s engraving tools came into the possession of <name type="pname">Machin's
                     Mills</name> where they were later used.</p>
               <p>Other <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers of 1788 appear to be the work of <name type="pname">John Bailey</name> of <name
                     type="place">New York City</name>, the partner of <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>, well known for his famous <name type="pname"
                     >Brasher</name> gold doubloon. Recent research by <name type="pname">Trudgen</name> reveals that <name type="pname">Bailey</name> was a
                  subcontractor for <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers working most probably on the behalf of <name type="pname">Walter
                     Mould</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n63">63</ref> On two occasions, <name type="pname">Bailey</name> acted as surety for <name type="pname"
                     >Mould</name> in law suits. The <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers attributed to <name type="pname">Bailey</name> bear a
                  characteristic "running horse" mint mark in the reverse legend.<ref target="#CH7-n64">64</ref> These 1788 <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                  coins are said to be punch linked to the <name type="place">Nova Eborac</name> and Excelsior coppers and to the famous <name type="pname"
                     >Brasher</name> gold doubloon. Of less certain origin is the contemporary counterfeit nicknamed the "Serpent Head" (<name type="pname"
                     >Maris</name> 54-k) which has been attributed to a <name type="pname">Mr. Hatfield</name> of <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name>.</p>
               <p>Considerable controversy attends the role of <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> in the manufacture of <name type="place">New
                     Jersey</name> coppers and at least two lines of speculation have been advanced, each supported by documentary evidence. A book published in
                  1891, <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place">Newburgh</name>: Her Institutions, Industries, and Leading Citizens</hi>, stated that <name type="pname">Captain
                     Machin</name>'s mint was the source of the first coins bearing the motto E PLURIBUS UNUM.<ref target="#CH7-n65">65</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Crosby</name> quoted <name type="pname">Charles I. Bushnell</name> who wrote that some coppers from the mint bore the
                  figure of a plough, a possible reference to either <name type="place">Vermont</name> or <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                  <pb n="180"/> coppers.<ref target="#CH7-n66">66</ref> Some letters on the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> "Camel Heads" (<name
                     type="pname">Maris</name> 56 to 58-n) were punched by tools, originally the property of <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company,
                  which, when discarded, eventually came into <name type="pname">Machin</name>'s possession. These same letter punches were used on some 1788
                     <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers considered the work of <name type="pname">Atlee</name> and struck at <name type="pname"
                     >Machin's Mills</name>. For these several reasons it is held that <name type="pname">Atlee</name> engraved and minted the <name
                     type="place">New Jersey</name> "Camel Heads" at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> using some of the same ex-<name type="pname"
                     >Jarvis</name> punches, the same ones with which it is supposed <name type="pname">Atlee</name> prepared some 1788 <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> dies.<ref target="#CH7-n67">67</ref> The other explanation is that <name type="pname">Atlee</name> made the "camel
                  head" dies for the <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> mint of <name type="pname">Matthias Ogden</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n68">68</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Atlee</name>, or whoever was the die sinker for the "camel heads" series, could have traveled widely selling his services
                  to various mints without requiring any permanent residence at a specific location, hence the artist and the mint do not have to coincide
                  geographically. There are other reasons, based on the overstriking characteristics of the "camel heads," which make <name type="pname"
                     >Machin's Mills</name> a less likely place of origin for this very sizable group of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers.</p>

               <p>The standard reference for the attribution of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers was published by <name type="pname">Dr. Edward
                     Maris</name> in 1880. Considering the number of engravers who produced <name type="place">New Jersey</name> dies, there is a surprising
                  level of consistency in design among the coins except for the head left obverses and the two rare obverse patterns, <name type="pname"
                     >Maris</name> 7 and 8. <name type="pname">Maris</name> described the more complex plough on Head Left coppers by drawing attention to the
                  detail of the coulter which "after widening, is joined to the share, which is made out of a sword beaten into proper shape," the engraver
                  obviously yielding to the entreaties of the Old Testament prophets.<ref target="#CH7-n69">69</ref> There are a number of rare contemporary
                  counterfeits (<name type="pname">Maris</name>-79, 80, 81, 83, and 84) from unknown sources but the common "serpent head," supposedly by <name
                     type="pname">Hatfield</name>, was manufactured in fairly large numbers. The total number of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers
                  includes the three million authorized coins in addition to those minted independently by <name type="pname">Ogden</name> at <name type="place"
                     >Rahway</name> and <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name>, the prolific <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 to 58-n group, plus those
                  attributed to <name type="pname">Bailey</name> and <name type="pname">Hatfield</name> sources. A conservative estimate of <name type="place"
                     >New Jersey</name> coppers from all mints would be, therefore, in the range of four million or more pieces.</p>
               <p>The same irony attended the last issues of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers as was observed in the <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> series. The enabling legislation for both mints decried the abundance of counterfeits in circulation and the fraud
                  inflicted on the people, especially the poor, "honest &amp; unsuspicious <pb n="182"/> Citizens."<ref target="#CH7-n70">70</ref> Following the
                  expiration of the legal franchises in both states, coining fell into the hands of other entrepreneurs who flooded commerce with their own
                  lightweight products, notwithstanding the fact that coppers had the appropriate designs and labels. In <name type="place">New Jersey</name>,
                     <name type="pname">Matthias Ogden</name>, a celebrated Revolutionary War hero, after his less than satisfactory business experience with
                  the authorized mints, concluded his coining career in <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> after taking over the <name type="place"
                     >Rahway</name> mint franchise. Here, <name type="pname">Ogden</name> followed the popular practice of overstriking <name type="place">New
                     Jersey</name> emblems on existing coins which were significantly lighter than the prescribed 150 grains although he did use some original
                  planchets which were likewise underweight. The <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coinage had also been adulterated with lightweight money
                  from other still unidentified clandestine operations. Lightweight coppers, rather than being suppressed by these state mints, were
                  paradoxically encouraged.</p>
               <p>Recent work by <name type="pname">Hodder</name> on <name type="place">New Jersey</name> die emission sequences of the <name type="pname"
                     >Maris</name> J, U, f, and g families of reverse dies has exploded some of the traditional concepts about the minting practices of these
                  early coiners.<ref target="#CH7-n71">71</ref> The J reverse for the <name type="place">Rahway</name> mint was a very durable die since it
                  survived long enough to be married to ten different obverses. In the course of its life, progressive breaks, clash marks, or other signs of
                  die failure occurred resulting in the possible identification of five distinct J reverse die states. These physical markers provide the means
                  for the relative chronological dating of when the J die was combined with the various observes. This study was expanded to include the U
                  reverse and the 15 and 33 obverses, all of which have inherent deformities from progressive die injury.</p>
               <p>One might intuitively think that the colonial mintmaster placed a pair of dies in the press and stamped them until one or both of the dies
                  failed. A spent die would then be retired or discarded, and any surviving die partner, if still serviceable, would then be combined with a new
                  mate, and so on. Sometimes two completely new dies would be employed and removed simultaneously. The assumption would be that the use of dies
                  followed a relatively orderly and logical paradigm. On the contrary, <name type="pname">Hodder</name>'s investigations demonstrate that nine
                  of the ten obverse dies were used intermittently throughout the entire life of the J reverse; one obverse die was not spent before another was
                  placed into service, and then the former one was called out of retirement in a haphazard sequence for yet another session in the press. In
                  only one instance, <name type="pname">Maris</name> 15-J, was the obverse used with only one stage of the reverse, never to be called upon
                  again. <name type="pname">Maris</name> 34-J, in contrast, was found married to all five J reverse conditions, meaning that 34-J coppers were
                  periodically minted from the earliest days of the <name type="place">Rahway</name> mint in 1787 into 1790 by which time the equipment had been
                  relinquished to <name type="pname">Ogden</name> in <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name>.</p>
               <p>Obverse dates on these coppers are inconsequential and provide no indication as to when the coin was actually struck. A few of the 1786-dated
                  coppers studied by <name type="pname">Hodder</name> could have been minted in that year, but the majority were made from 1787 into 1790.
                  Conversely, a few 1787-dated coins, <name type="pname">Maris</name> 33-U for example, could possibly have been minted in 1786. At best, the
                  date may only be a useful guide to when the die was prepared. Examination of the J die states also reveals that coins were being
                  simultaneously overstruck on host coins and struck on original planchets after mid-1789 when the operation moved from <name type="place"
                     >Rahway</name> to <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name>. <name type="pname">Ogden</name> obviously had a source for new copper. With a
                  few notable exceptions which are still being studied, a gradual decrease in weight from the authorized standard of 150 grains has been
                  observed within these families over the passage of time. When the <name type="place">Rahway</name> mint first opened in November 1786, until
                  the spring of 1787, the average weight of J family coppers was 147.4 ¬± 7.9 grains, but by the closing bell in 1790, the weight decreased to a
                  final low of 134.9 ¬± 15.3 grains. These data exclude any overstruck coins. Not only did the average weight decrease during that period, but
                  the standard deviation increased. This increase in the standard deviation, a measure of dispersion more sensitive than the range, indicates a
                  wider weight range <pb n="183"/> or lack of conformity in weight within the planchet population, another clue as to the relaxation of quality
                  standards at the mint operation with the passage of time.</p>
               <p>New research on <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers supports the notion that it is hazardous to assign with certainty the facility
                  where the coins were actually minted. Further work with other traceable dies may confirm this mosaic pattern of emission sequence for other
                     <name type="place">Rahway</name> coppers. What does become evident is that many more coppers, once considered the products of the <name
                     type="place">Rahway</name> mint, were actually minted by <name type="pname">Ogden</name> after he took control of the operation and moved
                  to <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> in mid-1789. This bench mark is based on the occurrence of overstruck coppers midway in the useful
                  life of the J reverse as determined by the physical configuration of the die. This subject is far more complex than once considered and
                  requires further research for elucidation.</p>

               <p>Although by an Act of June 15, 1785, <name type="place">Vermont</name> was actually the first American jurisdiction to authorize a local mint
                  for the production of coppers, the territory was not part of the Confederation but rather a self-proclaimed, independent republic. <name
                     type="place">Vermont</name> was not one of the original colonies; its lands were claimed both by <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>
                  and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>; the Crown recognized the ownership by the latter. <name type="pname">Ethan Allen</name> and his Green
                  Mountain Boys were organized to defend land titles granted by <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> against the intrusion of <name
                     type="place">New York</name>. The dispute became of secondary importance during the Revolution when all forces were united against the
                  English. Ignoring the authority of both its neighbors, <name type="place">Vermont</name> declared itself a republic on January 15, 1777, and
                  remained so until admission into the Union on March 4, 1791. It was under the independent regime that copper coins were minted dated 1785 to
                     1788.<ref target="#CH7-n72">72</ref>

               <p>The franchise to produce <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers was awarded to <name type="pname">Reuben Harmon, Jr.</name>, of <name
                     type="place">Rupert</name>, who engaged a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> engraver, presumably the goldsmith, <name type="pname">William
                     Coley</name>, to prepare the dies. The first issues were the handsome landscape types of 1785 and 1786, featuring the sun rising to the
                  right above a wooded hill with a plow facing left in the foreground, the inscription "Republic of <name type="place">Vermont</name>," in
                  various Latin forms, and the date surround the design. The reverse simulates the <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers as it
                  depicts a central eye of Providence with rays radiating to the periphery.<ref target="#CH7-n73">73</ref> The legend, STELLA QUARTA DECIMA,
                  "The Fourteenth Star," alluded to the Republic's ambition to become the fourteenth state. The originally prescribed <pb n="184"/> weight of
                  160 grains was unrealistically heavy and soon was reduced to 111 grains. Two successive five year franchises were contracted. During the first
                  five years no royalties were required, but over the second, a 2.5% fee was payable to the Republic.</p>
               <p>In 1786 an obverse bust design was adopted with new legends, AUCTORI VERMON, "By the Authority of <name type="place">Vermont</name>." The
                  seated reverse figure was a likeness of the contemporary English halfpenny with the inscription, INDE ET LIB, very much like the <name
                     type="place">Connecticut</name> coinage. There has been discussion of the motivation that prompted the abrupt change in the appearance from
                  the landscape to the bust motif. The traditional reasoning was that figures like the current English halfpence would be familiar and,
                  therefore, more acceptable to the population. The argument is weak since the average person showed no reluctance to accept <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> or <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers, both of which displayed originality in their designs. Additionally,
                  since people had felt cheated by so many counterfeit English coppers, they might have had more faith in something distinct and obviously
                  genuine. <name type="pname">Bonjour</name> postulates that the prime reason for the change was an expedient to obtain dies from the
                  experienced <name type="place">Connecticut</name> die cutter, <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n74">74</ref> No formal
                  connection with <name type="pname">Buell</name> ever materialized, perhaps because his energies were consumed by the Fugio project, and so the
                     <name type="place">Rupert</name> mint sought assistance elsewhere.</p>
               <p>One of the new 1786 designs was the famous bust right "Baby Head" which has a striking similarity to the counterfeit 1786 <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> "Large Head" (1786 <name type="pname">Miller</name> 3-D), speculatively attributed to <name type="pname">Atlee</name>
                  while he was still in <name type="place">New York City</name> inferring that <name type="pname">Coley</name> copied his work. The <name
                     type="place">Vermont</name> bust left coppers of 1786 and early 1787 closely resemble the standard <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
                  Mailed Bust Left series prepared by <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name> and debate continues as to the identity of the actual engravers and
                  die sinkers for these early <name type="place">Vermont</name> issues.<ref target="#CH7-n75">75</ref> Some of this mystery has been unraveled
                  in unpublished studies by <name type="pname">Spilman</name> who demonstrates that these <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers were
                  produced from <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s genuine 1786 <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
                  <q>... "complex" hubs from which the legend letters and border details were ground away and the hair on the head of the obverse bust also
                     "cut" or shortened by grinding. The date element on the reverse was retained ... note the shape of the 6 in the date element. The dies were
                     sunk from these altered hubs and the <name type="place">Vermont</name> legends were added on the individual dies .... The reverse figure on
                        <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 11 [<name type="pname">Bressett</name> 9-H] is badly double hubbed (the legend letters are

                  <p>(e) This 1788 <name type="place">Vermont</name> RR-18 (106.2 grains) from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> was overstruck on a
                     counterfeit Irish halfpenny (usually dated 1781 or 1782) remarkable for its deficient weight (genuine Irish halfpence weigh 134.6 grains).
                     The III REX is visible over the reverse seated figure's head (Table 21, no. 21c; Table 27).</p>

               <p>The reverse of <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 15 (<name type="pname">Bressett</name> 9-I) was very poorly executed and a die break
                  immediately occurred which obliterated the date causing its early abandonment and, hence, its extreme rarity. The extensive recutting used to
                  create these <name type="place">Vermont</name> dies is reminiscent of the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> "Hercules Head" which was also
                  altered from the Mailed Bust Left complex hub.</p>
               <p>In 1787, the <name type="place">Rupert</name> enterprise was expanded by Harmon to include <name type="pname">Coley</name>, who had moved from
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>. This occurred at the same time that <name type="pname">Captain Thomas Machin</name> was developing his
                  operation in <name type="place">Newburgh</name>, and an agreement was reached between the <name type="place">Rupert</name> and <name
                     type="place">Newburgh</name> mints providing for profit sharing arrangements and the authority to produce <name type="place">Vermont</name>
                  coppers legally at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>. <name type="pname">Daniel Van Voorhis</name>, the <name type="place">New
                     York</name> goldsmith, was also a party to this contract. The 1787 and 1788 <name type="place">Vermont</name> Bust Right dies, the illegal
                  1786 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, and the imitation English halfpence from <name type="place">Newburgh</name> all have a
                  "familial" resemblance and are punch linked together. One 1788 <name type="place">Vermont</name> copper, <name type="pname"
                     >Ryder-Richardson</name> 27 or <name type="pname">Bressett</name> 18-W, in particular, has both obverse and reverse "device punch identity"
                  with certain imitation British halfpence and the 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
                  <name type="pname">Miller</name> 2-D reverse, confirming a common origin to this sundry group of coppers.<ref target="#CH7-n77">77</ref> The
                  reverse shields of 1787 and 1788 <name type="place">Vermont</name> Bust Right coppers, in common with the imitation halfpence, display the
                  crosses of <name type="pname">St. Andrew</name> and <name type="pname">St. George</name> whereas previous <name type="place">Vermont</name>
                  bust coppers and the entire <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series either have a plain shield or a local emblem. The association between
                  the later <name type="place">Vermont</name> coinages and the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> partnership is confirmed both by
                  documentary and numismatic evidence.</p>
               <p>Both <name type="place">Rupert</name> and, later, <name type="place">Newburgh</name> used a ready made source of planchets by overstriking
                  other coppers with their <name type="place">Vermont</name> designs. From the <name type="place">Rupert</name> facility, 1785-dated <name
                     type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers, which were heavier than the required 111 grains, are frequently encountered as undertypes
                  for 1787 Bust Right issues.<ref target="#CH7-n78">78</ref> A <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Act of April 20, 1787, designed to curb the
                     <pb n="186"/> circulation of coppers under 145.8 grains, effective August 1, 1787, was likely responsible for the ready availability of
                  these otherwise unwanted <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> pieces.<ref target="#CH7-n79">79</ref> As the commercial value for these
                  unauthorized coppers dropped because of regulation, such coins assumed a greater role as ready-made planchets than as inflated token money.
                  When the <name type="place">Rupert</name> mint closed early in 1789, the serviceable equipment was removed to <name type="place"
                     >Newburgh</name> where some still workable <name type="place">Rupert</name> dies were used to overstrike counterfeit Irish halfpence dated
                  1781 and 1782, substantial numbers of which were catalogued in the <name type="pname">Batty</name> collection.<ref target="#CH7-n80">80</ref>
                  The assumption is made that these spurious coppers arrived here from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> and were bought up in bulk by the <name
                     type="pname">Machin</name>'s facility, which used them solely for <name type="place">Vermont</name> host coins.</p>
               <p>The classification of <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers follows three schemes. The oldest one is by <name type="pname">Hillyer
                     Ryder</name>, published in 1919,<ref target="#CH7-n81">81</ref> and later expanded by <name type="pname">John M. Richardson</name>; the
                  second was "issued about 1957 by <name type="pname">Kenneth E. Bressett</name>, using a numbering system devised by <name type="pname">Walter
                     Breen</name>";<ref target="#CH7-n82">82</ref> the last system of attribution, also by <name type="pname">Bressett</name>, arranges the
                  obverse and reverse combinations in order of use.</p>
               <p>While there is no available census as to the number of <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers minted, <name type="pname">Bressett</name>
                  has estimated that there are no more than 5000 specimens of all the 40 die combinations in existence today. A rare counterfeit, designated as
                     <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 5, is known struck from dies and a second, more common variety, is cast from the first. The
                  origin and source of these pieces is unknown.<ref target="#CH7-n83">83</ref>

               <head>MACHIN'S MILLS COINAGE</head>
               <p>Much has been said previously about <name type="pname">Captain Thomas Machin</name>. His mills seem to have been the graveyard for other
                  defunct coining operations since leftover minting equipment apparently wound up in his possession. This interesting figure in early American
                  numismatics was born in <name type="place">England</name> in 1744 where he trained as an artillery cadet and civil engineer.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n84">84</ref> He emigrated to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in 1772 and eventually moved to <name type="place"
                     >Boston</name> where his sympathies supported the patriot cause. His combined talents were used in the fortification of <name type="place"
                     >Bunker Hill</name> and later in the defense of the <name type="place">Hudson River</name> where he engineered the successful installation
                  of a chain over the river at West Point to impede the advance of the English fleet. He was wounded in the War where he served as an engineer,
                  artilleryman, and recruiter. Following discharge after eight years of service, he entered civilian life and built a number of water-powered
                  mills. In March 1787, <name type="pname">Machin</name> unsuccessfully petitioned to mint coins for the State of <name type="place">New
                     York</name>. On April 18, 1787, he formed a partnership with a number of individuals, including <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name>,
                  to mint coins in a mill he had previously erected in <name type="place">Newburgh</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>. The mint may have
                  been erected in the confident expectation of providing a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> coinage, a proposal which was defeated. While no
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> coinage was ever authorized, the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> group did negotiate an
                  arrangement with the legal <name type="place">Rupert</name>, <name type="place">Vermont</name>, mint on June 7, 1787, to assist them with
                  their contract.</p>

               <p>The output of <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>, described as a "manufactory of hardware," was varied.<ref target="#CH7-n85">85</ref>
                  It has been speculated that a number of patterns was prepared in anticipation that the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> legislature would
                  authorize a state coinage. Such trial pieces with a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> connection include the 1786 NON VI VIRTUTE
                     VICI/NEO-EBORACENSIS,<ref target="#CH7-n86">86</ref> the 1787 <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_27874920">George Clinton</name>, and perhaps the various EXCELSIOR
                     coppers.<ref target="#CH7-n87">87</ref> The low mintage of these patterns accounts for their extreme rarity today.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> participation in a number of 1787 and 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers has been

                  overstruck on 1785 <name type="place">Constellatio Novas</name>. The procedure of striking over existing coins obviously produced more profit
                  for <name type="pname">Captain Machin</name> and was more expedient than original planchet preparation.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>A major product from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> was a large number of English halfpence dated 1747, 1771, 1772, 1774 to 1778,
                  1787, and 1788.<ref target="#CH7-n88">88</ref> Since regal halfpence of <name type="pname">George II</name> were minted in 1747, and
                  legitimate <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence were made only from 1770 to 1775, the other dates selected were imaginary. The
                  halfpence which carried the same dates as legal issues are technically counterfeits, whereas the other fanciful ones are only "in imitation"
                  of the real coins. This series of American made, counterfeit English coppers can be identified and attributed from die punch evidence from
                  which <name type="pname">Trudgen</name> has identified three chronologically distinct groups and a fourth miscellaneous group.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n89">89</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Trudgen</name> attributes the first group to <name type="pname">Atlee</name> while he was still in <name type="place">New
                     York City</name> and the important aspect is that these are punch linked with 1786-dated counterfeit Bust Right <name type="place"
                     >Connecticuts</name>, also attributed to <name type="pname">Atlee</name>, suggesting that all these dies were prepared contemporaneously in
                  1786.</p>
               <p>The second group of imitation halfpence have letters and numbers in common with <name type="pname">John Bailey</name>'s coppers and <name
                     type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>'s doubloon, whereas the central figures are characteristic of a bust style typical of that attributed
                  to <name type="pname">Atlee</name>. These findings must suppose a close working relationship between <name type="pname">Atlee</name> and the
                  other coiners. The third cluster, thought to be the work of <name type="pname">Atlee</name>, was minted at <name type="pname">Machin's
                     Mills</name> after his connection with that organization. The last miscellaneous group comprises several illogical die combinations
                  including the rare IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> die.</p>
               <pb n="189"/>
               <p>The counterfeit halfpence from <name type="place">Newburgh</name> are distinct and must not be confused with the immense number of English
                  forgeries, generally of finer quality, which were imported during that time. Both the imported and domestic counterfeit halfpence circulated
                  together as evidenced by the <name type="pname">Stepney</name>. <name type="place">Connecticut</name> hoard where about one-quarter of the 72
                  counterfeit British halfpence inventoried were of <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> origin, the rest being from <name type="place"
                     >England</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n90">90</ref> It cannot be determined from the sample uncovered in this hoard if these numbers are
                  representative of the coppers in circulation during that period. There are other counterfeit English halfpence of American manufacture but
                  these crude pieces have nothing in common with the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> output.</p>
               <p>The only "legal" coinage from the <name type="place">Newburgh</name> mint was the <name type="place">Vermont</name> series that was produced
                  under agreement and in cooperation with the <name type="place">Rupert</name> mint. The busts on these <name type="place">Vermont</name> pieces
                  bear a distinct familial appearance with the likeness of <name type="pname">George III</name> on the imitation halfpence attesting to a common
                  engraver. Those overstruck on 1785 <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers were from the <name type="place">Rupert</name>, <name
                     type="place">Vermont</name>, mint, while those impressed on counterfeit Irish halfpence were from the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>
                  facility toward the end of its minting operation and must have been the work of unskilled individuals. This is evidenced by the fact that the
                  last <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> were carelessly executed from old, broken, and
                  rejected dies. Moreover, some dies were not sufficiently hardened or the Irish host coins not properly annealed prior to striking with new
                     <name type="place">Vermont</name> labels. Consequently the dies fractured very early in their lives and thus we have few survivors today.
                  The later <name type="place">Vermont</name> issues, many of which are on Irish host coins, are among the rarest of all state coppers. This
                  slipshod workmanship probably occurred as the mint was about to close.</p>
               <p>A number of mules were minted by <name type="pname">Captain Machin</name>, employing obverse and reverse dies from different sources. The
                  unusual 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
                  <name type="pname">Miller</name> 1-I combines an <name type="pname">Atlee</name> small head from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>,
                  also used in 1787 as <name type="pname">Miller</name> 1.1-A and 1.1-VV, which is now married with <name type="place">Vermont</name> reverse,
                     <name type="pname">Bressett-U</name>. This same <name type="place">Vermont</name> reverse is in turn combined with an imitation English
                  halfpenny, <name type="pname">Vlack</name> 22-88 Vt. This one coin, 1788 <name type="pname">Miller</name> 1-I, therefore, is claimed by three
                  series of coppers, <name type="place">Connecticut</name>, <name type="place">Vermont</name>, and the imitation English halfpence.</p>

               <p>The <name type="place">Vermont</name> copper, <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 13 (<ref target="#fig-158">fig. 62</ref>), is another
                  interesting piece. The coin, made in <name type="place">Newburgh</name>, is a mule displaying a new, typical bust with <name type="place"
                     >Vermont</name> legends while the reverse, <name type="pname">Vlack</name> 87C, had been used in several previous varieties in the
                  imitation English halfpence series. The old reverse is very weak on the <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 13 combination since there
                  is selective disappearance of less deeply sunk details of the letters and central figure on this very shallow die due to a grinding down of
                  the surface.<ref target="#CH7-n91">91</ref> The traditional reason offered for this characteristic is that the die had been lapped
                  intentionally to obscure the legend, BRITANNIA. In a recent article, <name type="pname">Trudgen</name> disagrees with this explanation and
                  supports the observation, first made by <name type="pname">Wyllys Betts</name> in 1886, that the indistinct reverse results from previous,
                  honest wear and not a deliberate attempt to obliterate the legends.<ref target="#CH7-n92">92</ref> This piece also belongs to two separate
                  series. The <name type="place">Vermont</name> 1785 IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> (<name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 1),
                  marries a severely damaged or perhaps rejected <name type="place">Vermont</name> obverse with an equally inferior IMMUNE <name type="place"
                     >COLUMBIA</name> reverse die. This IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> reverse also saw service with an imitation halfpenny obverse
                  as <name type="pname">Vlack</name> 15-85NY. It can be speculated that this illogical muling of dies occurred in the final months of <name
                     type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> activity, indicative that the operation had become desperate, amateurish, and deteriorated.</p>
               <p>Speculation links the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> camel heads (<name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 to 58-n) to <name type="pname"
                     >Machin's Mills</name>, or at least attributes the die preparation to <name type="pname">Atlee</name>. The very common <name type="pname"
                     >Maris</name> 56-n (<ref target="#fig-147">fig. 57h</ref>) is found struck over the largest variety of host coins (see Appendix 2). The
                  long life of the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 obverse can be attributed to the fact that the die was well prepared and that there must
                  have been annealing capability to soften the host coins. If the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 clone were minted at <name type="pname"
                     >Machin's Mills</name>, it had to have been accomplished either before or separate from the last <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers,
                  since these demonstrate such technical inferiority in workmanship. These two emissions could not have been coeval. Since the <name
                     type="pname">Maris</name> 56 group appears over all descriptions of host coins, it is equally difficult to think that they were minted
                  contemporaneously with the 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> issues from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> which were only
                  overstruck over <name type="place">Constellatio Novas</name> and nothing else. These distinct host coin personalities must mean that these two
                  emissions, the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 issues and the 1788 <name type="place">Connecticuts</name>, had to have been separated in
                  time, but which came first? The finding of a <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56-n overstruck on a 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name>,
                     <name type="pname">Miller</name> 3-B.1, indicates that the "camel heads" were minted after the time that particular <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> copper was made.<ref target="#CH7-n93">93</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Activity at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> ceased although the termination date is unconfirmed. <name type="pname"
                     >Bushnell</name>,<ref target="#CH7-n94">94</ref> quoted by <name type="pname">Crosby</name>, said that operations ceased in 1791 which
                  appears illogical since <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers and British halfpence, assumed to be the major products of the mint, had
                  all but ceased to circulate by August 1789. <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers would have been the only reasonable coins for anyone
                  to have continued minting after the summer of 1789 since these still circulated preferentially due to legal tender status. There is no firm
                  evidence linking <name type="place">New Jersey</name> issues to <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> and certainly the <name type="pname"
                     >Maris</name> 56 to 58-n group, characterized by the superior, long-lived <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 obverse and host coin
                  attributes, has nothing in common with the deteriorated <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers thought to be the agonal output of the mint.
                  It is not known how much impact the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> operation had on the Confederation coinage, but certain <name
                     type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers attributed to that mint, the 1788 <name type="pname">Miller</name> 2-D in particular, remain fairly
                  common coins. A report, cited by <name type="pname">Crosby</name>, was less optimistic as it quoted the mint's 1789 production at about 1000
                  pounds of coppers, or about 63,000 coins, with little more accomplished in preceding years. From these data the source concluded that the mint
                  was not a profitable business.<ref target="#CH7-n95">95</ref>

                     18 and 25, averaged 103.7 ¬± 15.9 grains, whereas regal Irish halfpence were minted at 134.6 grains. Twenty-one Irish counterfeits of
                     various dates, averaging 106.7 ¬± 12.6 grains, are recorded in Table 21. Ratty counted 64 varieties of 1781 Irish halfpence, at least 8 of
                     which were cast counterfeits. For the following year, his collection contained 50 varieties, 5 of which were spurious, 4 being cast and 1
                     die struck. As with the English series of counterfeits, there were three purely fictitious dates, 1772, 1773, and 1783 (Ratty, <hi

               <p>The legal state coppers so far described were minted by private enterprise on contracts awarded by the various legislatures. Similarly,

                     type="pname">Joshua Wetherle</name> was appointed mintmaster for this project which lasted for about two years. The <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> coinage of 1787 and 1788 conformed to the Federal resolution adopted July 6, 1785, which established the decimal
                  ratio dollar as the money of account where each dollar of 100 cents equaled one Spanish milled dollar. The coppers, in half cent and cent
                  denominations, were to contain 78.75 and 157.5 grains pure copper, respectively. The new Federal system and the established <name type="place"
                     >New England</name> money of account, at six shillings to the Spanish milled dollar, were not exactly reconciled with each other. Coppers
                  in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, including the new decimal based cents, still passed at 18 to the shilling, or 108 to the Spanish
                  dollar, on the old money of account, rather than the 100 dictated by the Federal decimal requirement.<ref target="#CH7-n103">103</ref> By
                  settling a debt using coppers at 18 to the shilling, one would pay 8% more than under the Federal stipulations. The disparity in value between
                  the two systems further complicated financial transactions of the period.</p>

               <p>The <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents and half cents were well made pieces of uniform weight and quality. An Indian was depicted
                  on the obverse and a heraldic eagle on the reverse. It was the only copper of the period with all legends in English. The state-run mint
                  proved unprofitable with expenses 55% greater than the value of the struck coins.<ref target="#CH7-n105">105</ref> Aware of the provision in

                  coppers during the last months of the mint. Four lightweight counterfeit <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents dated for both years

                     <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents would have proven unprofitable as a ready source of planchets for overstruck coinage due to
                  their heavy weight. There are no instances recorded where authorized <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents were overstruck, only the

               <p>There has been frequent reference made to the <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers which have been attributed as a speculative
                  venture of <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name> who ordered the coins from <name type="place">Birmingham</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n110"
                     >110</ref> There have been some attempts to establish a domestic origin for the Constellatio <pb n="194"/>
                  <name type="place">Nova</name> coppers, linking them to the <name type="place">Nova Eborac</name> coppers of <name type="pname">Brasher</name>
                  and <name type="pname">Bailey</name> with which they appear to share some common letter punches. The reverse designs on the <name type="place"
                     >Vermont</name> landscape issues of 1785 and 1786 by <name type="pname">William Coley</name> are similar to, but not identical with the
                     <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> series.<ref target="#CH7-n111">111</ref> The mutual resemblance of these dies does suggest some
                  common, yet unidentified, bias. Despite any temptation, however strong, to suggest an American source for the <name type="place">Constellatio
                     Nova</name> coppers, contemporaneous newspaper accounts state that the <name type="place">Constellatio Novas</name> are an English product
                  "coined at <name type="place">Birmingham</name> by the order of a merchant in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>" who tradition identifies as
                     <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name>."<ref target="#CH7-n112">112</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There are three 1783 and six 1785 die pairs and three instances where a die is used in a second combination. This results in nine combinations
                  but excludes the very rare 1785 and 1786 contemporary counterfeits, which bear no relation to others in the series.<ref target="#CH7-n113"
                     >113</ref> A statement, quoted by <name type="pname">Crosby</name> from <hi rend="italic">The <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>
                     Centinel</hi>, alleged that 40 tons of copper were coined from one die pair alone, a most unlikely event.<ref target="#CH7-n114">114</ref>
                  A sample of <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers suggests that they were intended to weigh about 58 to the pound or 120 grains
                  each. Forty [long] tons would have amounted to over 5,000,000 pieces which indeed is an exaggeration for one set of dies, let alone the entire
                  coinage! The actual quantity of <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers can only be estimated from the fact that there were only
                  nine die pairs, two of which are rare. One could expect from 18,000 to 50,000 impressions per die under the best of circumstances and these
                  data would imply that the size of the coinage ranged from 162,000 to 450,000 pieces, or a maximum of 3.44 long tons of copper.<ref

               </p>
               <p>In 1788 and perhaps into 1789, several mints, including <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>, <name type="place">Rupert</name>, <name
                     type="place">Vermont</name>, and <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name>, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, struck their own dies over
                  preexisting coins at a time when it was less expensive or more convenient to do so. The <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> mint may not
                  always have had the necessary equipment to roll and cut copper stock into planchets. The circulation of lightweight coppers was restricted in
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> after August 1, 1787. Thereafter, such pieces, including the <name type="place">Constellatio
                     Novas</name>, became fair game for the coining presses of other operators who sought to legitimize underweight coins by impressing on them
                  an acceptable design and to send them off again into circulation with a new identity. Examination shows that 1785 <name type="place"
                     >Constellatio Nova</name> coppers were used as host coins for many 1787 <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers from <name type="place"
                     >Rupert</name> (<name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 14, 12, and 32; <name type="pname">Bressett</name> 10-K, 11-K, and 12-K) and for
                  1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>. An occasional 1783 <name type="place"
                     >Constellatio Nova</name> is found as the host for <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coins from the <name type="place"
                     >Elizabethtown</name> mint. The most common 1785 <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> host coin which can be attributed is the <name
                     type="pname">Crosby</name> 5-E, followed next by the 4-C and 4-D.<ref target="#CH7-n116">116</ref>
               </p>
               <p>From these data, some speculation can be made about the circulation of <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers. Research by <name
                     type="pname">Newman</name> suggests that, although dated 1783 and 1785, the coins were not common before May 1786.<ref target="#CH7-n117"
                     >117</ref> In fact it would have been unexpected, despite the 1783 date, to have found this series in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
                  prior to the signing of the peace treaty. <name type="pname">Felt</name> noted that in <pb n="195"/> 1788 the most common copper in <name
                     type="place">Massachusetts</name> was the 1783 <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n118">118</ref> Further
                  inspection of the 1785 <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> die varieties shows stylistic differences on the obverse changing from 30
                  to 29 and later to 26 paired leaves in the wreath. The 1785 <name type="pname">Crosby</name> 1-B, 2-A, and 3-B have 30 pairs as do all the
                  three 1783 varieties. The 1785 1-B shares a common obverse with the 1783 3-C, both displaying a misspelled CONSTELATIO. The six varieties
                  mentioned with 30 paired leaves are less commonly seen as host coins than are the other three issues, 5-E, 4-C, and 4-D, which in and of
                  themselves are much rarer coins. This suggests that as the first group arrived in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> they directly entered into
                  commerce, but when the second group, i.e. 4-C (30 pairs), 4-D (29 pairs), and 5-E (26 pairs), arrived at a later date the circulation of
                  coppers was becoming more sluggish and many were sold in bulk to minters. The last three varieties of the 1785 <name type="place">Constellatio
                     Nova</name> coppers must have appeared on the scene by July 1787, for them to have been used in the <name type="place">Rupert</name>
                     mint.<ref target="#CH7-n119">119</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Felt</name>, writing in 1839, apparently was not familiar with the 1785 <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers
                  anytime before January 1788, an observation which further indicates that those varieties were uncommonly seen in the Bay State by the time of
                  the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> mint.</p>

                  the 3-B is common, whereas the 4-C is rarity 5, the 4-D is rarity 6, and the 5-E is rarity 4. While the last three coins are much rarer as
                  unaltered coins, they are more common as host coins than the preceding three or any of the 1783 varieties. When these 1785 <name type="place"
                     >Constellatio Nova</name> coppers reached <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> and the <name type="place">Rupert</name> mint they
                  became host coins for 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers and 1787 <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers, respectively. For
                  the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coinage, the lighter weight <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers defrauded the
                  public, but for <name type="place">Vermont</name>, these ready-made host coins were heavier than the authorized weight.</p>
               <p>The following observations can be made about the <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers: [1] those predated 1783 were introduced
                  in about May 1786; [2] the first three varieties of 1785 arrived in close succession, either late 1786 or early 1787; [3] the last three 1785
                  varieties arrived before July 1787; [4] the rarity census noted by <name type="pname">Crosby</name> for the 4-C, 4-D, and 5-E does take into
                  account that many of these coins were overstruck and, therefore, fewer exist as originals; [5] the total coinage cannot exceed 450,000 and is
                  probably closer to 200,000; [6] the average weight for 28 <pb n="196"/> circulated 1783 specimens is 120.8 ¬± 15.8, and for 46 1785 varieties,
                  116.5 ¬± 7.2; the combined average is 118.1 ¬± 11.4, or about 59 to the pound (see Table 21). The higher standard deviation of ¬± 15.8 grains for
                  the 1783 issues indicates less consistency in planchet weight than for the 1785-dated tokens.</p>

               <head>FUGIO CENTS</head>
               <p>By the late 1780s, several states had taken action against the deluge of counterfeit coppers which saturated the small change medium. Within
                  the Confederation, <name type="place">Connecticut</name>, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, and <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>
                  had established mints or arranged for contract coinages as had the autonomous Republic of <name type="place">Vermont</name>. The <name
                     type="place">New York</name> Legislature responded to this raft of lightweight coins on April 20, 1787, by imposing restrictions on their
                  currency which prohibited those under 145.8 grains from circulation and devaluated all others from 14 to 20 coppers per local shilling.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n121">121</ref>
                  <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, in "AN ACT to prevent the circulation of bad and light Coppers in this State," decreed that after July
                  20, 1787, only its own coppers, or any produced by Congress, could pass.<ref target="#CH7-n122">122</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Congress, also, resolved to provide a solution for removing undesirable coppers from circulation and proposed a full weight coin of 157.5
                  grains, the same Federal standard to which <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> adhered.<ref target="#CH7-n123">123</ref> These new coppers
                  were heavier than the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> standard of 150 grains, the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> standard at 144
                  grains, and significantly greater than the <name type="place">Vermont</name> standard of 111 grains. Since 100 of the new coins were to pass
                  for the Spanish milled dollar, they could technically be called "cents." Petitions were received early in 1787 by Congress from both <name
                     type="pname">Matthias Ogden</name>, who was involved in the <name type="place">Rahway</name> mint, and <name type="pname">James
                     Jarvis</name>, who had a controlling interest in the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> Company for Coining Coppers, to obtain the
                  contract to mint this proposed copper coinage. However, by devious means, <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> had already secured the privilege
                  for his newly organized company by offering a $10,000 bribe to <name type="pname">Colonel William Duer</name>. In the meanwhile, <name
                     type="pname">Jarvis</name> had received 12,809 pounds of federally owned copper from <name type="pname">Duer</name> and later an additional
                  35 tons even prior to Congressional authorization for his project. The Federal contract coinage manufactured by <name type="pname"
                     >Jarvis</name> was the Fugio cent, the first official coin of the <name type="place">United States</name> government. Of the 300 tons of
                  Fugio coinage <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> agreed to produce, only 400,000 pieces, or about four long tons, were delivered by May
                     1788.<ref target="#CH7-n124">124</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> was unsuccessful in arranging acceptable financing and as the project faltered, he departed for <name
                     type="place">England</name> to enlist the assistance in the project of <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>, owner of the Soho mint in
                     <name type="place">Birmingham</name>. In the end, much of the copper intended for the Fugio coinage was fraudulently diverted into the
                  production of an unauthorized 3,500,000 1787 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, since the mint was simultaneously striking both
                  types.</p>
               <p>It is speculated that the Fugio cents may have been produced at sites other than <name type="place">New Haven</name>, but this is disputed.
                  The suggestion that "Club Rays Fugios" came from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> after the regular Fugio coinage ceased is not
                     feasible.<ref target="#CH7-n125">125</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Spilman</name> suggests that the Club Ray varieties were manufactured later than the more common and better executed Fine
                  Rays issues, but by a different party who possessed less technical skills.<ref target="#CH7-n126">126</ref> The "round" Club Rays <pb n="197"
                  /> and the rarer "concave" Club Rays fall into two distinct weight groups, the latter being distinctly heavier (see Table 21). Since it was
                  the practice of the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> organization to produce coppers which were lighter in weight than the genuine
                  article, it would be inconsistent to ascribe the Club Rays to that mint since as a group, they are heavier or equal to the Fine Rays
                     varieties.<ref target="#CH7-n127">127</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Spilman</name> postulates that <name type="pname">Benjamin Buell</name> produced the Club Rays, having damaged the obverse
                  working hub from which subsequent defective dies were produced. <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name>, the engraver for both the <name
                     type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Fugio</name> series, was apprehensive about the mint's illegal activities, and
                  therefore, departed for <name type="place">England</name>. His anxiety was well founded since he had earlier suffered one ear to be cropped
                  due to a forgery conviction.<ref target="#CH7-n128">128</ref>

               <p>To make a bad situation worse, the Federal government was unable to place their 400,000 new cents into circulation and sold them in bulk to a
                  speculator. Although the legislation of October 16, 1786, which provided for copper coinage, gave it legal tender status, this provision must
                  have been rescinded or else the Fugios would never have been dumped in such an unorthodox manner by the government.<ref target="#CH7-n130"
                     >130</ref> If they had been receivable for taxes, they would have enjoyed the same popularity as the legal tender <name type="place">New
                     Jersey</name> coppers. The man who purchased the Fugio consignment was Royal Flint of <name type="place">New York City</name>, who received
                  them in June 1789, just prior to the Coppers Panic. Flint was unable to dispose of his newly acquired coppers and landed in debtors' prison
                  when he couldn't meet his obligations. Fortunately for present day numismatists, a keg of new Fugio cents was uncovered in the Bank of <name
                     type="place">New York</name> in 1856 and again rediscovered in 1926. One hypothesis is that the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>,
                  aware of some implicit legal tender status, obtained the unwanted Fugios for investment purposes in anticipation of a quick profit which never

               <p>The 1787 IMMUNIS <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> coppers have stimulated recent research about their origin. Originally they were thought
                  to have been the patterns presented to Congress in 1787 by <name type="pname">Matthias Ogden</name> in his petition for the federal contract
                  coinage ultimately awarded to the Fugio contractors.<ref target="#CH7-n136">136</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Hodder</name> studied the die emission sequence and found that the series was minted over a period of time from late in
                  1788 to mid-1789, therefore, the coinage was too late to have participated in negotiations for the Federal contract.<ref target="#CH7-n137"

                  belongs to this or a later period.<ref target="#CH7-n139">139</ref> It is of particular interest that this storecard comes in two weights, a
                  heavy version from 164 to 233 grains, and a thin planchet at 108 grains. This distinction will be discussed in the following chapter. For the
                  most part, these miscellaneous coppers are primarily of numismatic and historical interest with little contemporary economic impact.</p>

               <head>SILVER COINAGES</head>
               <p>Two silver coinages were current during the Confederation period, both issued privately by <name type="place">Maryland</name> silversmiths.
                  Cut Spanish eight reales were the usual small change silver currency of the period but this money was unreliable in weight. The eight reales
                  piece may not have been divided evenly to start, and then the individual sections, of whatever size, could have been honestly worn or
                  fraudulently clipped. <name type="pname">John Chalmers</name> of <name type="place">Annapolis</name> received this lightweight and cut Spanish
                  silver which he recoined into threepence, sixpence, and shilling denominations dated 1783.<ref target="#CH7-n140">140</ref> There is little
                  documentation about the conduct of this operation. In 1783, the Spanish milled dollar weighed 417.6 grains but the fineness was now .9028, the
                  reduction having occurred in 1772. This standard still passed in <name type="place">England</name> for 54d., sterling, or in <name
                     type="place">Maryland</name> for seven and one-half local shillings (90d.). The <name type="place">Maryland</name> money of account
                  shilling would then be equivalent to 55.68 grains of .9028 fine silver. While the average weight of the <name type="pname">Chalmers</name>
                  shilling is 54.0 ¬± 2.9 grains,<ref target="#CH7-n141">141</ref> the metal was alloyed with more copper since analysis of the silver content is
                  in the 81 to 86% range, thereby providing <name type="pname">Chalmers</name> with about an 8% gross profit on the transaction.<ref
                     target="#CH7-n142">142</ref> It would appear that <name type="pname">Chalmers</name> provided a community service by removing <pb n="200"/>
                  cut and worn Spanish silver from circulation and providing a current substitute, although at "a considerable advantage to himself."<ref
                     target="#CH7-n143">143</ref> The reverse design on this coin evokes much interest depicting two birds fighting over a worm while a serpent
                  is behind the hedge waiting his chance to devour the pair of them. The allegory was an admonition to the citizens not to squabble over trifles
                  lest the Federal government, the snake, absorb them all. The series was obviously well received as evidenced by the number of well-worn
                  survivors and the fact that lightweight counterfeits have been reported.<ref target="#CH7-n144">144</ref> The shilling dies failed early with
                  many specimens showing a weak obverse center despite a bold periphery and good weight. <name type="pname">Chalmers</name> obviously gained
                  indirectly from the advertising of his establishment on the coins' labels.</p>

               <p>The summary of the specific copper coins minted in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> during the Confederation period is now complete. The list
                  includes some 693 die varieties or combinations of coppers produced from 1785 to 1789 or into 1790.<ref target="#CH8-n1">1</ref> Some of the
                  questions raised in the Preface of this book can now be examined. Why was the copper coinage short-lived and why did it fail?</p>
               <p>Earlier chapters have described how hard money in the Colonies and Confederation, although available at a price, was never abundant except for
                  a short time after the Revolution. Reasons for periodic shortages of specie coin have been proposed and the response of the American colonists
                  with hard money substitutes narrated. Whereas the majority of silver and gold coins was Spanish, Portuguese, and French, the prevalent copper
                  medium was English since it could be exported without restrictions. The monetary value of such English coppers was about double the worth of
                  the intrinsic metal content, a margin which extended an open invitation to counterfeiters. The risks of serious legal consequences if
                  convicted for duplicating regal coppers were insignificant when compared to the potential gain. The need for circulating coppers as small
                  change and money for the common people in both <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> invited unscrupulous
                  individuals to fabricate lightweight counterfeit halfpence, a practice rampant since the institution of regal copper coinage and one that
                  reached its peak in the reign of <name type="pname">George III</name>. During this one hundred or more years, countless English coppers, both
                  genuine and fake, were exported to the colonies where there was certainly no shortage. In fact, this plethora of counterfeit coppers damaged
                  commerce both in <name type="place">Great Britain</name> and the Colonies, cheated the public, and undermined confidence in the copper medium.
                  In 1754 appeals were directed to the English government by distressed butchers, bakers, and grocers of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>
                  complaining they were burdened with large numbers of essentially unnegotiable and unwanted coppers they could not spend since coppers were
                  unacceptable for taxes and could not be used except for small transac- <pb n="204"/> tions.<ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref> Domestic violence was
                  provoked in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> in 1741, and in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in 1753, when the public reacted to
                  large volumes of false coppers in circulation since the excess of small change depressed the exchange rate at which merchants would received
                     them.<ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref> Nonetheless, the current coppers of that period, genuine and counterfeit English halfpence, continued to
                  pass in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> according to the rates listed in Table 11 for the next 34 years.</p>
               <p>Further protests against the counterfeit halfpence were recorded in the Proclamation of July 14, 1781, from the Supreme Executive Council of
                     <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> "prohibiting public officials from accepting base metal counterfeit British halfpence and
                  recommending that the populace refuse them."<ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref> In 1786, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> residents were
                  warned of the counterfeit lightweight coppers arriving with each ship from <name type="place">England</name> and the damaging effect on
                  commerce "yet shameful as it certainly is, this inundation of base metal is passed with impunity and indifference."<ref target="#CH8-n5"
                     >5</ref> Another newspaper account that year estimated that "nearly one half of the copper coin in this country for twenty or thirty years"
                  were <name type="place">Birmingham</name> counterfeits which passed "for the same value as those which are genuine."<ref target="#CH8-n6"
                     >6</ref> Coins recovered from hoards contain generous portions of counterfeit English halfpence.<ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The public indifference toward counterfeit coppers began to give way to indignation and concern when from 1785 to 1787, several state
                  legislatures authorized coinages of specific weight to replace the sundry English counterfeits, tokens, and other lightweight issues. While
                  the intent was noble, the plan did not work. The quality of the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers declined over the years as
                  clandestine mints flourished. Although the authorized three million coppers from <name type="place">New Jersey</name> were frequently up to
                  the 150 grain standard, later issues were light, particularly when <name type="place">New Jersey</name> designs were struck over existing
                  underweight coins. <name type="place">Vermont</name>, although outside the Confederation as an independent republic, produced coppers
                  considerably lighter at a 111 grain standard which doubtlessly circulated outside its boundaries. Many <name type="place">Vermont</name>
                  coppers were overstruck on heavier <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers, so no fraud was perpetrated. The <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> mint essentially went bankrupt since it could not afford to produce quality coinage without incurring losses. In
                  summary, all the coinage schemes to eradicate spurious halfpence and thereby revitalize the circulating copper medium eventually failed. In
                  several instances counterfeit state issues were manufactured which were equally inferior in quality to the glut of lightweight coppers the
                  legal mints were created to replace.</p>
               <p>Despite occasional protests about lightweight coppers, the public remained relatively unconcerned about the composition of this token money
                  until early 1787. In that summer, merchants in <name type="place">New Jersey</name> received copper halfpence from 24 to 30 to the shilling,
                  depending on locality.<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> After July 20, 1787, only <name type="place">New Jersey</name> and <name type="place"
                     >United States</name> coppers would be current in that state which would continue to pass at the official rate of 15 per local shilling.
                  Effective August 1, 1787, the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> legislature outlawed all coppers less than 145.8 grains, and <pb n="205"/>
                  devalued all others from a rate of 14 to 20 per <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling. A Newport, <name type="place">Rhode
                  Island</name>, report of August 13, 1787, confirmed that all coppers, except <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place">Bungtowns</name>
                  </hi>, were fixed to pass by law in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> at 160 to the dollar, that is 20 to the <name type="place">New
                     York</name> shilling of account. In <name type="place">New Jersey</name> the accepted rate was 180 to the dollar for non-local coppers, or
                  24 to the local shilling, while in <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> the par remained at 18 to the <name type="place">New England</name>
                  shilling, or 108 for a dollar.<ref target="#CH8-n9">9</ref> Public confidence in copper as a token coinage, which had allowed it to pass at
                  about twice intrinsic value for all these years, had started to erode. The downward spiral, once begun, was destined to demonetize practically
                  all coppers in the Coppers Panic of 1789, even during the time of a significant postwar depression and extreme hard money shortage. The
                  emotional sentiment against coppers must have been extreme to have caused people practically to have abandoned this medium at a time when all
                  other money was so scarce.</p>
               <p>An understanding of the Coppers Panic of 1789, when coppers declined in value and ceased to circulate, requires a detailed analysis of the
                  copper medium of the period. The various coinages have been described in the preceding chapters. These were token or fiduciary coinages in
                  that their metallic content was worth about half the monetary value. This was never the case with gold and silver where intrinsic and monetary
                  values were equal. Copper coin was so expensive to mint in comparison to its pecuniary value that the practice developed in the English mint
                  whereby the cost of manufacture was included in the monetary value of the copper coinage.<ref target="#CH8-n10">10</ref> Even at that, the
                  minter had a substantial profit margin which encouraged counterfeiting. The acceptance of such token coinage was regulated by law and
                  succeeded only because of public confidence in the monetary system. At times in history when there was a shortage of small change, "ordinary
                  folk ... cared nothing about either intrinsic value, high quality of copper, pattern [design] or limits of legal tender."<ref
                     target="#CH8-n11">11</ref> But when commerce was flooded with coppers of inferior quality and intrinsic worth well below the regulated
                  standard, public approval in this token system had to have faltered for this money to fall into disrepute.</p>
               <p>The questions can be appropriately asked, how and why did this lack of faith in circulating tokens take place? Who suffered the most from this
                  excessive copper medium which was primarily composed of underweight counterfeit British halfpence with an assortment of new state issues, many
                  of which fell below the authorized standard? Was it the farmer or laborer who cared about the deficiencies in the intrinsic weight or purity
                  of copper coins? It is unlikely that such aesthetic considerations ever bothered the common people; their only interest was whether they could
                  spend their hard-earned coppers at the established rate and not be forced to accept less. Merchants, on the other hand, had much more reason
                  to worry about the condition of the copper currency since large numbers of lightweight coins could accumulate very quickly in their coffers
                  such that their profits could become tied up in unspendable, undesirable money. The potential in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> was similar
                  to the situation described in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> in 1754 when merchants complained about the quantities of virtually
                  unnegotiable counterfeit coppers with which they were burdened. It was the merchant class that was most prone to be inconvenienced from an
                  excess of copper and it was this class that had the greater influence with the state assemblies and newspapers, and thereby could mold public
                  opinion and public approval. The urban poor, however, just wanted fair exchange for their token coppers, while rural farmers, as a group,
                  lived at more of a subsistance level so that money was of less importance. At the height of the Coppers Panic, some editorialists hastened to
                  spread the word to the "farmers and industrious <pb n="206"/> poor" that coppers were devaluated and warned them of the situation lest they be
                  victimized by unscrupulous "vermin."<ref target="#CH8-n12">12</ref> Other reports specifically stated that "many of the merchants and
                  shop-keepers ... have large sums by them of this coin, by which they will be great sufferers." Thus it appears that from a generic viewpoint,
                  business interests stood the most to lose on account of the accumulation of a defective copper medium and the most to gain from its regulation
                  and improvement. But on a more personal level, the "poorer class of citizens" were most affected by the devaluation of coppers since "many ...
                  had their little all invested in this most uncertain of all human possessions ... a fluctuating medium."<ref target="#CH8-n13">13</ref>

               <head>WEIGHT ANALYSIS OF CONFEDERATION COPPERS</head>
               <p>Table 21 enumerates the various coppers known to have circulated during the Confederation period and their theoretical and observed weights.
                  This table was constructed from almost 4,300 specimens listed in several auction sales, fixed price lists, and from institutional and private
                     collections.<ref target="#CH8-n14">14</ref> The assignment of the manufacturing mint follows the conventions accepted by several
                  authorities, although these designations are not universally recognized and are subject to change based on newer research.<ref
                     target="#CH8-n15">15</ref> The first standard deviation, a sensitive measurement of the dispersion of values around the mean, was
                  calculated for all averages to determine whether the observed weights of the coins approached, within limits of error, the authorized
                  standard. Comparisons in the observed weights and the standards were made between the various coinages in Charts 2 to 4.</p>
               <p>In this gravimetric analysis of Confederation coppers, a wide weight range exists even within the same variety of coin. This lack of
                  uniformity reflects imperfect quality control in planchet manufacture, particularly with regard to the thickness to which the planchet stock
                  was rolled; coins cut from a thicker fillet would obviously be heavier. Planchet diameters could vary naturally since all these coins were
                  struck without collars. Overstruck and double struck coppers are characteristically greater in diameter since they have been subjected to the
                  deforming pressure of the press more than once. As a general statement, the more rudimentary the conditions of planchet preparation the
                  greater the weight range and the less uniformity. In Table 21, the disparity in coin weights is expressed by the value of the first standard
                  deviation; the lesser consistency in weight of the coppers in a particular series, the greater the first standard deviation. From Table 21,
                  the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence, group 19a, have the smallest first standard deviation, and the most obvious explanation for
                  this consistency was the better manufacturing technology available at the Tower Mint. Despite these improved conditions at the Royal Mint,
                  there was still quite a variation in uniformity; <name type="pname">Peck</name> listed a range of 140.9 to 167.9 grains for regal copper
                  halfpence minted between the years 1770 and 1775.<ref target="#CH8-n16">16</ref> While overweight silver and gold planchets of the period were
                  individually reconciled prior to striking as evidenced by file adjustment marks, it would have been ridiculous to have expended such efforts
                  on the copper medium. The question appropriately arises about acceptable tolerances in the manufacture of these coppers. Referring again to
                  the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence, the royal warrant addressed the "small errors as may happen in and by the unequal sizing of
                  the Bars which errors you shall endeavour <pb n="207"/> that they be not in Excess &amp; Defect above the 30th Part of a Pound Weight (i.e.
                  3.33%) and this not by Design but only by accident...."<ref target="#CH8-n17">17</ref> Acceptable variations for <name type="pname">George
                     II</name> coppers were "up to one-fortieth in the pound avoirdupois" or 2 1/2%.<ref target="#CH8-n18">18</ref> While the royal authority
                  recognized the potential for some discrepency in the weight of individual coppers, it was clearly expected that the average weight of the
                  entire series would adhere to the warrant specifications. Although minting procedures have advanced over the years, the process is not yet
                  perfect, since as late as the most recent halfpence of <name type="pname">Elizabeth II</name> with an authorized standard of 87.5 grains, the
                  average weight was 87.38 grains and the range varied from 84.7 to 89.2 grains.<ref target="#CH8-n19">19</ref> Coppers from the Confederation
                  mints would be expected to show a greater tolerance in weight than those contemporaneous coins from <name type="place">England</name> since
                  quality control would have been less well developed in the late eighteenth century <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. In the previous chapter
                  it was proposed that a 5% deviation from the standard would be acceptable for Confederation coppers considering the problems inherent in
                  rolling the planchet stock to the exact thickness. The best American pieces, as a group, were from the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>
                  mint, although some individual <name type="place">New Jersey</name> issues showed good consistency.</p>

               <head>CONDITION GRADE VERSUS WEIGHT</head>
               <p>At first thought, one might query how coins in varying conditions of wear can be considered and averaged in the same group. The fact is that
                  the ravages of usual circulation do not appreciably reduce the coin's weight. <name type="pname">Spilman</name> reported a loss of 6.84% for
                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence recovered from archaeological digs at <name type="place">Colonial Williamsburg</name> when
                  compared to a standard derived from uncirculated specimens.<ref target="#CH8-n20">20</ref> Frequently the state or grade of a coin is a
                  reflection of its manufacture rather than wear per se. This circumstance is well illustrated by <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>
                  imitation halfpence where the dies were shallowly engraved on purpose to simulate wear, although the specimens may have seen little actual
                  circulation. Uncirculated <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers may show significant weakness in the design because of die preparation
                  whereas mint condition <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> coppers may show exquisite detail because of high quality dies and planchets,
                  and uniform striking. "The grading of early copper state coins is very subjective, for there is no way to differentiate light wear from light
                  striking in many instances."<ref target="#CH8-n21">21</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The most accurate weight analysis would require uncirculated specimens. Except for certain series where hoards have been recovered, namely the
                  Fugio cents and the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence, such data are not available. Since we must work with the circulated
                  specimens available to us, the logical question arises, by how much does normal wear reduce a coin's mint weight? This complex problem was
                  addressed in regard to <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> imitation halfpence where three lots of coppers, grouped according state of
                  preservation, were compared as to weight, range of weight, and the first standard deviation (Table 19). The data derived from the <name
                     type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> imitation halfpence suggest that at least for this series, coppers of different grades, as long as there
                  are no obvious planchet flaws or corrosion, can be included together in weight analysis since there is not enough metal lost in average wear
                  to create any substantial difference. The average values in Table 19 are all in statistically significant agreement with each other, even if
                  the "Fine" category of only 12 specimens is omitted.</p>

                  <head>Analysis of Table 21</head>
                  <p>Table 21 is important since it is descriptive of the surviving Confederation coppers which at one point in our history circulated as the
                     small change medium of our forebears. Whatever theoretical errors may exist between these samples and the "true" average mint weight, a
                     value which can never be known for certain but only inferred, the coins being measured today <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the circulating
                     coppers of the period which were rejected for the most part by the public during the Coppers Panic. Even at their best, these coppers were
                     only a token coinage minted at a profit to someone. To add insult to injury, counterfeiters of even lighter weight coppers made further
                     gains at public expense. Because of inequities in exchange rates, there were periods in our history when importers of both regal and
                     illegal money could turn a quick profit when such coppers were transported to the colonies in bulk. Eventually, the state legislatures
                     responded to this situation and endeavored to provide a reliable, fit copper coinage, the currency of the poor and disadvantaged classes.
                     The degree to which these state issues achieved their authorized weights was in some part an index of reliability and public trust in these
                     new coppers which were projected to correct all the past evils which had plagued the medium. Some of the coppers were more successful than
                     others in fulfilling this goal, but ultimately all failed the test of public confidence in July 1789, when the Coppers Panic occurred. The
                     following three bar graphs summarize the weight analyses of Table 21 by indicating how well the Confederation coinages, both legal and
                     spurious, conformed to their respective legal standards. Considering the imperfect technology available for planchet preparation, a five
                     percent error was probably within the limits of acceptable tolerance.</p>

                  <p>Besides the contemporary economic implications of proper weight coins as indicated in Table 21, there are also some interesting numismatic
                     considerations. Weight comparisons of specific coppers provide morphological evidence that certain mintmasters strove to maintain legal
                     weight requirements whereas others, whose coppers fell well below legal requirements, were motivated "to milk the system" for personal
                     advantage. The other consideration is that fillet rolling and planchet preparation in these early mints were quite primitive and the
                     finished products were inconsistent in weight. It could well be that the occurrence of heavy coppers was not always an indication of
                     altruism on part of the mintmaster to give full measure, but rather his inability to roll the copper stock to the desired dimension. The
                     greater the value of the first standard deviation, the greater the inconsistency in planchet weight and, by inference, the less
                     sophisticated the technology of flan production. The weight distributions of the Confederation coppers from Table 21, with a sufficient
                     number of specimens in the sample for meaningful analysis, are shown in Appendix 4. These curves give a visual representation of the
                     mintmasters' ability to cut uniform planchets as an overall indication of their fillet rolling expertise. In several instances, coppers,
                     which otherwise have been considered related varieties, are now seen to differ in average planchet weight suggesting that they were not
                     struck on flans of the same fabric. Without a complete planchet composition analysis, such a finding is difficult to interpret except to
                     state that a difference has been identified.</p>
                  <p>Table 21 was constructed having recorded the weights of each individual copper variety available from the numismatic literature. When
                     similar varieties or types were identified, they were combined as groups, or subgroups, such that 60 final categories emerged within 26
                     major <pb n="214"/> groupings. Column A lists the authorized standard for the particular issue under consideration. Column B gives the
                     average weight and the first standard deviation which accounts for 68.26% of the specimens within each sample. Column C lists the number of
                     specimens examined but those with 15 or less are included for interest only. Those coinages are marked in Column D with an "EX" when their
                     average weights exceeded the standard listed in Column A, with a "W" when the standard falls within the first standard deviation of the
                     average, and a "B" when the first standard deviation of the average falls below the standard. Using these criteria, eight American coinages
                     exceed the limits of the authorized standard (EX), 21 are within range of the standard by their first standard deviation (W), and 18 are
                     clearly below the standard (B). Column E notes the percentage and direction of variance of the average in Column B from the standard in
                     Column A. The 21 groups which fall within range of their standard (W) are collectively an average of 3.4% below their authorized weights,
                     while those 18 categories which are below their respective standards (B), as a group are deficient in weight by an average of 16.5%. These
                     calculations indicate that the proposed 5% tolerance suggested as a remedy for the Confederation mintmasters is a reasonable figure since
                     16 of the 21 groups within the range of the standard fall within this estimate.</p>
                  <p>The first standard deviation values reported in Table 21 indicate the consistency in planchet weights within the respective coinages. The
                     lower the value, the less variation in flan manufacture which infers a more technologically sophisticated operation. The potential flaw in
                     this analysis is that certain varieties, <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers in particular, may have been struck over an extended
                     period of time and by one or more mints.</p>
                  <p>The most uniform coinage, as determined by the lowest value for the first standard deviation, is the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>
                     halfpence from the Tower Mint. The other copper of English manufacture with good consistency in planchet weight is the 1785 <name
                        type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> token. When this issue was the host coin for several <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and
                        <name type="place">Vermont</name> varieties, groups 16e, 18b, and 21b, the low first standard deviation is again reflected. The 1783
                        <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name>, group 25a, showed much greater weight variation suggesting less quality control for that
                     particular year. The 1783 issues are rarely seen overstruck. Those coppers with a first standard deviation ranging from six to ten grains
                     include the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents and half-cents, many <name type="place">Rahway</name> issues, the <name
                        type="pname">Bailey</name>
                     <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers, and the <name type="place">Vermont</name> 1786 bust issues. The <name type="pname"
                        >Maris</name> 67-v variety, a coin attributed to the 1788 <name type="place">Morristown</name> mint, has one of the most consistent
                     planchet weights.</p>
                  <p>Coppers with a first standard deviation from 10 to 14 grains include most of the other legal Confederation issues, the <name type="pname"
                        >Machin's Mills</name> counterfeit halfpence, and several issues from <name type="place">New Jersey</name> and <name type="place"
                        >Connecticut</name> which fall below the standard. The first standard deviation for most lightweight counterfeits is above 14 grains
                     showing little regard for the statutory standard, poor technique for planchet manufacture, or both.</p>
                  <p>Group 1 contains data for the Fugio series from the <hi rend="italic">Colonial Newsletter</hi> database. All three subgroups are within the
                     range of the 157.5 grain standard but there is a much heavier subgroup of 19 specimens, the "concave end" Club Rays, the average of which
                     exceeds the standard at 162.0 grains. The Fugio Fine Rays and the residual "round end" Club Rays varieties are statistically lighter than
                     the "concave end" group. From a numismatic perspective, the "concave end" Club Rays may have been heavier because the minter was unable to
                     obtain sheet copper of the proper thickness to match the planchet cutter.<ref target="#CH8-n22">22</ref> The other possibility is that
                     these varieties were minted in a facility which had a regard for the legal standard and exceeded it. The suggestion that the Club Rays,
                     particularly the "concave end" varieties, are a <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> product is untenable, since the output from that
                     facility was always lighter than the coppers they imitated. This is well demonstrated by the various known <name type="pname"
                     >Machin</name>'s issues examined elsewhere in this table. It is possible that these three styles of Fugios, the Fine Rays and both Club
                     Rays varieties are all from separate sources or at least minted under different circumstances.</p>
                  <pb n="215"/>
                  <p>Fugio coppers were also studied extensively by <name type="pname">Douglas</name> who measured their weights as individual groups for each
                     of the varieties available to him.<ref target="#CH8-n23">23</ref> The average weight of the complete sample of 1,810 specimens was 149.4
                     grains, while that for the 1,639 uncirculated specimens from the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> hoard, which included only
                     eight varieties, was 149.2 grains, values which are in excellent agreement with Table 21. The average weight for each group of these eight
                     uncirculated varieties showed a spread of only three grains from 148 to 151 grains, or a variation of ¬± 1%, demonstrating excellent quality
                     control in manufacture. However, the average weight of 149.2 grains for the entire lot of uncirculated coins fell 8.3 grains, or 5.3%,
                     short of the 157.5 grain standard, perhaps outside any existing remedy. The fact that the Fugio coinage was lightweight may have provided
                     another cause of anxiety for <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and an additional reason for <name type="pname">Buell</name> to have
                     retreated to <name type="place">England</name>. The weight distribution curve constructed by <name type="pname">Douglas</name> shows a
                     single peak at about 147.5 grains with the first standard deviation (68.26% of all the specimens) falling approximately between 137 and 159
                     grains as roughly extrapolated from his chart. These points on <name type="pname">Douglas</name>'s distribution curve agree exactly with
                     the <hi rend="italic">CNL</hi> data which is reproduced in Chart 8, Appendix 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <name type="pname">Douglas</name> made further interesting observations about the variation in the size of the Fugio cents. He concluded
                     that the weight discrepancies were due to the uneven thickness of the copper sheets from which the planchets were cut. The variable
                     diameters were a function of unequal pressures applied by the coining press with those for double struck coins significantly greater by one
                     to two millimeters.<ref target="#CH8-n24">24</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> coppers, as a group, consistently have the finest planchets within the state series, an observation
                     familiar to numismatists. This large sample of coins in Group 2 from a state-run mint strayed 2.3% below the established standard of 157.5
                     grains but their average meets the standard within range of error.</p>
                  <p>
                     <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers are more complicated than previously imagined. The recent work by <name type="pname"
                        >Hodder</name> has demonstrated that specific die combinations were emitted sporadically over the useful life of the dies and that the
                     dates give no accurate indication as to when the coppers were actually minted.<ref target="#CH8-n25">25</ref> Since coppers of the same die
                     variety made a scattered appearance over the period from late 1786, or early 1787, into 1790, it becomes evident that workable die
                     combinations which were initiated at <name type="place">Rahway</name> under <name type="pname">Goadsby</name> and <name type="pname"
                        >Cox</name>, continued to be employed by <name type="pname">Ogden</name> in <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> after he assumed
                     operation of the defunct <name type="place">Rahway</name> venture following June 7, 1788. Certain <name type="place">Rahway</name> dies,
                     whose temporal careers can be traced by diagnostic surface injuries, were obviously used by <name type="pname">Ogden</name> in <name
                        type="place">Elizabethtown</name> after the practice of overstriking coppers began in late 1788. <name type="pname">Hodder</name>
                     demonstrates a gradual weight reduction in the non-overstruck, traceable J reverses over the life of the dies from 1786 into 1790. This
                     decrease was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the first standard deviation indicative of gradual relaxation of quality control in
                     planchet production as the average weight was diminished.<ref target="#CH8-n26">26</ref> Within the Head Left coppers (group 4b), certain
                     of the so-called "post-replevin" issues (group 4a), and the <name type="pname">Maris</name> obverse 15 family, a gradual progression toward
                     heavier planchets after June 1788, is observed which <name type="pname">Hodder</name> interprets as an improvement in quality as <name
                        type="pname">Ogden</name> made a concerted effort to return to the statutory requirement of 150 grains.<ref target="#CH8-n27">27</ref>

                  <p>The 1787-dated coppers attributed to <name type="place">Morristown</name> (group 5c) compare favorably with the standard of 150 grains but
                     differ significantly in weight from their 1788-dated (group 5d) counterparts (p = 0.024). The deterioration in quality of the 1788 <name
                        type="place">Morristown</name> output is evident not only from the data in Table 21 but also from casual inspection of the coins
                     themselves. However, the 1788 varieties are not a homogeneous group since the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 67-v variety is heavier than
                     the remaining 1788 coppers (p = 0.0029), and its lower first standard deviation suggests an improved quality planchet preparation in
                     contrast to the others of that year. These differences are sufficient to suggest that there may have been a different source for the <name
                        type="pname">Maris</name> 67-v issue. The double peak in the 1788 <name type="place">Morristown</name> distribution curve clearly
                     indicates the heavier 67-v variety (Chart 16, Appendix 4). Newer research by <name type="pname">Hodder</name> emphasizes that many coppers
                     traditionally attributed to <name type="place">Rahway</name> were actually minted by <name type="pname">Ogden</name> in <name type="place"
                        >Rahway</name> or <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> after June 1788, as indicated by the evolution of die flaws which establish a
                     sort of "genetic marker." As a result there is a continuum of coppers from <name type="place">Rahway</name> into <name type="place"
                        >Elizabethtown</name> with the passage of time and it may be inaccurate to assign particular die combinations exclusively to the <name
                        type="place">Rahway</name> mint. Group 6a comprises those "traditional" <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> coppers for which there
                     are no visually detectable host coins, but in such cases the clue to an otherwise obscure overstrike will be an increase in the usual
                     diameter. In <name type="pname">Hodder</name>'s study of the J reverse, coppers in the latest die state V, which were probably minted in
                        <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> late in 1789 into 1790, weighed 134.9 ¬± 15.3 grains, a value quite compatible with the <name
                        type="place">Elizabethtown</name> coppers on original planchets, group 6a in Table 21.</p>
                  <p>As described in great detail in Appendix 2, the only commonly encountered overstruck coins are the 1788 <name type="place">Vermont</name>
                     and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers on <name type="place">Constellatio Novas</name> (groups 16e, 18b, and 21b), the 1788
                        <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers on counterfeit Irish halfpence (group 21c), the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 to 58-n
                     triad (group 9), and those attributed to <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> (group 6b). Of practical significance is the fact that the
                     weight of the overstruck coin will be that of the host coin. All these specimens, except for <name type="place">Vermont</name> group 21b,
                     fall well below their respective standards at an average weight deficiency of 16%.</p>
                  <p>The motivation for a coiner to overstrike existing coppers could include any or all of the following three reasons: the coiner had no
                     access to virgin planchet material and was obliged to use whatever copper was available; the coiner bought up lightweight coppers to
                     overstamp with labels of a heavier authorized coinage to increase his profit margin; or, that unacceptable, or less acceptable, coppers
                     were transformed into a more negotiable currency by an identity change in a coining press. An opportunity developed after August 1, 1787,
                     for minters to procure a cheap, ready supply of potential host coins to overstrike, while increasing their profits and cheating the public,
                     when <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> demonetized all coppers under 145.8 grains. Thus, many non-negotiable coppers became available,
                     probably in bulk discounts, including the <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers and counterfeit Irish halfpence, so popular
                     at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>. Heavier coins, such as legal <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents and Fugio coppers
                     are not found as undertypes whereas lighter coppers from other sources would prove more profitable.<ref target="#CH8-n28">28</ref> As a
                     result, <name type="place">New Jersey</name> overstruck coins appear on practically every conceivable copper of the period lighter than 150
                     grains, although exceptions exist. It has been surmised that at the <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> Mint after the summer of 1789,
                        <name type="pname">Ogden</name> did not have sufficient sheet copper stock from which to cut blanks and so supplemented his supply of
                     planchets with unwanted cheap coppers which also allowed him the additional advantage of increasing his profit by the use of ready-made
                     host coins. Certainly after the summer of 1789, the time when <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers were no longer acceptable in
                        <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, and <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                     <pb n="217"/> coins were the only negotiable copper medium, there would have been a great incentive to convert all <name type="place"
                        >Connecticut</name> coppers into <name type="place">New Jersey</name> currency. Although no statement can be made as to the date of
                     manufacture, two-thirds of the overstruck coppers attributed to <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> represented in group 6b, and
                     one-half of the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 to 58-n varieties in group 9, are over <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
                     coppers.</p>
                  <p>This alchemy, whereby minters transformed lesser coppers into the more desirable <name type="place">New Jersey</name> medium, was no doubt
                     the stimulus for the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> legislative report of June 7, 1790, which advised that such overstruck coins were
                     so light that they should have passed at 45 to the shilling rather than the 15 to the shilling as established by law for full weight, pure
                     copper, <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coins.<ref target="#CH8-n29">29</ref> It is evident that the large number of lightweight,
                     overstruck <name type="place">New Jersey</name> issues undermined the credibility of legitimate coins.</p>
                  <p>The 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> overstruck coppers (group 18b) appear on <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> host
                     coins except for the rare occurrence of the counterfeit <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cent undertype as previously acknowledged
                     in group 17. The <name type="place">Vermont</name> overstruck issues from <name type="place">Rupert</name> (group 21b) were also on <name
                        type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers but in doing so, their weight standard was not violated since the average <name
                        type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coin exceeded the authorized 111 grain standard for the Republic of <name type="place"
                        >Vermont</name>. The Irish undertypes used at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> for certain 1788 <name type="place"
                        >Vermont</name> coppers (group 21c) were apparently counterfeit since their average weight is almost identical with the Irish
                     counterfeits listed in group 24. Regal Irish halfpence of the period were minted in 1766, 1769, 1774 to 1776, 1781, and 1782 at an
                     established weight of 134.6 grains.<ref target="#CH8-n30">30</ref>
                     <name type="pname">Batty</name> described a large number of Irish counterfeit halfpence of that era including 1772, 1773, and 1783, years
                     for which there were no legitimate Irish coppers.<ref target="#CH8-n31">31</ref> With such an abundance of contemporary Irish counterfeit
                     halfpence, some found their way into American minting presses.</p>
                  <p>This discussion must include the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 to 58-n clone, since by itself, 56-n is the most common coin among the

                     variety appears so frequently in the auction experience <pb n="218"/> from which this table is derived, may be due to its popularity among
                     numismatists who are attracted by the prospect of collecting the various host coins. Nonetheless, the number of survivors today supposes a
                     prodigious output of a single die combination, to say nothing of the fact that the n reverse saw further use with two other obverses.</p>
                  <p>There is debate as to whether the "camel heads" were from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> or <name type="place"
                        >Elizabethtown</name>. The arguments will not be repeated here except to state that the host coin utilization for the <name type="pname"
                        >Maris</name> 56 clone is far more characteristic of the <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> practices where all available lighter
                     weight coppers were fed into the presses. Since the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56-n dies lasted so long, it is also evident that
                     whoever struck them had the capability to anneal the host coins since if they were not softened, the dies would have long since shattered.
                     Also when a host coin was not annealed, the new dies would make very poor impressions with the old design showing through very plainly as
                     often seen in the 1788 <name type="place">Connecticuts</name> struck over <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers.<ref

                  <p>The 56-n specimens in Table 21 alone comprise 5.2% of all the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers examined. This does not even
                     address the fact that the <name type="pname">Maris</name> n reverse was even more durable than its obverse partners and accounts for over
                     6.6% of all the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> samples in the table. Although the number of "camel heads" consigned to auction is
                     inordinately large and does not represent their original proportion within the total <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coinage, it is
                     still a significant number. If we consider that there were about four million or more <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers of all
                     varieties, then at a maximum of 5.2% of the total, the original census for 56-n would be 208,000, while the n reverse would have endured
                     almost 265,000 impressions! Even half of this maximal estimate for 56-n would be 104,000, still too large an emission to have been the
                     progeny of a single die pair.</p>
                  <p>
                     <name type="pname">Spilman</name> suggested that 50,000 impressions was an excessive expectation for the Fugio die pairs.<ref

                     <name type="pname">Hodder</name> in a recent article, calculated that in 1796, less than 20,000 large cents were minted per die pair.<ref
                        target="#CH8-n35">35</ref> Even postulating that the finest current technology was available to the authors of the "camel heads," it is
                     intriguing to postulate the existence of a complex hub from which several identical <name type="pname">Maris</name>-56 dies were made and
                     used over the life of the coinage. Since coin detail can be difficult to interpret because of overstriking (only 5 of the 55 specimens did
                     not include reference to a host coin) the existence of several 56-n die pairs could be hard to prove by naked-eye examination. If this
                     notion of several completely hubbed dies is plausible, then who could have provided <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s hubbing
                        technology?<ref target="#CH8-n36">36</ref> It is safe to say that whatever facility produced this series, it possessed the capacity to
                     case-harden dies and anneal the host coins prior to overstriking or else the obverse 56 die would have long since shattered as did the
                     obverse <name type="pname">Maris</name> 58. This is in contrast to the later days at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> where the
                        <name type="place">Vermont</name> dies fractured quickly while overstriking the counterfeit Irish halfpence, group 21c.</p>
                  <p>Whatever time may reveal, the facts suggest that the 56-n variety was produced by a highly skilled artisan. The clones of 56-n, namely 57
                     and 58-n, were far fewer in number to suggest more than one obverse die but since the obverse devices on these varieties are so similar,
                     could these have been partially hubbed obverse dies which fractured earlier than <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56? So the question
                     remains, is the currently observed census of the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56-n <name type="place">New Jersey</name> copper due to an
                     original prolific output, perhaps employing more than one die pair, or is its frequency more apparent than real because of a significant
                     modern-day sampling error? This is the challenge for future research using photographic overlay techniques.</p>
                  <p>The coppers attributed to <name type="pname">Brasher</name> and <name type="pname">Bailey</name> approach the 150.0 grain standard within
                     error (group 7). The obvious counterfeits, 54-k, 80-ff, 81, 83-ii, and 84-kk (group 8) make no effort to achieve full weight.</p>
                  <pb n="219"/>
                  <p>The weight analyses of <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers reveal some interesting results. Since the average weight for each of
                     the first three types from the Company for Coining Coppers (1785 Mailed Bust Right, 1785 Mailed Bust Left, and 1786 Mailed Bust Left) fall
                     within 1.9 grains of each other, these types are combined. As a composite group (10a) of 294 specimens, their average is 135.3 ¬± 11.2
                     grains which falls barely within the range of error of the 144.0 standard. It is unlikely that these underweight coppers were a contrived
                     deception by the newly franchised mint to increase their profit margins, but rather represented a technical problem due to the inability to
                     roll the copper fillets to the required dimensions. A decrease of only 0.10 millimeter in the thickness of the copper sheets, the thickness
                     of a single sheet of paper, could account for this weight reduction. When the new style Draped Bust Left coppers was introduced in 1786
                     (group 10b), the average weight exceeded the standard. This increase could have represented an improvement in rolling technology, since
                     from this point on, the Company for Coining Coppers produced standard weight coins. The historical event which coincides with this
                     appearance of typically full weight coppers, was the six week period starting September 10, 1786, when the Company for Coining Coppers had
                     exhausted their supply of copper and leased their equipment to the group of <name type="pname">Mark Leavenworth</name>, <name type="pname"
                        >Isaac Baldwin</name>, and <name type="pname">William Leavenworth</name> who are considered responsible for the 1786 Draped Bust Left
                        issues.<ref target="#CH8-n37">37</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 1787 Draped Bust Left (large letters) in group 10c, and the 1787 Mailed Bust Left in group 10d, both from the Company for Coining
                     Coppers, cannot be distinguished from each other by weight and compare favorably with the legal requirement. The remaining 1787 Draped Bust
                     Left issues, identified by their smaller letters in the legends, are attributed by <name type="pname">Breen</name> to their successors in
                     business, <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company (group 11). The 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers of group 11 are not a homogeneous
                     population; the first of these exceptions, group 11b, are those with the g, BB, CC, FF, and GG reverses, comprising <name type="pname"
                        >Miller</name> 17-g.3, 18-g.1, 19-g.4, 21-DD, 22-g.2, 24-g.3, 24-g.5, 24-FF, 38-GG, 45-CC, 46-BB, and 48-g.5.<ref target="#CH8-n38"
                        >38</ref> These varieties all have crosses on both the obverse and reverse except for 48 which has obverse fleurons. When the average
                     weight of this group 11b is compared statistically with the larger group 11a, the "cross" group 11b differs significantly from the
                     remainder of its Draped Bust Left colleagues of group 11a (p = &lt;0.0001). The "cross" group exceeds the 144.0 grain standard whereas
                     group 11a is deficient by 6.5%.</p>
                  <p>There is a second subset represented in group 11c consisting of <name type="pname">Miller</name> 34, 36, 37, 39, and 56 with "fleurons" on
                     the reverse (e, h, i, k, 1, cc, ee, ff, HH, and RR). Many of these varieties also have an R substituted for a missing B in LIB in the
                     reverse legend. When isolated and examined separately from the 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers of group 11a, this group, 11c, tips the scale
                     at 142.0 ¬± 11.6 grains, which is a highly significant increase over group 11a (p = &lt;0.0001). The remaining Draped Bust Left issues
                     represented in group 11a are by far the most common <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers. These issues are characterized by the
                     presence of cinquefoils in the legends, a design shared with the Fugio coppers which were minted by the same organization. The weight
                     analysis of these 1787 Draped Bust Left <name type="place">Connecticut</name> issues is displayed in Charts 19 to 22, Appendix 4.</p>
                  <p>It is entirely possible that the punctuation of <name type="place">Connecticut</name> legends is a code which indicates some circumstance
                     within the minting process. <name type="pname">Breen</name> has suggested that the different ornamentation identifies the "workmen who
                     completed the dies from <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s hubs."<ref target="#CH8-n39">39</ref> The emission sequence of the 1787 Draped
                     Bust Left series has four separate cycles, beginning with the large lettered issues from the Company for Coining Coppers. These are next
                     followed by those coppers with small letters from <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company with crosses in the legends, then fleurons,
                     and lastly <pb n="220"/> by those with cinquefoils, a design shared with the Fugios.<ref target="#CH8-n40">40</ref> The first three
                     emissions are of good weight, whereas the last and largest is deficient. It is not as though <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company
                     lacked the technology to set the proper roller spacing, since they minted Fugio coppers at 150 grains. It would appear that this weight
                     reduction for the last Draped Bust Left issues was quite purposeful. The final Draped Bust Left production in 1788 using <name type="pname"
                        >Buell</name>'s hubs (group 17), probably from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>, is very much lighter on average than any of
                     their earlier counterparts.</p>
                  <p>Groups 12 to 14 represent contemporary counterfeits illegally minted and the lower weight values are anticipated. Group 12 contains the
                     1786 Mailed Bust Right coppers traditionally attributed to <name type="pname">Atlee</name>. Group 13 has been considered a product of <name
                        type="pname">Walter Mould</name> due to punch link evidence previously described. When the planchet weights of these four varieties are
                     plotted, the curve has a definite double peak, the heavier issues being the 4-L or "horned bust." These gravimetric data indicate that the
                     planchets of the so-called <name type="pname">Mould</name>
                     <name type="place">Connecticut</name> counterfeits are dissimilar and all were not cut under the same circumstances (see Chart 24, Appendix
                     4). The <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> output of 1787 (group 15) and 1788 (group 18) are only about three grains apart in average
                     weight; the 1788 <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> coppers on original planchets (group 18a) are similar in weight to their
                     overstruck varieties represented in group 18b.</p>
                  <p>Within the 1787 Triple Leaves varieties included in group 16, there is a wide variation in planchet weight as indicated by the elevation in
                     the first standard deviation. There is a heavier sub-population which has been found to consist of 11-E, 11-K, 10-E, 9-E and 2-B (16b)
                     which approach the authorized standard, whereas the remainder are significantly lighter (group 16c) and are similar to those dated 1788
                     (group 16d). See Chart 26, Appendix 4. This is very suggestive that the Triple Leaves are not a homogeneous group with certain members very
                     near the standard while others are quite deficient. The logical explanation is that they were minted under different auspices although both
                     display a wide range of planchet weights indicating difficulty in rolling the copper stock to a consistent thickness. The heavier 1787
                     Triple Leaves of 16b have been identified by <name type="pname">Breen</name> as a specific group.<ref target="#CH8-n41">41</ref> These
                     heavier varieties may have been struck independently from the lighter 1787 (group 16c) and 1788 (group 16d) varieties which are similar in
                     weight. An explanation for this observation is that <name type="pname">Benjamin Buell</name> struck coppers from his father's dies before
                     relinquishing his equipment to <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>. Possibly this weight profile is due to the fact that the full
                     weight 1787 Triple Leaves coppers were minted by <name type="pname">Buell</name> and the lighter 1787 and 1788-dated coins later came from

                  <p>
                     <name type="pname">Crosby</name> stated that the 1785 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers showed the greatest "degree of
                     regularity" in weight when compared with the other three years.<ref target="#CH8-n42">42</ref> In writing of the 1786 varieties, he added
                     that "few are found ... which do not reach the legal requirement of 144 grains." A sample of 28 coins from the Company for Coining Coppers
                     of 1785 and 1786 reported by <name type="pname">Lindesmith</name> showed that only nine coins met or exceeded 144 grains and the average of
                     all examined was 138.2 grains.<ref target="#CH8-n43">43</ref> Considering the 1787 issues <name type="pname">Crosby</name> observed that
                     "most of the mailed busts exceed the legal weight, though some fall much below it; the draped busts show less variation, few of them much
                     exceeding that required, and many of them, when slightly worn, falling a little short of it."<ref target="#CH8-n44">44</ref>

                  <p>The Tower Mint <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence (group 19a) were the most consistent of all these coinages but, of course, were

                  <p>All the <name type="place">Vermont</name> issues in Table 21 surpassed the established standard, an observation also recorded by <name

                  <p>The report of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> legislative committee of March 5, 1787, cited "<name type="place">Birmingham</name>
                     coppers," the contemporary name for counterfeit English halfpence, at 60 to the pound.<ref target="#CH8-n46">46</ref> From Table 21, the 68
                     counterfeit British halfpence in group 23 are 63.4 to the pound, at an average weight of 110.4 grains, and the <name type="pname">Machin's
                        Mills</name> imitation halfpence of group 22 are at 62.8 to the pound at an average of 111.5 grains. These low weights support the
                     committee's contention of public fraud when these lightweight counterfeits passed in commerce. The <name type="place">Constellatio
                        Nova</name> coppers (group 25) were also viewed with disfavor and mint state specimens would have weighed in the vicinity of 59 per
                     pound, again, well below the standard for <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> effective August 1, 1787, of 48 coppers to the pound.<ref
                        target="#CH8-n47">47</ref> The two varieties of <name type="place">Nova Eborac</name> coppers do not appear to be homogeneous in
                     planchet weight. The emission with the reverse figure seated to the left seems significantly heavier than the variety with its figure
                     oriented to the right. More specimens must be examined to substantiate this preliminary observation.</p>
                  <p>How can these variations in observed coin weights from the standard be interpreted and placed in perspective? First of all, the original
                     purpose of the state coinages was to provide a reliable, true, copper medium which for many years had been adulterated with lightweight
                     counterfeits of reduced intrinsic worth. Thus the challenge of the Confederation mints was to correct the fraud which, according to
                     contemporaneous reports, had bilked the public for so many years. The official expectation was that if high quality coppers of a weight
                     that people had come to expect as reasonable were made available, the public would accept only them and effectively the lightweight trash
                     would be rejected and disappear from circulation.<ref target="#CH8-n48">48</ref> To guarantee some criterion of value to the proposed
                     coinages, the various states established weight standards for coppers minted within their jurisdictions; for <name type="place"
                        >Connecticut</name> it was 144 grains of pure copper. Any deviation below this standard would mean increased profit to the contract
                     minter at public expense. Into 1788, most coppers, with the notable exceptions of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and <name
                        type="place">Vermont</name>, fell well below the authorized weights when much coining was conducted without legal franchise and
                     overstriking became common practice. Counterfeit English halfpence and <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers were never up to
                     legal measure except in <name type="place">Vermont</name>. Even though mints were authorized for the express purpose of improving the
                     quality of the small copper change, a paradoxical effect was encountered as the condition of this coinage continued to deteriorate and
                     matters worsened. The net effect was that many Confederation copper coinages deteriorated in quality over time and failed to bolster public
                     confidence in this medium. The underweight state coppers just added to the existing surplus of other essentially valueless coins whose
                     circulation came to an abrupt halt in the summer of 1789, despite the fact that the country was in a deep depression and specie was in very
                     short supply.</p>
                  <p>The important point to make is not whether a citizen of the times was satisfied with the weight or quality of a particular copper coin in
                     his pocket, but rather the entire medium was on trial. All coppers were "being painted with the same brush" and unless there was the
                     guarantee of legal redemption status, as was the case for <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers, to bolster the falling intrinsic
                     metallic worth, trust in coppers as a medium of exchange wavered. The determination of average coin weights, rather than the weight of any
                     individual copper, serves as an index of the minters' reliability and success in meeting assigned standard requirements; since obviously
                     some variation was to be expected among coppers manufactured by relatively primitive methods, the <pb n="222"/> occurence of some low
                     weight coppers is not evidence of dishonesty on the part of the minter. On the other hand, when the average weight of a large sample falls
                     below the standard, minting practices are suspect and the coinage failed to meet its objective of correcting the perceived evil of
                     underweight coppers. It is evident from contemporaneous records that public officials were sensitive when this weight obligation was not
                     realized and responded as though the public were being cheated. From a numismatic viewpoint, the achievement of the weight requisite for a
                     particular style or type of copper may also assist in identifying the mint of origin assuming that the quality of workmanship and
                     fulfillment of the weight requirement is a reflection of a particular minter's standard of practice. Similarly, an alteration in weight may
                     indicate different production methods in planchet preparation.</p>

                     <p>Other reasons were responsible for diameter variation in early coinages. In the Federal Mint, it was technically very difficult to
                        control the thickness of cold-rolled copper fillets. To compensate for this inequity in thickness and yet provide planchets of proper
                        weight, the diameters of the 1794 cents were regulated since "several sizes of cutting-out punches were used to produce copper blanks
                        near legal weight, even though the thickness [of the planchets] had not been properly controlled. This diameter variation is greater
                        than the expected variance due to striking without a collar." (<name type="pname">Williamson</name>, <hi rend="italic">Penny-Wise

                     <p>Table 21 is compiled from auction experience and collections where coin weights are listed. In many of these auctions, there was a heavy
                        representation of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers and so the frequency rate for these Confederation coppers may be subject
                        to significant sampling errors. This following list is only an approximation of the frequency for the three most common coppers followed
                        by groups of five for those issues with 15 or more representatives in Table 21. No <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> coppers
                        appear on this list but the closest ones for this distinction are the 1788 half cent, <name type="pname">Ryder</name> 1-B, with 14
                        specimens, and the 1787 "horned eagle" cent, <name type="pname">Ryder</name> 2b-A with 12. Reference is made to the article by <name

                        coppers are decidedly rarer but the presence of the <name type="place">Nova Eborac</name> was unexpected.</p>

                     <p>Since the copper medium was only a token coinage, it is difficult to conceptualize why the weight or purity of the metal made any
                        difference to the average person. As long as the money could be spent at a constant rate per shilling, any shape or description of
                        copper should have proved acceptable; therefore, for many years coppers passed "without discrimination." There had to have been some
                        compelling force which made coppers unpopular. Perhaps it originated with the merchants who could not dispose of their accumulations of
                        small change as a currency and also came to realize that these coppers even lacked value as scrap metal.</p>

               <head>PROFIT POTENTIAL FOR COPPERS</head>
               <p>If the coppers listed in Table 21 were prescribed to pass "by consent without discrimination" in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> at 14 to
                  the shilling, it is evident that the intrinsic value of the coins received in commerce would depend on the varieties of coins offered and
                  accepted, although the "token" values would be equal. Since the heaviest of the coins in Table 21 contains about 50% more copper than the
                  lightest, only public confidence in this token medium allowed such disparate coins to circulate side by side.</p>
               <p>However, the legislative report of March 5, 1787, already cited, suggests that this "public confidence" was beginning to fray. This document
                  listed the <q>... various sorts of copper coin circulating in this State, the principal whereof are, <hi rend="italic">First</hi>. A few
                     genuine British half-pence of <name type="pname">George</name> the Second, and some of an earlier date, the impressions of which are
                     generally defaced. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>. A number of Irish half-pence, with a bust on one side, and a harp on the other. <hi
                        rend="italic">Thirdly</hi>. A very great number of pieces in imitation of British half-pence, but much lighter, of inferior copper, and
                     badly executed. ‚Äî These are generally called by the name <name type="place">Birmingham</name> Coppers, as it is pretty well known that they
                     are made there, and imported in casks, under the name of <name type="pname">Hard Ware</name>, or wrought copper. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fourthly</hi>. There has lately been introduced into circulation, a very considerable number of coppers of the kind that are made in
                     the State of <name type="place">New-Jersey</name>. Many of these are below the proper weight of the <name type="place">Jersey</name>
                     coppers, and seem as if designed as a catch-penny for this market.<ref target="#CH8-n49">49</ref>

               </p>
               <p>The report is of interest in that no mention is made of genuine <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence but only the counterfeits which
                  obviously outnumbered the former, a fact to be explained later. Thus, these <name type="place">Birmingham</name> coppers are described as the
                  chief small money of the period. The lightweight <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers censured by the committee were probably the
                  so-called <name type="pname">Hatfield</name>'s counterfeits (group 8) since none of the other underweight <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                  coppers had appeared by the spring of 1787 and this <name type="pname">Maris</name> 54-k is a fairly common coin.<ref target="#CH8-n50"

               </p>
               <p>The committee report continues by making a public exposure of the excessive profits allegedly turned by those who produced the regal and
                  counterfeit English halfpence and the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers. It was estimated that a pound of suitable copper for
                  cutting into blanks would cost no more than 20d., <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> money, and that the additional expense for minting would
                  not exceed 6d., for a total cost of 26d. per pound of token copper coins. A summary of the financial disclosures presented by the committee is
                  found in Table 22 together with some corrections made for errors in their calculations. The committee acknowledged that they "have not been
                  able to <pb n="223"/> ascertain with any degree of accuracy" the "real expense of coinage." While the committee correctly quoted the cost of
                  copper, it completely overlooked the value of the reworked scissel, i.e. the remains of the copper fillet after the planchets had been cut or
                  stamped from it. For the early Federal Mint in 1791, it was reported that: <q>Copper of the best quality, in plates, may be purchased in <name
                        type="place">Europe</name> at 10 1/2 d. sterling. In cutting blanks, there will be a waste of twenty-two percent. These clippings are
                     worth 7 1/2 d. per pound; thence the blanks will cost 11 1/2 d. nearly‚Äîit may be stated at 1s. 9d. [21d.] <name type="place">New
                        York</name> money, per pound, exclusive of cutting them, which is not great, as one man can readily cut one hundred weight in a day.<ref
                        target="#CH8-n51">51</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By these figures, it would appear that the 20d., <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> money, estimated by the committee as the total cost for
                  copper was sufficient to accomodate for the loss incurred from the wastage. In the Tower Mint, about half the copper was returned to the
                  supplier for reprocessing but at the same price.<ref target="#CH8-n52">52</ref> Therefore, the final cost at the Royal Mint was only for the
                  copper actually used. At the Federal Mint in 1794, only 60% of the copper plate was consumed in manufacturing acceptable planchets, the
                  remaining scissel and imperfect or "defaced" blanks being recast into ingots to be rolled again.<ref target="#CH8-n53">53</ref> In 1795, the
                  quote to the Federal Mint per pound for copper plate of appropriate thickness was 30d. (<name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money) with the
                  offer to take back "clean copper clippings" at 14d. per pound, or a recovery of 47%.<ref target="#CH8-n54">54</ref> In a coinage proposal to
                  the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> General Court in 1786, a contractor, <name type="pname">James Swan</name>, estimated that if the
                  scissel were reworked into sheets, about 50% of its original cost could be returned, but the clippings would have to be sent to <name
                     type="place">England</name> for reprocessing "for it can't be done in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>."<ref target="#CH8-n55">55</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Production costs were significantly understated by the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Legislature. The cost of striking coppers at <name
                     type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>'s private <name type="place">Birmingham</name> mint during the period 1789 to 1792 was only 5d. per
                     pound.<ref target="#CH8-n56">56</ref> Published accounts from the Tower Mint indicated the charges for planchet preparation, moneyers,
                  engravers, and smiths was 7d. sterling (12.4d. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> money), or double the committee's estimate of 6d. The actual
                  profit for Tower Mint halfpence was stated at 10.9%, while that for the 1773 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence was 16%, excluding
                  any shipping and insurance fees to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>.<ref target="#CH8-n57">57</ref> This is a far cry from the 57% calculated
                  by the committee. Minting costs for clandestine operations producing counterfeit halfpence must have been lower than those from well regulated
                  mints with coins of standard weight and composition. Profits would have been substantially higher for a counterfeiting venture but defy
                  accurate computation. The profits for the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers were grossly misstated, with no provision made for the
                  10% franchise royalty owed to the state from the legal mints, all of which were known to have had serious financial difficulties. One
                  additional cost to the state mints which cannot be ascertained was the expense associated with placing the newly minted coins in circulation.
                  In <name type="place">England</name> those who wanted a supply of new coppers applied at the Mint where they were available in packets of five
                  and ten shilings since there was no official provision for the dissemination of freshly minted farthings and halfpence.<ref target="#CH8-n58"
                     >58</ref> The distribution network for the Confederation mints has never been studied but logic dictates that in the absence of banks and
                  sub-treasuries there must have been a system of jobbers or middlemen who might have received the new coppers at wholesale.<ref

                  the cost of minting one pound of copper at 12¬¢ (10.8d. <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money) which converts to 11.5d. <name

                     >Massachusetts</name> mint, the Tower Mint, and the Congressional contract for the cost of turning one pound of copper into regal
                  halfpence, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents and half cents, and the Fugio coppers are in good agreement with each other. These
                  values are presented in Table 23. When converted into <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> money, these sums are about double the 6d. supposed
                  by the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> committee. If the mint costs in <name type="place">New Jersey</name> were of the same order as those
                  in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, and there is little reason to suppose otherwise, the committee again made a significant
                  understatement as it did with the Tower Mint and the regal English halfpence. In <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, the initial engraver

               <p>This recalculated 22.4% profit statement differs significantly from the 54% proposed by the committee and does not include other unknown costs
                  such as cartage and distribution. A devaluation from 14 to 20 coppers per <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling would reduce the token
                  value of a pound of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers to 28.0d. and thereby turn a profit into a 14.1% loss on those coins
                  circulating in a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> jurisdiction. An exchange rate of 17 1/4 coppers to the shilling would have approached the
                  break-even point where all costs and royalties would have equaled the token value. Above a rate of nearly 31 coppers to the <name type="place"
                     >New York</name> shilling, the intrinsic value of the copper metal would have been at par with the monetary value of the coins and
                  technically these copper coins would no longer be a token or fiduciary coinage.</p>
               <p>If the franchise owners of a <name type="place">New Jersey</name> mint recovered only a 22.4% profit exclusive of any other miscellaneous
                  expenses such as interest payments, rents, bonds, insurance, distribution, loss on scissel, and cartage fees, it is understood why both the
                     <name type="place">Rahway</name> and <name type="place">Morristown</name> operations had significant financial problems. Likewise, there
                  was a distinct advantage for coiners to have engaged in producing illegal <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers which were
                  considerably lighter than the 144 grain <name type="place">Connecticut</name> standard and from which no royalties were exacted. Table 21
                  (groups 12 and 13) lists the average weights of such counterfeit <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers. If an average "mint weight" of
                  122 grains is supposed, then a recalculation of the known data in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> funds, omitting the royalties paid to the
                  State of <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, demonstrates the profit motive, 72.7% by these calculations, for minters to have entered into

               <p>The advantages of overstriking existing coins have already been described. It was common practice at the <name type="place"
                     >Elizabethtown</name> mint after June 1789, at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>, and by those responsible for the "camel head"
                  varieties (<name type="pname">Maris</name> 56-n etc.). Some estimate of the benefits accrued from overstriking can be extrapolated from our
                  current evidence. In <name type="place">New Jersey</name> after July 20, 1787, only coppers of that state and <name type="place">United
                     States</name> coppers were allowed to circulate.<ref target="#CH8-n69">69</ref> In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>
                  <pb n="228"/> all coppers lighter than 48 to the pound, 145.8 grains, were demonetized after August 1, 1787. Effectively, only <name
                     type="place">Massachusetts</name>, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, and <name type="place">Fugio</name> coppers met these
                  stipulations, all <name type="place">Connecticut</name> issues having been excluded. These monetary restrictions made an enormous number of
                  non-negotiable coppers available whose true identities could be masked by a quick pass through the coining press to imprint them with
                  acceptable <name type="place">New Jersey</name> designs. Coins thus altered could be spent in <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, where they
                  were legal tender for taxes at 15 to the local shilling, or in neighboring <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> at 20 to the shilling, the rate
                  imposed after August 1, 1787. The cost to the minter for the unwanted coppers, to use as host coins, is hard to ascertain but in a report to
                  the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> Assembly of June 7, 1790, it was quoted that 45 <name type="place">Birmingham</name> or <name
                     type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, at an average of 120 grains each, could be bought for a <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                  shilling. This would amount to 15.6d. per pound for ready-to-use planchets. Scrap copper sold for an equivalent of 10d. per pound in <name
                     type="place">Philadelphia</name>, about half the cost of rolled-planchet stock. The cost for stamping blank planchets amounted to about 12%
                  of the total minting costs at the Tower Mint so there was a considerable saving to be realized when cheap coppers were overstruck.<ref
                     target="#CH8-n70">70</ref> The availability of ready-to-strike host coins eliminated the expense and labor associated with reworking the
                  scissel. However, there was another incalculable cost for annealing the existing coins which prepared them for restamping with new labels.
                  Groups 6b and 9 from Table 21 give the average weights of the <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> overstrikes and the "camel heads." From
                  these data a "mint weight" for a hypothetical, overstruck copper of 128 grains is extrapolated to demonstrate the augmented profits of 180%
                  available from using host coins rather than original planchets. The example selected is heavier than the 120 grain specimens quoted above by
                  the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> Assembly. It is assumed that these coppers were overstruck in <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                  and passed there at the legal rate of 15 to the shilling.<ref target="#CH8-n71">71</ref>

               <p>Since many of the above numbers are only educated guesses and cannot be verified with certainty, the primary purpose of these computations is
                  to show the order of magnitude of the potential profits when minting procedures were manipulated to decrease fixed costs. As the exchange rate
                  of coppers per shilling increases, the token value of the coppers and the potential profits dwindle. Such happened in <name type="place">New
                     York</name> when the rate was advanced from 14 to 20 effective August 1, 1787. The particular overstruck issues cited above appeared after
                  that date, perhaps by the summer of 1788, but at any rate prior to the Coppers Panic. <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers overstruck
                  on lesser coins elicited official attention in the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> legislative report of June 7, 1790, which will be
                  detailed later.</p>
               <p>Primarily because of their unfamiliarity with production costs, the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Legislature's <hi rend="italic">ad
                     hoc</hi> committee on copper coinage substantially exaggerated the profits earned by the legal mints in <name type="place">England</name>
                  and <name type="place">New Jersey</name> on the manufacture of coppers, although they were correct to have concluded that counterfeit
                  operations fared very well. Motivated perhaps by this inaccurate <pb n="229"/> study, the legislature denied the petitions of <name
                     type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name> and <name type="pname">John Bailey</name> and subsequently that of <name type="pname">Captain Thomas
                     Machin</name> to supply a quantity of contract coinage for the state. Rather than facilitate more alleged windfall profits for private
                  minters, the legislature instead devalued the copper currency, thereby reducing the losses incurred to the public when they accepted this
                  inflated token medium in commerce. The devaluation occurred in the midst of a significant economic depression suggesting that public pressure
                  must have been considerable.</p>
               <p>Effective August 1, 1787, only those coppers could pass in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> which met a standard of one-third ounce (145.8
                  grains), avoirdupois, pure copper or 48 to the pound. (The regulation was probably unenforceable since it was unlikely that the public would
                  weigh its individual copper coins.) Such acceptable coppers would be current at 20 to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling instead
                  of 14, a 43% reduction in value. The new law effectively demonetized all coppers in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> except those legal
                  halfpence from the Tower Mint, which were few in numbers, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and legal <name type="place">New
                     Jersey</name> coppers, and the new Fugio cents which were supposed to adhere to the new Federal standard. This regulation, while removing
                  many lesser coppers from circulation, also encouraged mint operators to salvage their shrinking profit margins by overstriking acceptable
                  designs on non-negotiable coppers by reducing planchet weight, and by decreasing the overall quality of their coinages. The fact that so many
                     <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers were used as host coins for <name type="place">New Jersey</name> issues indicates that the
                     <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series were not well regarded in commerce in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> and <name
                     type="place">New Jersey</name> area even though such money was only slightly less than the new weight requirement.</p>
               <p>It appears that at both the state and federal levels, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> had adopted an official hard line policy to regulate
                  better the token copper medium and refrained from minting their own. Their Congressional delegation had been instructed to alter the Federal
                  standard so that the value of copper coins would equal the intrinsic value of the metal plus no more than the actual expense of minting.<ref
                     target="#CH8-n72">72</ref> The instruction was an additional attempt to close the gap between intrinsic and commercial values which would
                  discourage counterfeiting and profiteering, increase public confidence in the medium, and drive inferior coinages out of circulation.</p>

                     in 1794 are readily available, although not directly comparable to this earlier period. <name type="pname">David Rittenhouse</name>, the

                  <p>To obtain 600 lbs. in blanks, one must start with 1,000 lbs of sheet copper, the clippings from which (i.e. 400 lbs.) need to be cast over.
                     If one were to cut the sheet copper "to the best advantage," Rittenhouse stated that 700 lbs. would be available for planchets with only
                     300 lbs. wastage.</p>

                  <p>At the rate of $23.50 in mint costs and $160 in copper, $202 in coin (or actually $201.92 for a 208 grain copper cent) could be
                     manufactured which left a profit of $18.50, or a 10.1% gain. This figure agrees well with the profit quoted from the Tower Mint of 10.8%.
                     Rittenhouse quoted his 600 lbs. of copper at $160 which would figure at 26.7¬¢ a pound but it is unclear what allowance was made for the
                     salvage value of the wastage which could be recast into ingots. In 1794, the market price for copper in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
                     was about 26¬¢ a pound (25d. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> money) as per Table 24. See note 170.</p>

                     from substantial authority, that a considerable quantity of coppers have been purchased up in this town, since their depreciation, at a
                     very low price, and carried into the country, with a view of inlisting [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the unsuspicious farmer with them, at a

               <p>The financial chaos of late July and early August of 1789, caused by the collapse of circulating coppers is well described by another report
                  datelined <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> and reprinted in many localities. <q>A correspondent believes that the confusion, and consequent
                     distress occasioned by the sudden stoppage to the circulation of copper coins, are subjects that call for the immediate attention of
                     authority: The poorer class of citizens are particularly affected by this circumstance, many of whom had their little <hi rend="italic"

               <p>The preceding commentary describes an almost complete cessation of circulation of coppers and subsequent damage to many small businesses and
                  the poor. The disaster occurred during an exceptionally hot spell of weather in August 1789, when the temperature was so oppressive that
                  "several shop keepers have shut up their shops and retired to the country for a few days."<ref target="#CH8-n78">78</ref> In <name
                     type="place">Philadelphia</name>, "the thermometer stood at 96 for several days," "deaths are numerous," and "all the meat in the market
                  [was] carried away and thrown into the <name type="place">Delaware</name>" because it "was in a state of putrifaction."<ref target="#CH8-n79"
                     >79</ref> Whether the commercial holiday was caused by problems with copper <pb n="231"/> coinage or the intensity of the heat, or a
                  combination, the result was that the poor and those merchants holding a large number of the "fluctuating medium" bore the brunt of the
                  devaluation. Again it is emphasized that the coppers lost their acceptability during a postwar depression with a continued specie shortage.
                  Although the price for bills of exchange remained stable during this same time,<ref target="#CH8-n80">80</ref> there was an unexplained ripple
                  effect which resulted in a 20% reduction in the value of certain fractional silver coins. <q>It has been remarked that since the outcry was
                     raised about Copper Coin, the Silver has depreciated in value, and, what is entirely unaccountable upon any just principles is quarters,

               <p>It is of interest to recall the contemporary descriptions of the circulating coppers in which the public had lost confidence. Previous mention

                  country for twenty or thirty years past" had been counterfeit English halfpence and that more recently "a large number of counterfeit Copper
                  Coin manufactured in this and the Neighboring States, [had] ... been in circulation in this Commonwealth."<ref target="#CH8-n83">83</ref> In
                  March 1787, the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> legislative committee listed the principal coppers currently in circulation as "a few"
                  regal halfpence of <name type="pname">George II</name> and earlier monarchs, "a number" of Irish halfpence, "a very great number" of
                  counterfeit English halfpence presumably of <name type="pname">George III</name>, as well as "a very considerable number" of legal and
                  counterfeit <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers.<ref target="#CH8-n84">84</ref> Another writer described the following coppers which
                  he had encountered in circulation: 1727 French copper at 182 grains, 1698 French liard at 54 grains, 1773 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>
                  halfpenny at 120 grains, 1783 <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> at 145 grains, 1764 quarter stuber at 38 grains, and a smoothly worn
                  English halfpenny at 156 grains.<ref target="#CH8-n85">85</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Another assertion appeared which stated that 95% of the coppers in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> were counterfeit <q>...about 19 parts in
                     20 of the copper coin now in circulation in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> are counterfeit‚Äîsome of them are made of copper tolerably
                     fine, but about one third part of their proper weight deficient: others are about the proper weight, but so adulterated with a baser
                     mixture as to be more than one third deficient in value: and others deficient both in weight and fineness.<ref target="#CH8-n86">86</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>While the contention that 95% of the coppers were false was challenged by another writer as an exaggeration, it was agreed that the coins were
                     lightweight.<ref target="#CH8-n87">87</ref> The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> Common Council itself drew attention to the
                  circulating copper medium and remarked that it is was so variable both in weight and fineness that it was impossible for them to offer an
                  opinion about its <pb n="232"/> real value, hence that board would not commit itself to a recommended exchange rate as had their <name
                     type="place">New York</name> counterparts.<ref target="#CH8-n88">88</ref> The decision regarding exchange rate was left to the discretion
                  of the individual, but the Council did observe "that the copper contained in a pound weight avoirdupois of the best of them is not equal in
                  value to one shilling <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money, and that the far greater part of them are mixed with base metal, of which
                  it will require from sixty to eighty to weigh a pound." One editorialist actually experimented with weighing twelve coppers "of [the] kind
                  generally in circulation among us" and calculated the average at 116.6 grains. He further observed that, "For these coppers, the coppersmiths
                  in this city will pay 9d. per lb. weight."<ref target="#CH8-n89">89</ref> Although there was no further description of the actual copper coins
                  weighed, their deficiency is obvious.</p>
               <p>Despite this well publicized excess of inferior coppers, a news report from July 31, 1789, exposed the scheme of an unnamed <name type="place"
                     >Philadelphian</name>, who, already an importer of counterfeits, was preparing to open a mint for the manufacture of spurious copper coins
                  in order to increase his profits.<ref target="#CH8-n90">90</ref> Other domestic counterfeiting operations were smashed during that summer and
                  the public was warned through the press to beware of false 1781 and 1789 Spanish American milled dollars, 1770 French crowns, and doubloons
                  which contained 16 to 20% alloy.<ref target="#CH8-n91">91</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The answer to the generic problem of an unstable copper medium and the current panic can be traced back to the comments of <name type="pname"
                     >Sir Isaac Newton</name> in 1713, when he was the Master of the Tower Mint (1699-1727). He advocated that the token value of copper coins
                  should never exceed the actual cost of the metal plus the expense of manufacturing. No profit should be allowed. He urged that the supply of
                  token coinage be limited to the needs of the economy and an excess supply be avoided.<ref target="#CH8-n92">92</ref> All these tenets had been
                  violated in both <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> where the Crown and minting patentees derived a
                  profit. The potential gain encouraged illegal operators to engage in wholesale counterfeiting until soon false halfpence outnumbered the
                  genuine and these false coins clogged commerce on both sides of the Atlantic. Not only were the legal coppers greatly outnumbered by the
                  false, lightweight ones, but it was also recognized that "the quantity of this coin in circulation throughout <name type="place"
                     >America</name> is ten times greater than necessary for change."<ref target="#CH8-n93">93</ref> As could be predicted from <name
                     type="pname">Newton</name>'s admonitions regarding copper coinage, it was only a matter of time before public confidence in a surplus of
                  mostly counterfeit token coinage would fail and the house of cards collapse.</p>
               <p>Much editorial speculation regarding the cause of this coppers panic appeared, particularly in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>
                  papers. It was suggested that there should have been governmental intervention and it was "acknowledged that the power of regulating the value
                  of coin or money is in the Congress, but this is a desperate case that requires immediate relief; and therefore something should be done until
                  that body took it up."<ref target="#CH8-n94">94</ref> Realizing that local governments were impotent to provide a final solution for copper
                  devaluation, most municipal authorities anticipated that with the promised appearance of the new Fugio coins from Congress, the copper problem
                  would be solved, but alas, that expectation was only wishful thinking. <q>When this emission appears all foreign copper coin may be thrown out
                     of circulation, and if Congress limit the quantity they issue within reasonable bounds, the evil will be wholly done away.<ref

               <pb n="233"/>
               <p>One writer observed that the lack of small bills of paper money below five shillings was another factor responsible for the troubles with the
                  copper medium.<ref target="#CH8-n96">96</ref> He postulated that in the absence of a paper money alternative for small change, the public
                  became dependent on copper which was then introduced in massive quantities until its confidence was abused. If small paper notes redeemable in
                  specie had been available, then less reliance on copper would have developed, discouraging manufacturers, speculators, and importers of
                  counterfeits.</p>
               <p>In a letter to the editor of <hi rend="italic">The Independent Gazette</hi>, one reader made an astute commentary further defining the cause
                  of the copper problem and proposing a solution: <q>The present confusion at <name type="place">New-York</name> and <name type="place"
                        >Philadelphia</name> about the coppers ... has altogether arisen from the currency given to base falsifications of the British
                     half-pence. Had these counterfeits, easily discoverable ... been steadily refused at the time, (above a year ago) when the regulation of 24
                        [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] coppers for a shilling took place, all had been well. But the alteration just mentioned, instead of
                     relieving us, has only given new opening for speculation; then foretold, and since eagerly laid hold of. The true British copper coin,
                     lowered under its value in <name type="place">England</name>, has ever since been collecting and sending to <name type="place"
                        >London</name>, as a profitable remittance; whilst the makers of the base imitation have still found their advantage in sending over
                     their manufactures, which the Americans, though these raps for the most part have not even the colour of copper, are weak enough to
                     receive. The direct remedy to the disorder is obvious and easy; restore the genuine British half-pence, such as bears the effigies and
                     inscriptions, plainly and legibly, to the rate of 15 or 16 to the shilling, here and at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>; and inflexibly
                     reject all raps, counterfeits, and worn coppers. This is the only, but the sure guard against a deluge of false copper coin in <name
                        type="place">Europe</name>. Thus the coppers which remain in circulation, would be nearly worth the price at which they pass, we shall
                     be relieved of the counterfeits already here, and wholly prevent further importations of them. It is strange that the fathers of <hi

               </p>
               <p>The quoted "regulation of 24 coppers for a shilling" appears inconsistent with the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> rate of 20 coppers per
                  shilling even when considering that the author was from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> where the Spanish milled dollar was less
                  inflated in value. Although the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Legislature was able to establish exchange rates in 1787, the new
                  Constitution came into effect March 4, 1789, granting this right only to Congress which took no positive role in alleviating the crisis. The
                  writer of this letter observed that with the devaluation of the halfpence in 1787, it then became profitable to gather up all genuine and
                  unworn halfpence in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> at a reduced cost and return them to <name type="place">England</name> where they could
                  be negotiated at full value of 24 to the shilling, thus gaining 48% in the transaction.<ref target="#CH8-n98">98</ref> The flux of coppers
                  into <name type="place">England</name>, where they were more highly valued, was a reenactment of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>
                  situation of 1735 and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> 15 years later where coppers were attracted due to more favorable exchange rates. It,
                  therefore, comes as no surprise that genuine <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence, which were not even a common coin in <name
                     type="place">New York</name> in 1787, have not been reported in colonial American excavations or hoards since most which arrived here were
                  likely returned to <name type="place">England</name> by speculators, perhaps the same people who imported the counterfeits. The reference that
                  "these raps ... are weak enough to receive" appears to suggest that they could still be purchased abroad in bulk at attractive discounts so as
                  to return a profit to the investor. Thus the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Act of April 20, 1787, designed to regulate <pb n="234"/> and
                  improve the circulation of coppers actually encouraged the exportation of acceptable regal halfpence and increased the ratio of "<name
                     type="place">Birminghams</name>" to genuine coppers in circulation, up to 95% according to one account.</p>
               <p>It had been anticipated that the Fugio coinage would terminate this problem, when actually the Congressional issue was due for its own
                  disaster which will be recalled below. Following ratification of the new Constitution, only the national government was enpowered to regulate
                  currency and the lack of Federal intervention was criticized. It was suggested that if the public were faced with "a large influx of ... base
                  coins of gold and silver" that it would be a "dreadful situation ... without ... an immediate interposition by some authority."<ref
                     target="#CH8-n99">99</ref> But since copper was not a coin of intrinsic value as were gold and silver, it was "little regarded; hence in
                  the last, the public are liable to great impositions."<ref target="#CH8-n100">100</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Numerous solutions were proposed in the press to end the Coppers Panic. One approach suggested that market forces would determine in the long
                  run how many coppers the public would accept for a shilling.<ref target="#CH8-n101">101</ref> A more immediate answer was for the <name
                     type="place">Philadelphia</name> Common Council to recommend a rate of 48 to the shilling as had happened in <name type="place">New
                     York</name>.<ref target="#CH8-n102">102</ref> These rates would not be equivalent due to the inequality in the monies of account between
                  the two cities, 48 coppers in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> being on par with 45 in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>, and 48 in the
                  latter equal to 51 in the former. It was emphasized that such suggestions were but recommendations since only Congress could now regulate the
                  currency. In addition to the devaluation, it was urged that all counterfeits be rejected, commenting that a child of three could soon learn to
                  tell the difference between genuine and false coppers. A more radical proposal from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> advanced the
                  recommendation of 96 coppers to the shilling,<ref target="#CH8-n103">103</ref> and one <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> distiller advertised
                  that he would accept 60 to the shilling or 10d. per pound.<ref target="#CH8-n104">104</ref> A <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> merchant,
                     <name type="pname">Amos Wickersham</name>, publicized that he had "use for a quantity of Coppers now in circulation, [and] will sell,

                     ran for one week at the height of the "Coppers Panic," attested to the significant depreciation of coppers while attempting to maintain a

               <p>One published treatise on copper urged that copper never should acquire legal tender status nor should a creditor be obliged to receive even
                  partial payment of a debt in copper.<ref target="#CH8-n106">106</ref> The logic advanced for this pronouncement included the financial loss
                  which would be incurred since copper passed at a rate greater than its intrinsic value. It was also argued that due to the weight and bulk of
                  a large payment of copper, there would be significant transportation and storage problems. For example, if one were required to accept only 5%
                  of a $10,000 debt in copper, the payment would weigh 1,180 pounds. The writer also emphasized the relatively greater expense to mint copper
                  coins as compared to gold and silver, and that the final result would be a greater quantity of copper in circulation than would be necessary
                  for small change. A compromise proposal would be a billon coinage of half copper and silver so that the coin would be physically large enough
                  and yet have intrinsic value so that creditors would not suffer. Congress eventually heeded the ideas advanced in the treatise since copper
                  coinage from the Federal mint did not become legal tender until 1864, and in fact, half cents were rejected as currency by the public in
                     1811.<ref target="#CH8-n107">107</ref> The billon coinage, as well as a later idea to insert a silver plug in copper coins to augment
                  intrinsic value never came to fruition.<ref target="#CH8-n108">108</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Some less serious ideas were tendered to cope with the surplus of coppers including their consumption in the manufacture of sleigh bells which

                  The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> Common Council interrupted their solemn discussion of the copper problem when some members proposed
                  that the excess coppers could be exchanged for tea or used in the manufacture of frying pan bottoms, and copper buttons: <q>
                     <name type="pname">Mr. E.</name> ... then proposed, that the coppers be immediately sent to Botany Bay, and exchanged for the best Hyson

                  <q>
                     <name type="pname">Mr. L.</name> said, the proposal was a good one, ... whenever the first ship-load is gone, they [coppers] will

                  <q>
                     <name type="pname">Mr. S.</name>, an able statesman and renowned politician ... moved that it be recommended to the good people of the

                     48,000,000, a number far exceeding the coppers in circulation; the importation of frying pan bottoms from <name type="place">Britain</name>
                     would then cease, our manufacturers would be encouraged, our wisdom and economy would astonish the world.<ref target="#CH8-n110">110</ref>

               <p>It is probable that those whom the devaluation of copper affected the most, namely the poor and the smaller merchants, did not see much levity
                  in the situation or appreciate the jokes poked at their misfortune. Such is the tone of a letter written to the editor of <hi rend="italic"
                     >The Federal Gazette</hi>. <q>
                     <name type="pname">Mr. Brown</name>.</q>
                  <q>It is really laughable to hear the different opinions offered about the copper coin. But to be serious, I would advise the Corporation of
                     the large trading cities to endeavor to come to some agreement about the rate at which coppers shall be received in payments as change, at
                     least such of them as appear to be good copper.<ref target="#CH8-n116">116</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This was essentially the course that many cities adopted. The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Common Council recommended a rate of 48
                  coppers to the shilling on July 21, 1789, an action also taken by <name type="place">Albany</name> four days later where the following
                  scenario was described: <q>The immense quantities of light coppers made of base metal, which have been teaming in upon us for near a
                     twelve-month at different parts of the state, particularly <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> [City], have at length occasioned a
                     depreciation of near 3/4ths of their value. Many of the merchants and shop keepers of this city [<name type="place">Albany</name>], must
                     sustain considerable losses, by so sudden a depreciation, nor are they the only sufferers on this occasion, every class of citizen will
                     experience it, in a greater or lesser degree, particularly the bakers and <pb n="238"/> butchers; there is an instance of one of the former
                     receiving, in the course of one day last week, in trifling sums, upward of six pounds.<ref target="#CH8-n117">117</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> refused to endorse a position but deferred to an exchange rate for coppers set by market forces since
                  they recognized they had no right to act under the new Constitution. By September 5, 1789, the exchange rate for <name type="place">New
                     Jersey</name> coppers in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> had improved to 24 per shilling, which were the only coppers authorized to
                  circulate in the state. This fact was noted in the press by the following news item with an admonishment: "Coppers with the <name type="place"
                     >Jersey</name> stamp, are now current at two for a penny: It is hoped, that the mint masters [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] will be so
                  moderate as not to glut the market."<ref target="#CH8-n118">118</ref>
                  <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers were preferentially received since they enjoyed a legal tender status in their home state for the
                  payment of taxes.<ref target="#CH8-n119">119</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Not only were the municipalities struggling under this deluge of unwanted copper coin, but also the state governments of <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">New Jersey</name> were perplexed as to how to empty their respective treasuries of this rejected
                  money. The constitutional prohibition against state coinages notwithstanding, the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> Assembly directed the
                  state treasurer in December 1790, to sell or dispose of the coppers remaining in the treasury in exchange for liquidated notes or state
                  securities, provided that that "he can obtain two shillings in said Notes or Securities pr [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] pound weight for said
                  Coppers." This would imply an official "suggested" exchange rate for this fiscal paper of 24.3 coppers per shilling for regulation weight
                  coins of 144 grains. It is to be recalled that <name type="place">Connecticut</name> never published an exchange rate for coppers in that
                  jurisdiction. Apparently the move did not rid the state coffers of coppers since a May 1791 instruction to the state treasurer authorized him
                  "to dispose of the Coppers now in the Treasury and the property of this State to the best advantage ...."<ref target="#CH8-n120">120</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> apparently had no problem with its coppers and did not alter the exchange rate of the residual cents
                  and half cents remaining in the treasury as evidenced by a resolution passed on June 10, 1790. The document instructed the state treasurer to
                  pay out copper cents for debts of the Commomwealth at the rate of 108 for six shillings, lawful money, and to receive such coppers into the
                  treasury at the same rate, "any law or resolve to the contrary notwithstanding."<ref target="#CH8-n121">121</ref> It certainly appears that
                     <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> coppers maintained their regulated value throughout this period.</p>
               <p>An interesting comment made by <name type="pname">Jeremy Belknap</name> in relation to English coppers circulating in <name type="place">New
                     Hampshire</name> is worthy of examination.<ref target="#CH8-n122">122</ref> The historian described various scenes of patriotism at the
                  time of the Revolution where citizens of the state profaned in one way or another all images of the monarchy "and the half-pence, which bore
                  the name of <name type="pname">George III</name>, were either refused in payment, or degraded to farthings." To conclude the passage written
                  in 1791, <name type="pname">Belknap</name> added, "These last have not yet recovered their value." The implication of this statement is that
                  English coppers in <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> were depreciated in 1776 for an entirely different reason and never regained their
                  former value. It is unlikely that this continued depression in that state in the value of English coppers, most of which were likely
                  counterfeit, had anything to do with the Coppers Panic.</p>
               <p>The legal tender status of legitimate <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers was threatened by the presence of the overstruck <name
                     type="place">Elizabethtown</name> issues and "camel heads" previously described in detail, which it is believed, came on the scene after
                  the summer of 1789. These lightweight coppers became <pb n="239"/> such a concern to the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> General Assembly
                  that they were later the subject of a committee report submitted on June 7, 1790: <q>That the depreciation of the Copper Coin appears to be
                     entirely owing to the fraudulent practices of persons who have stamped <name type="place">Bermingham</name> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]
                     and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> Coppers with the same impression as those of this state, and afterwards passed them to others :
                     That the <name type="place">New-Jersey</name> Coppers coined by law, are superior in weight to the British,<ref target="#CH8-n123"
                        >123</ref> are of pure metal, and weigh six pennyweight six grains each, and that most of the counterfeits are of bass [<hi
                        rend="italic">sic</hi>] metal, and weigh less than five pennyweight each : That the <name type="place">New-Jersey</name> Coppers lately
                     passed at fifteen for a shilling, the rate directed by law, and the <name type="place">Bermingham</name> and <name type="place"
                        >Connecticut</name> Coppers could at the same time be procured for forty-five for a shilling, and that some persons have availed
                     themselves of the difference, and have changed the impression of a considerable quantity of bass [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Coppers,
                     converting one shilling's worth of those Coppers into three shillings worth of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> Coppers, which practice
                     has occasioned so great a dapreciation [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of the Coppers in this state, that in some places they do not
                     circulate, and in other places they pass at an unequal and uncertain value, from forty-eight to thirty-six for a shilling, though they
                     lately circulated at their full value, even in the neighbouring states [i.e. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, ed.] where no other
                     Coppers would pass.<ref target="#CH8-n124">124</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The committee further urged that the counterfeiters be discovered and prosecuted, although a suitable punishment could not be agreed upon.
                  Since the overstruck coins were so numerous, it would be "extremely difficult and troublesome, and indeed almost impracticable to distinguish
                  the real <name type="place">Jersey</name> Coppers from the counterfeits." The state treasurer was in a quandary to decide at which rate to
                  receive this potpourri of coppers in payment of taxes. If negotitated at 15 to the shilling, the state revenue would suffer financial loss
                  from taking in the counterfeits, but if received at a depreciated rate of from 36 to 48 per shilling, an amount far below issue, then it would
                  be a breach of faith on the part of the state. The treasurer was spared having to solve this dilemma when the assembly directed him, by a June
                  10, 1790 resolution, to accept no more coppers into the state coffers. The predicament of assigning an equitable exchange rate to <name
                     type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers was effectively circumvented, or postponed, by the legislature when they refused to accept more
                  copper coin. The <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> legal tender status of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers was suspended since these
                  coins were no longer receivable in payment of obligations to the state. Still the Assembly had to reckon with the large supply of coppers
                  remaining in state custody and so in November 1792, directed that coppers in the treasury be paid out at the then customary rate of 24 to the
                     shilling.<ref target="#CH8-n125">125</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The action which seemed the most decisive in curtailing the Coppers Panic was taken by the Bank of <name type="place">North America</name> in
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> when on August 6, 1789, it issued paper tickets in denominations of $ 3/90, or 3d. specie, <name
                     type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money, and $ 1/90, or 1d. specie, <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> money. The rationale expressed in
                  support of this emission of paper money was "merely for the publick convenience at the juncture when the Circulation of Copper Coin is nearly
                  suspended ...."<ref target="#CH8-n126">126</ref> This initiative was well received as evidenced by a notice thanking the Bank for the

                  coppers and greatly needed this small denominational paper, since there were only eight known issuers from <name type="place">New

                  represented. Outside of the economic orbit of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, the only other small change notes were those authorized by

               <p>In this period, nine <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> congregations chose to issue paper notes instead of receiving devaluated coppers in

                     conceives to be improper, the same notes do not circulate throughout the state, and are therefore inconvenient to the holders; there is no
                     security that they will be paid on demand, and indeed there are instances of persons issuing notes, and afterwards becoming insolvent,
                     thereby defrauding the holders who are generally of the most ignorant class, and who ought therefore more particularly to be under the
                     protection of the Legislature‚ÄîFurther, the notes increase the circulating paper medium, banish the small silver coins, and are a

               <p>There is a subplot in the story of the Coppers Panic of 1789 involving the Fugio cents which had been authorized by Congress on April 21,
                  1787. The new coppers, passing at 100 to the Spanish milled dollar, conformed to the 157.5 grain standard recommended in the April 8, 1786
                  Report of the Board of Treasury to the Continental Congress, and passed by resolution four months later.<ref target="#CH8-n133">133</ref> The
                  attempt to replace the hodgepodge of circulating coppers by a Federal coinage was also sanctioned by the Ordinance of October 16, 1786, which
                  confirmed that only these coppers, and none others, would be legal tender for <name type="place">United States</name> taxes, that only coppers
                  of the 157.5 grains standard could circulate, and that after September 1, 1787, no foreign coppers would be current in the Confederation.<ref
                     target="#CH8-n134">134</ref> The decree seems to have been so much rhetoric and achieved little respect since only the <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> mint adopted the required standard, and there continued a plethora of foreign coppers. Moreover, in <name
                     type="place">New York</name>, the new exchange rate of 20 coppers to the local shilling, effective August 1, 1787, would have reduced the
                  Fugio cents from the Federal standard of 100 per dollar to value of only 70¬¢ for coins circulating in that jurisdiction.<ref
                     target="#CH8-n135">135</ref> The unanswered question remains, if the Fugio coppers still retained the legal tender status intended by the
                  Ordinance of October 16, 1786, why were the Federal standard and Fugio cents ignored in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>? <name type="pname"
                     >Douglas</name> suggested that "the subsequent decision not to establish a mint and to instead secure coppers by private contract evidently
                  nullified this [legal tender] provision."<ref target="#CH8-n136">136</ref> This must have been the situation since early documents are silent
                  on the subject of legal tender status and redemption for the Fugio coppers.<ref target="#CH8-n137">137</ref> Because of the unfavorable
                  economic climate, the newly minted Fugios which were delivered to the Treasury by <name type="pname">James Jarvis</name> in May 1788, were
                  held out of circulation. <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, the only area where the Fugios and the indigenous state coppers would have
                  been at par on the same standard, would have been a logical place to have released the new Federal coins. An August 1, 1789 report from <name
                     type="place">Boston</name> suggests that this action may have been considered but the option was never pursued.<ref target="#CH8-n138"
                     >138</ref> Instead the Fugio cents were sold in bulk in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> to a speculator, Royal Flint, in June 1789. If
                  the Fugio cents had the legal tender status as originally proposed, it is inconceivable that the government would have dumped them in such a
                  manner. Had they been receivable for taxes, this money would have enjoyed the same preference as the <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                  coppers. Unfortunately for Flint, he could not dispose of his new purchases by the time the Coppers Panic struck later that summer. At the
                  rate of 48 coppers per shilling recommended by the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Common Council, the owner of 100 Fugios could expect to
                  receive 29¬¢!</p>
               <p>There was a strategy developed in May 1788, to increase the Federal standard to 210 grains, whereby the Fugio cent would have circulated as a
                  three-quarters cent.<ref target="#CH8-n139">139</ref> Nothing ever came of this proposal which would have brought the token value of the
                  Fugios more into line with their intrinsic value and discouraged the currency of counterfeits. This positive action could have bolstered
                  public confidence in coppers to the extent that the subsequent collapse might have been moderated or even averted. Congress, both under the
                  Confederation and new Constitution, ignored the problem of an inadequate copper medium for many months and took no action despite indications
                  of a developing crisis. Although the Federal government was occupied with more important issues, an interest on its part might have prevented
                  the calamity which injured those dependent on small change, an opinion supported by many editorialists of the era.</p>
               <pb n="245"/>
               <p>The previously mentioned token, the Mott storecard, dated 1789, and issued by a <name type="place">New York City</name> firm, has been
                  attributed to this period or possibly antedated from the late 1830s. The coin arouses particular interest at this juncture since it comes in
                  two distinct weights, a light one slightly over 100 grains and a heavier one from 164 to 233 grains. The heavier planchet is compatible with
                  the proposed increase in the Federal standard to 210 grains which never survived the legislative process. If the token is actually of 1789
                  vintage, it can be speculated that the heavier coin was a purposeful attempt to provide a token of more acceptable intrinsic value and thereby
                  assure popular approval at a time when the circulation of coppers was at a low ebb.</p>

                  <name type="pname">Davis</name>'s diary confirms that the Coppers Panic which hit <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> hard in July began to
                  slacken by early September and provides further evidence that after September 5, 1789, only <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers were

                  intrinsic value.<ref target="#CH8-n143">143</ref> There must have been a complete lack of public faith in coppers to have sustained this
                  ludicrous devaluation of superior quality coppers. The traveler does not comment on the exchange rate in <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> but implies a rate of 48 to the shilling in <name type="place">Rhode Island</name>. No contemporaneous evidence can

                  Panic. On the contrary, there was an action of the General Court in June 1790, already cited, which instructed the state treasury to continue
                  to receive and disburse cents at the legally established rate of 108 for six shillings, lawful money, or 18 to the <name type="place"
                     >Massachusetts</name> shilling.</p>
               <p>Another account of the events of the day is contained in a letter written from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> on August 1, 1789.<ref

                  change medium, a notion which is confirmed by the legislature's June 1790 resolution to accept and disperse cents at their established rate.
                  Thus the collapse did not spread into the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> area, although there could have been some minor, local, fluctuation
                  in the exchange rate for coppers which remained at 18 to the <name type="place">New England</name> shilling.<ref target="#CH8-n150">150</ref>
                  Any significant devaluation in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> would certainly have attracted the attention of the local press,
                  diarist <name type="pname">Davis</name>, or <name type="pname">Felt</name>. <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> did have an increase in the
                  exchange rate, as noted by <name type="pname">Davis</name>, which did not approach the degree seen in <name type="place">Connecticut</name>.
                  The conclusion that <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents and half cents stabilized the copper medium locally is not unreasonable
                  since in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, in September 1789, when only <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers were accepted, the
                  exchange rate rapidly fell from 48 to 24 <pb n="247"/> and thus sustained the rate. The apparent reason is that the public had regained
                  partial confidence in <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coinage which had a legal tender basis and was more consistent in quality than the
                  alternative counterfeits. Finally, after repeated urgings, the citizens of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> gathered sufficient courage and
                  insight to reject all coppers, other than the <name type="place">New Jerseys</name>, having been so recently injured by the lightweight <name
                     type="place">Birminghams</name>. <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> throughout this period always had a reliable copper coinage of its
                  own to depend upon and for that reason it can be postulated that no widespread devaluation occurred.</p>
               <p>One outcome from the Coppers Panic of 1789 was sure; all previous governmental attempts to regulate the circulation of coppers failed and now
                  the public looked to the Federal government for a permanent solution to the problem of an unstable copper medium under the authority of the
                  new Constitution. The Coppers Panic should have come as no surprise to anyone since it had been brewing for years. Minor riots occurred in
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> in 1741 and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> in 1753, but these isolated events triggered no
                  definitive correction. While all classes could be hurt with the devaluation of copper currency, it appears that most, if not all, the
                  agitation for a revaluation of the small change medium originated with the merchants. All the enabling legislation which had established the
                  state mints spoke of the base coppers in circulation and the need for a better copper coinage. However, when such a proposal came to the <name
                     type="place">New York</name> Legislature to mint state coppers, it was rejected in favor of an action to devalue the existing medium. A
                  legislative committee report was issued alleging the enormous profits made from minting copper token coinage, and their Congressional
                  delegation lobbied for an increase in the Federal standard. The bubble finally broke in the summer of 1789, when the circulation of coppers
                  from <name type="place">Connecticut</name> to <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> virtually ceased.<ref target="#CH8-n151">151</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In Chapter One it was observed that the economic climate in <name type="place">British North America</name>, no matter how local in scope it
                  may have appeared from time to time, was in large measure a domestic manifestation of the more global situation. Whereas the Coppers Panic has
                  been interpreted thus far in the regional context of an excessive, inflated, unsound copper medium whose token value would no longer be
                  honored in commerce, this is a major oversimplification. In fact, the Coppers Panic was only a local symptom of an international condition,
                  namely a major post-war depression during which many commodity prices, including copper, fell on the worldwide market. There is a parallel
                  which can be drawn here with the collapse of the tin medium in <name type="place">Great Britain</name> some 90 years earlier. The major
                  difference between the Coppers Panic in 1789 and the late 1690s when the price of tin could not be maintained as it lost its commodity value
                  on the world market, is that the patentees of the tin coinages were obliged to redeem their failing currency with copper coins. Hence, the
                  unwanted tin money did not glut the marketplace but was removed and replaced by a more desirable copper currency. Any loss then was not borne
                  by the public but rather by the tin speculators.</p>
               <p>The condition of the world copper market was of particular importance to <name type="place">North America</name> since the domestic copper
                  industry here remained insignificant until the Lake Superior ore deposits were opened in 1844. Although copper was discovered in <name

               <p>Since the economies of all major American cities moved independently of each other and of the large European centers, recovery from the
                  post-Revolutionary War depression was asynchronous. Prices in <name type="place">Amsterdam</name>, a major international commercial center,
                  had already started to climb by the spring of 1786 while <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> was still in the grips of a severe depression.<ref

                     >Charleston</name>, <name type="place">South Carolina</name>, the nadir of price decline occurred in April 1789, when an advance began

               <p>The recovery of world copper prices after 1790, was accompanied by a restoration of faith in the domestic copper medium. "The rise in the
                  price of copper metal helped restore mercantile confidence in copper coins and their acceptance was reestablished in some parts of the Middle
                  Atlantic and northeastern states."<ref target="#CH8-n167">167</ref> As the world commodity price for copper climbed during <pb n="250"/> the
                  French Revolution, the Federal standard for copper coins from the Federal Mint required readjustment and was lowered to 208 grains for the
                  cent on April 2, 1792. The world copper prices were watched carefully in this country as witnessed by a letter from <name type="pname"
                     >Alexander Bilsland</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> to the Mint Director, <name type="pname">Elias Boudinot</name>,
                     <q>Sir: I have examined with attention the different prices of copper in the English Market for the last 1 years. In 1791 it was 10d pr lb.
                     at which rate it had continued for a number of years. A Letter from the Manufacturer dated 3rd Dec '91 informs me that it had risen to 11d.
                     In the summer of '92 it advanced to 12d. On the 10th October '92 it rose to 12 1/2 d at which price it continued till the 23rd Feb '93 when
                     it rose to 14d. On the 4th Nov. of the Same Year it fell to 13 1/2 d and continued at that price until the 5th March '95 when it fell to
                     13d. at which price it still continues. The prices above stated are Money prices.</q>
                  <q>I will engage to supply any quantity of the best manufactured copper that comes from <name type="place">England</name> ...<ref

               </p>
               <p>A communication from the Mint Office by <name type="pname">Henry William De Saussure</name> to President <name type="place">Washington</name>
                  on October 27, 1795, stated in part, "the price of copper having risen considerably, from causes which, it is said, will be operative for some
                  length of time, if not permanently, it has been suggested that it would be useful to diminish the weight of the cent, as the copper would,
                  thereby, be brought nearer to its proportionate value to silver, and might prevent its being worked up by the coppersmiths."<ref
                     target="#CH8-n169">169</ref> Heeding this suggestion, <name type="place">Washington</name> subsequently reduced the copper cent to 168
                  grains on December 25, 1795. Had these downward adjustments in coin weight not occurred, then the market value of the copper in the Federal
                  coinages would have soon exceeded their monetary value with the predictable consequence that the new <name type="place">United States</name>
                  cents and half cents would have rapidly disappeared into the melting pot and ended up as copper implements of one sort or another.<ref
                     target="#CH8-n170">170</ref> "The wheel is come full circle."</p>
               <p>The question asked in the preface of this book can now be answered. Why did the state coinages endure only from 1785 to 1789? There are
                  several reasons. The most obvious political answer is that under the Constitution, states could no longer mint coins, print paper money, or
                  regulate currency. For years there had been an unwieldy expansion of copper currency, primarily because of the unrestricted volumes of
                  lightweight counterfeit halfpence imported from <name type="place">England</name>. State legislatures failed in their attempt to stabilize the
                  copper medium since, in a large part, they only encouraged expansion of an already unwieldy currency pool which was greatly in excess of
                  commercial requirements. The public did not actively discriminate which coins they would accept as copper currency as long as they received
                  the prescribed value for their money. The abundant coppers accumulated in unspendable quantities, since they were receivable only in small,
                  domestic transactions. When the merchants began to accept coppers only at reduced rates, their circulation could no longer be supported in the
                  metropolitan areas of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> and the bottom dropped out of the market.
                  Then all coppers were viewed with suspicion, even "old <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, with his bow and arrow," as the entire medium
                  collapsed. <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers with legal tender status made an early recovery. The surplus of unwanted coppers did
                  not even command a favorable price as a commodity since this Coppers <pb n="251"/> Panic coincided with, or was spurred on by, a slump in
                  copper prices on international exchanges; as worldwide copper prices recovered and the public became more discriminate as to what money they
                  would accept, good quality coppers regained their usefulness as a small change medium.</p>
               <p>From a purely numismatic viewpoint, it is both remarkable and surprising that such little attention has been paid to the most prevalent copper
                  coin circulating in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> during Colonial and Confederation times, namely the counterfeit English halfpence. Both
                  the domestic counterfeit halfpence from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> and the imported <name type="place">Birminghams</name> are
                  very important coins in our numismatic legacy and deserve equal consideration. Other coppers which deserve numismatic recognition as having
                  circulated in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> as a part of the small change medium include the genuine English halfpence and farthings,
                  especially those dated 1749, and the regal and counterfeit Irish halfpence.</p>
               <p>The Coppers Panic of 1789 was a multifactoral phenomenon. The determinants of the panic essentially involve a recapitulation of the prior
                  history of North American currency as detailed in earlier chapters. To understand the factors leading up to this exigency when the copper
                  medium collapsed during that scorching summer of 1789, requires an appreciation of our numismatic heritage from those earlier periods. The
                  salient points can be briefly summarized:</p>
               <list>
                  <item rend="hang">1. <name type="place">British North America</name>, lacked a uniform currency and relied on foreign silver and gold and
                     English coppers.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">2. Over the years there developed an absolute surplus of coppers, far more than commerce required. Since coppers could only
                     be used as change and for small transactions, merchants encountered problems in disposing of excess numbers of coppers which would
                     accumulate.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">3. The majority of these coppers were counterfeit, as in <name type="place">England</name>.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">4. The coppers probably concentrated in seaport cities where they were imported by profiteers. "The real injury lay in the
                     unrestricted volume, which was aggravated by the concentration in certain cities."<ref target="#CH8-n171">171</ref>
                  </item>
                  <item rend="hang">5. State authorities considered that such cheap coppers defrauded the public.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">6. States endeavored to mint true value coppers to correct this perception of a fraudulent copper medium.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">7. State coppers failed in their task to provide a stable, just, copper medium. Due to counterfeits and lightweight
                     overstrikes, many state issues became just as inferior as those they were intended to replace.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">8. Good English coppers were exported back to <name type="place">England</name> at a profit as the exchange rate here became
                     favorable to do so.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">9. All coppers were treated as equal and passed "without discrimination." For years the public did not care about the
                     quality of their coppers as long as they received the established exchange.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">10. Since only <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers had any legal tender provisions, there was greater advantage to
                     counterfeit them.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">11. Low denominational silver coins had always been in short supply, but now the postwar depression aggravated this
                     shortage. The scant supply of small silver was further drained, as predictable from <name type="pname">Gresham</name>'s law, since the
                     abundant, cheap, coppers would have encouraged hoarding of the more desirable currency. "The more valuable metals are daily giving place to
                     base British half-pence, and no means are used to prevent this fraud. This disease, which is neglected in the beginning, because it appears
                     trifling, may finally prove very destructive to commerce."<ref target="#CH8-n172">172</ref>
                  </item>
                  <item rend="hang">12. There was no small denominational paper.</item>
                  <pb n="252"/>
                  <item rend="hang">13. Because of a worldwide decline in the price of copper, copper tokens even lost their commodity value.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">14. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> was slower to recover from the postwar depression.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">15. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>'s money of account was the most inflated in terms of sterling.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">16. After two earlier skirmishes, the copper medium lost public confidence in July 1789. The situation was probably ignited
                     by merchants who were being harmed by the accumulation of more coppers than they could spend.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">17. The situation in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> was probably aggravated
                     by local newspaper accounts and mercantile interests.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">18. Due to Constitutional restraints, the state and local governments could not deal effectively with the crisis, and for
                     whatever reasons, the Federal Government would not tackle it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Faith in the copper medium returned and the circulation of coppers resumed as:</p>
               <list>
                  <item rend="hang">1. Small denominational paper was made available.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">2. People became more discriminating in what coins they would receive and recognized the superiority of <name type="place"
                        >New Jersey</name> coppers.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">3. The depression lifted and trade again flourished.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">4. Copper became more valuable as a commodity as a result of market forces stimulated in part by war in <name type="place"
                        >Europe</name> and its price advanced on international exchanges.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">5. Federal coppers of greater and consistent weight appeared.</item>

                  <p>The cost of a loaf of bread gives the modern reader some perspective as to the contemporaneous purchasing power of copper currency.
                     Newspapers of the period published the "Assize of Bread," which was the regulated price fixed on the price of a barrel of flour. Before the
                     Revolution in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, a 1 lb. loaf sold for an equivalent of 2.1 coppers (<hi rend="italic">N.Y. Jour.</hi>,
                     June 3, 1766, and June 27, 1776). The price in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> quoted in June 1789, just before the coppers panic,
                     was 3.33 coppers for a pound of white bread [1d. per 6 oz.] (<hi rend="italic">Penna. Merc.</hi>, June 20, 1789). When the value of coppers
                     plummeted and the rate advanced from 15 to 48 to the local shilling, the anticipated price would have increased to 10.66 coppers per pound,
                     provided the baker would still elect to receive copper money. In <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, which did not suffer the effects
                     of the coppers panic, the published price per 1 lb. loaf in September 1789, was 4 coppers [2d. per 11.75 oz.] <name type="place">(<hi

                  <p>From Tables 3 and 5 it is recalled that the "old stamp" Spanish-American silver were the pillar dollars and their fractional parts at .9166
                     fine. The newer portrait silver dollars, after 1772, were .9038 fine. Except for worn or clipped coins, there is no legitimate explanation
                     why an old quarter dollar, or two bit piece, at .9166 fine, worth 25¬¢, should have been depreciated to a pistareen, or two reales piece at
                     .8333 fine, which passed for 20¬¢. There is no reference that other specie depreciated at this time. This depreciation for specific
                     fractional coins suggests that either money speculators were at work using the excuse of the coppers panic, or the other simplistic
                     explanation is that "during panics, people panic."</p>

                     however, without firsthand knowledge, it is unlikely that its author could have distinguished between locally manufactured and imported

                  <p>The point at which the market value for copper would exceed its token monetary value is predictable. This is not unlike the calculations
                     made by <name type="pname">Sumner</name> concerning the Pine Tree coinages, or the situation on July 8, 1963, when silver reached the
                     "numismatic melting point" of $1.29 per Troy ounce when it became worth more as a commodity than money (<hi rend="italic">CW Almanac</hi>,
                     p. 204). On February 8, 1794, <name type="pname">David Rittenhouse</name>, Director of the Mint, communicated that the profit derived from
                     600 lbs. of copper struck into $202 of cents and half cents was only $18.50. If the price of this copper increased to $178.50, or to 29.75¬¢
                     per pound, this would then be the break-even point for minting cents at the 208 grains standard (<hi rend="italic">A.S.P.F.</hi>, vol. 1,
                     p. 273). See note 64.</p>

               <lb/> Toward a More Perfect Union</head>
            <p>As the end of the Confederation period approached, the new union still lacked uniform exchange rates between the states, the country depended on
               diverse foreign specie for currency, and both the state and Federal governments had the power to regulate and produce money. The country was just
               edging out of a disastrous postwar depression and lacked both direction and unanimity. This chapter examines how this challenge was
               addressed.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to respond to some of these outstanding problems of the day, delegates from several states convened in <name type="place"
                  >Annapolis</name>, <name type="place">Maryland</name>, on September 11, 1786, to examine the trade regulations between their jurisdictions. It
               was all too evident that the Articles of Confederation were inadequate to cope with the current trade and economic crises and the need for their
               revision was obvious. "... Congress was doing little more than performing the function of a stately debating society."<ref target="#CH9-n1"
                  >1</ref> A second meeting was planned for May 1787, to propose amendments to the Articles of Confederation to make them "adequate to the
               exigencies of the government, and the preservation of the Union" and report back to Congress.<ref target="#CH9-n2">2</ref> The country was still
               in a deep depression, seven states had resorted to "rag money," a negative trade balance continued, hard money had all but disappeared, and
               experiments in copper coinage were destined for failure. Shays's Rebellion against taxation, which had occurred in western <name type="place"
                  >Massachusetts</name> through the summer of 1786 and into the early months of 1787, was fresh in everyone's memory, and more than any single
               event since the Revolution, drove home the need for a stronger national government.<ref target="#CH9-n3">3</ref> Although some historians suggest
               that too much emphasis has been placed on this "organized resistance to the collection of personal debts,"<ref target="#CH9-n4">4</ref> others
               suggest that Shays's Rebellion was one of the major events catalyzing the Constitutional Convention of 1787, in addition to calming the paper
               money craze all over the nation.<ref target="#CH9-n5">5</ref> Jensen postulated that Shays's Rebellion and its potential for civil unrest
               frightened <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</name> out of retirement and into politics.<ref target="#CH9-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The convention scheduled for May 1787, disregarded previous instructions. Rather than revise the existing Articles, it set to the task of framing
               an entirely new constitution. The new document significantly limited the powers of the individual states and vested additional authority within
               the Federal government. Congress was to become financially independent of the state legislatures since it was to be empowered to tax directly.
               Only the Federal government would have the power "to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights
               and measures."</p>
            <p>On September 17, 1787, the entirely new Constitution was finished and approved by the Convention.<ref target="#CH9-n7">7</ref> It now had to be
               ratified by the several state conventions. <name type="pname">Felt</name> writes of its <pb n="254"/> reception in <name type="place"
                  >Massachusetts</name>. "It is regarded by the friends of order and rational freedom, as essential to endow the National Administration with
               power sufficient to repair and regulate the system of the currency."<ref target="#CH9-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Support for the new constitution was far from unanimous. Proponents urged its acceptance in a collection of essays titled <hi rend="italic">The
                  Federalist</hi> written by such advocates as <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_66496514">Alexander Hamilton</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49254995">John Jay</name>, and <name
                  type="pname">James Madison</name>. These commentaries stressed the need for the Federal government to be the only jurisdiction with the
               authority to coin money and regulate its value. In regard to state mints, an author of <hi rend="italic">The Federalist</hi> continues, "... a
               right of coinage in the particular states could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify the forms and weights of the
               circulating pieces."<ref target="#CH9-n9">9</ref> This indeed had been the experience of the state mints under the Articles of Confederation. <hi
                  rend="italic">The Federalist</hi> concludes, "The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen ... and
               that all currencies must be managed at the Federal level."<ref target="#CH9-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The several state legislators who had supported paper money during 1785 and 1786 were the very ones who opposed the ratification of the new
               constitution when it was submitted to their respective assemblies.<ref target="#CH9-n11">11</ref> In <name type="place">Maryland</name>, voters
               were urged to send only those members to the ratifying convention who supported the new constitution since it was argued that those who favored
               paper money and the debtor bill "did not want an orderly government, but a chaotic one where they would be free to speculate."<ref
                  target="#CH9-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Less than ten months after the Constitution was reported out of the Convention, it was ratified by the ninth state, <name type="place">New
                  Hampshire</name>, on June 21, 1788 and became the new order of the land on March 4, 1789. It has been proposed <q>... that economic
                  deprivation was the major issue in the campaign for ratification of the Constitution. Because of the depression and its unwanted effects of a
                  collapsing economy, a shortage of money and burdensome debts and taxes, the people accepted the <name type="place">United States</name>
                  Constitution as a means that seemed to promise a way out of their troubles.<ref target="#CH9-n13">13</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In his book, <hi rend="italic">An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the <name type="place">United States</name>
               </hi>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_66503051">Charles A. Beard</name> developed the argument that the Constitution was written and directed by those leaders who were
               personally interested in, and derived economic advantages from this new system of government.<ref target="#CH9-n14">14</ref> He concluded that
               there were large and important economic interests and factors which were adversely affected by the government under the Articles of
               Confederation, including the largely still unpaid obligations of the Revolutionary War. Beard stressed class differences as determining factors
               in the evolution of the new Constitution but this theory has not withstood the scrutiny of modern day historians since "state and local studies
               have shown that in many areas political divisions did not reflect a pattern of conflict between rich and poor, creditor and debtor, merchant and
                  farmer."<ref target="#CH9-n15">15</ref> Specifically from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>, Beard's thesis is refuted where it has been
               shown that the leaders of the factions, both supporting and opposing the new Constitution, were all from the same socio-economic group of the
               landed aristocracy.<ref target="#CH9-n16">16</ref> But no matter what the motivation of the framers of the Constitution of 1787, this document
               has withstood the test of time.</p>

            <p>Even though the country had initiated a strong central government, it would take many years to sort out the monetary problems of the past 180
               years and before the currency would be in order. The major difference now was that prices and foreign exchange were quoted consistently in both
               Federal dollars and state currencies. Old habits die hard, and even today transactions on the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> Stock Exchange,
               established in 1792, are carried out in 1/8ths, a hold over from the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling, when eight traded for a Spanish
               milled dollar. Table 25, dated July 25, 1789, printed in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> Gazelle and Weekly Advertiser</hi>,<ref target="#CH9-n17">17</ref> was the contribution of one reader <pb
                  n="257"/> who wished to perform a public service. His desire was to reduce the "perplexity" of "the new money of account established by the
               late Congress" and familiarize "the good people of these <name type="place">United States</name>" with the new Federal decimal system as
               expressed "in the currency of the several States of the Union." Local monies of account did not disappear overnight but remained in use for at
               least another 40 years.<ref target="#CH9-n18">18</ref>

            <p>While it can be reasonably assumed that about every description of foreign money could have eventually found its way into North American
               commerce, some specific gold and silver issues were more commonly encountered. In conformity with the Federal decimal system, exchange rates for
               popular world specie coins of the period were established by the Act of July 31, 1789. These coins, many of which have not been previously
               mentioned during the colonial period, are listed in Table 26, where the value of gold to silver is maintained at a 16:1 ratio.</p>

            <p>The new regulation, which actually set the rate at which foreign coin would be received for the payment of duties, did not meet with universal
               approval. It was calculated by opponents that gold was overvalued by nearly 3% and silver was undervalued by more than 3% thereby giving gold a
               6% advantage.<ref target="#CH9-n19">19</ref> It was argued that because of this exchange differential, the public would pay revenues in
               overvalued gold, speculation would develop, and "a very lucrative trade will commence of bartering our silver for gold whereby our country will
               be immediately drained of silver." Others claimed that the French crown was overvalued by 1.5% and that importers could make a substantial
                  profit.<ref target="#CH9-n20">20</ref> According to Table 8, it appears that French silver was overvalued in terms of English crowns by 5.8%,
               and so this assertion was an underestimation. <pb n="258"/> Despite the apparent disagreement by some parties as to the wisdom of this new
               regulation, at least one editorialist was able to look on the light side of the situation with the following humorous ditty:</p>

            </lg>
            <p>In his first message to Congress, <name type="pname">President Washington</name> urged "uniformity in currency ..." It was not until April 2,
               1792, that legislation finally was passed which established a Federal mint.<ref target="#CH9-n22">22</ref> Under this new law, copper was still
               to remain a token coinage without legal tender status, while gold and silver were to be minted and circulated at a bimetallic standard ratio of
               fifteen to one. Foreign specie was to remain legal tender with Spanish silver retaining its position of eminence in the national currency until
               finally demonetized in 1857. The new Federal standard for copper was indeed increased to a significant 264 grains for cents and 132 grains for
               half cents, an action undoubtedly viewed with great favor by the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> legislature which had campaigned
               unsuccessfully for a change under the old Articles of Confederation.<ref target="#CH9-n23">23</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Copper prices rose abruptly after 1792, requiring a decrease in the standard weight for copper coins on January 26, 1793, even before any regular
               issues could be minted. A second reduction in standard, effective December 27, 1795, soon followed. It was anticipated that by the time $50,000
               in new cents and half cents had been placed in circulation by the Federal Mint, the small change supply would be sufficient so that all other
               coppers could be demonetized following an additional six months. With this end in mind, Congress, on May 8, 1792, stipulated that this foreign
               and miscellaneous copper demonetization would follow a proclamation to that effect when the output of the mint reached that target level.
               Although the Director of the Mint, <name type="pname">Elias Boudinot</name>, communicated to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_95296943">President Adams</name> on January
               1, 1800, that the mintage of copper was then $50,111.42, this proclamation was ignored and never promulgated and no definitive action against the
               bulk of sundry coppers occurred until 1857.<ref target="#CH9-n24">24</ref> A possible reason which may have prompted the President to disregard
               the demonetization of these other coppers was the fact that during its seven years of operation, the new Federal Mint had not supplied sufficient
               coppers for circulation needs. Responding to the expense of operating the mint, a Senate committee proposed that "perhaps a more economical, and
               the most effectual mode [to furnish and supply coppers] would be by contract."<ref target="#CH9-n25">25</ref> Boudinot opposed any option to
               import <name type="place">United States</name> coppers minted in <name type="place">England</name> under contract since it "would hazzard the
               running of a flood of cents, lighter than allowed by law, into the <name type="place">United States</name>, and the difficulty of preventing the
               evil would be great."<ref target="#CH9-n26">26</ref> In 1789 and 1790 a similar idea had been submitted by <name type="pname">John H.
                  Mitchell</name> of <name type="place">South Carolina</name>, who proposed that he could produce in <name type="place">England</name> pure
               copper coins at 14d. sterling per pound, ready for shipping. In a like manner, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> opposed the concept of having
               our coins minted in a foreign country.<ref target="#CH9-n27">27</ref> It was obvious that both Boudinot, the Mint Director, and <name
                  type="pname">Jefferson</name> were mindful of the lessons learned during the Confederation <pb n="259"/> period and were wary of the potential
               for abuses within the copper medium. They wished to maintain tight controls over the currency and ensure that history not repeat itself.</p>
            <p>By 1795, and probably earlier, the exchange rates for the Confederation coppers had returned to the values as reported in Table 11. At this time,
               however, the value of a "copper" was also expressed in terms of Federal currency at a value of 9.25 mills each, or 108 to the dollar.<ref
                  target="#CH9-n28">28</ref> State and Federal coppers continued to circulate together as confidence in the medium returned due in great part to
               the increased price of the metal. "The unauthorized copper pieces gradually disappeared without loss to the holders, since copper was much needed
               for industrial purposes."<ref target="#CH9-n29">29</ref> This was certainly a reversal from the situation of 1789 when coppers could not be given
               away.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Newman</name>, in his classic essay on the subject of early American coppers, has compiled many commentaries from various
               sources which attest to the fact that Confederation coppers, including state and <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> issues, <name
                  type="place">Virginia</name> halfpence, 1749 English halfpence, Fugio coppers, and other miscellaneous "<name type="place">Bungtown</name> and
               wretched coppers" "were still acceptable in trade in certain parts of the <name type="place">United States</name> in 1856."<ref target="#CH9-n30"
                  >30</ref> These pre-<name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint coppers circulated concurrently with Federal issues, their value and acceptance
               greatly determined by the current price of copper and prevailing economic conditions. The average citizen, however, was primarily interested in
               being able to spend them at the same rate they were received. But when the price of copper increased, the old copper coins would then be more
               valuable as scrap metal for industrial purposes than as money, and so would disappear from circulation into the melting pot. As conditions
               reversed, the old coppers would reappear as money, again illustrative of the interdependence of economics and numismatics. <name type="pname"
                  >Felt</name> reminisced on this subject of the small change medium in 1839, while still anticipating a Federal sanction against the coppers of
               his youth:<ref target="#CH9-n31">31</ref>
               <q>... thus the pennies, half-pennies, and farthings, dear to the early associations of many yet alive, and bearing the representation of
                  Britannia and their Majesties, as well as other coins of several states, are placed under the ban of legislative authority. Now and then the
                  remains of them have come forth and passed for a season, till driven back by new regulations ....</q>
            </p>
            <p>The copper coinage of the Confederation period had failed and the Federal mint, born of necessity to create a national coinage, was now a
               reality. "The halcyon days for coiners of copper were at an end and were never to return."<ref target="#CH9-n32">32</ref> The struggle for a
               uniform national currency which had started in the early days of colonialism was now in its last phase, but <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
               would not be independent of all foreign currency until all such money was finally demonetized. The Act of February 21, 1857, brought about the
               "termination of the long checkered history of the sanction of foreign coins as legal tender in this country."<ref target="#CH9-n33">33</ref> At
               long last the American Colonies, now the <name type="place">United States</name>, could finally boast their own coinage! A colorful, formative
               phase of numismatic history was now at an end, while another was just beginning.</p>

            <p>Because of unequal exchange rates between the standard Spanish American milled dollar and local currencies, it was necessary for Americans of the
               Colonial and Confederation periods to consult printed tables to determine the value of specific specie coins in the various monies of account.

            <p>A simple proportion formula can convert one currency into another. So, if one needs to change a sum of money, stated in one local money of
               account, into another currency, the following formula is used:</p>
            <p>(local money √ó other standard) √∑ local standard = other money.</p>
            <p>For example: You wish to calculate how much ¬£100, <name type="place">New Jersey</name> money, would be worth in English currency. The sterling
               standard is 54d. to the Spanish milled dollar, whereas the <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, or local standard is 90d.</p>
            <p>(¬£100 <name type="place">New Jersey</name> √ó 54) √∑ 90 = ¬£60 sterling</p>
            <p>If you now want to find how much the ¬£100 in <name type="place">New Jersey</name> money would fetch in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> where the
               Spanish milled dollar is rated at 72d., then</p>
            <p>(¬£100 <name type="place">New Jersey</name> √ó 72) √∑ 90 = ¬£80 <name type="place">New England</name> money of account.</p>
            <p>In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, where the Spanish milled dollar costs 96d. in local currency, the calculation would now be,</p>
            <p>(¬£100 <name type="place">New Jersey</name> √ó 96) √∑ 90 = ¬£106.60 <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> money.</p>
            <pb n="262"/>
            <p>These conversions were made easier for citizens of the period who had access to printed reference tables and mathematical methods such as those

               <p>[This is a very interesting computation. The ¬£152 is divided by 3 and the whole number answer is "50" with a remainder of ¬£2, or 40s. The 40s.
                  is added to the 15s. for 55s. and then divided by 6. The nearest whole number is "9," which is added to the "50" and the answer is "509." The
                  whole dollars are expressed as 509 dollars, but the remainder is 1 shilling 6 pence, 1/6, which remains in the old money of account. One
                  shilling and six pence, or 18d., equals 25¬¢ when there are 6s., or 72d., to the dollar. The answer could have been expressed $509.25, but

            <div2 xml:id="d1e47164" type="backma">
               <p>ARBITRATION OF EXCHANGES</p>
               <q>By this term [arbitration of exchanges] is understood how to choose, or determine the best way of remitting money from abroad with advantage;
                  which is performed by conjointed proportion : thus,</q>
               <q>Suppose a Merchant has effects at <name type="place">Amsterdam</name> to the amount of 3530 dollars, which he can remit by way of <name

                  Or, by way of Nantz at 5 2/5 livres per dollar, and thence to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> at 6s. 8d. per [French] crown : It is required
                  to arbitrate these exchanges, that is, to choose that which is most advantageous?</q>
               <p>1 Dollar at <name type="place">Amsterdam</name> = 840 Rees at <name type="place">Lisbon</name>.</p>
               <p>1000 Rees at <name type="place">Lisbon</name> = 97d. at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> [8s. 1d.]</p>

               </p>

               <p>(5 2/5 √ó 80 √ó 3530) √∑ 1 √ó 6 = ¬£ 1059 by way of Nantz</p>
               <q>Here it may be observed that the difference is ¬£139 8s. 8.4d. in favor of remitting by way of <name type="place">Lisbon</name> rather than by
                  Nantz, which depends on the course of exchange, at that time; but the course may vary so, that, in a short time, by way of Nantz may be
                  better; hence appears the necessity and advantage of an extensive correspondence, to acquire a thorough knowledge in the course of exchange,
                  to make this kind of remittance.</q>
               <p>Apparently in 1786, barter was still of sufficient importance in commerce for <name type="pname">Pike</name> to include instructions in his
                  book of how to perform this without incurring loss. Typical problems he solves are: "How much Tea at 9s. 6d. per lb. must be given in barter
                  for 156 gallons of wine, at 12s. 31/2d. per gallon?" Following conversion of the value of the wine into 23,010 pence, the answer is given as
                  201 lb. 13 54/114 oz. of tea.</p>
               <p>Barter could also be complicated when hard coin or "ready" money was also a factor in the transaction as illustrated in the following
                  examples:</p>
               <q>Two Merchants barter; A has 30 Cwt. of cheese at 23s. 6d. per Cwt. and B has 9 Pieces of Broadcloth, at ¬£3 15s. per piece; which must receive
                  money, and how much? (Answer: B must pay A ¬£1 10s.)</q>
               <q>A has Ribbands [ribbons] at 2s. per yard ready money; but in barter he will have 2s. 3d. B has broadcloth at 32s. 6d. per yard ready money: -
                  At what rate must B value his Cloth per yard, to be equivalent to A's bartering Price, and how many yards of Ribband, at 2s. 3d. per yard,
                  must then be given by A for 488 yards of B's Broadcloth? (Answer, B values his broadcloth, at ¬£1 16s. 61/2d. per yard; A must give B 7930
                  yards of ribbon for 488 yards of cloth.)</q>
               <p>Another important conversion used frequently is as follows: if copper halfpence passed in <name type="place">England</name> at 24 to the
                  shilling, how many such halfpence would pass for a local <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling so that the relative values would remain
                  equal?</p>
               <p>(English standard √∑, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> standard) √ó sterling amount = <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> money</p>
               <p>Thus: (54d. √∑ 96d.) √ó 24 halfpence = 13.5 halfpence</p>
               <pb n="266"/>
               <p>Hence at 14 halfpence to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling prior to August 1, 1787, these coppers were slightly undervalued in
                  terms of sterling.</p>
               <p>A second example converts state money to its sterling equivalent:</p>
               <p>In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> after August 1, 1787, coppers were valued at 20 to the local shilling. If one received 20 genuine
                  British halfpence at that rate, how much would that sum be worth if exported to <name type="place">England</name>?</p>
               <p>To convert from an American value to sterling, the formula would read</p>
               <p>(<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> standard √∑ English standard) √ó <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> amount = Sterling value</p>
               <p>(96d. √∑ 54d.) √ó 20 halfpence = 35.6 halfpence</p>
               <p>Thus the 20 genuine British halfpence circulating in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> after the devaluation of coppers were highly
                  undervalued. If one could buy 20 regal halfpence for a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> shilling, this sum would be equivalent to 35.6
                  halfpence when converted to the sterling shilling for a 48.3% increase in investment if exported to <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
               <p>or 35.6 halfpence ‚àí 24 halfpence to the English shilling = 11.6</p>
               <p>11.6 √∑ 24 = 48.3% gain</p>
               <p>Now if the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> rate increased to 24 coppers to the local shilling, then the calculation is as</p>
               <p>follows: (96d. √∑ 54d.) √ó 24 halfpence = 42.7 halfpence</p>
               <p>and when exported to <name type="place">England</name>
               </p>
               <p>42.7 ‚àí 24 = 18.7, 18.7 √∑ 24 = 77.9% gain.</p>
               <p>When the exchange rate for halfpence in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name> was advanced to 48 to the local shilling in August 1789, the
                  scenario was as follows:</p>
               <p>(96d. √∑ 54d.) √ó 48 = 85.3.</p>
               <p>At this rate if genuine English coppers were bought up and returned to <name type="place">England</name> the profit to the exporter would
                  be</p>
               <p>85.3 ‚àí 24 = 61.3, 61.3 √∑ 24 = 255.6% profit!</p>
               <p>These calculations demonstrate that the very process of devaluating the halfpence in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</name>, while designed to
                  discourage the currency of lightweight counterfeits, actually drove the genuine issues of proper weight out of circulation and probably back
                  to <name type="place">England</name> for a handsome profit.</p>

               <lb/> Summary of Overstruck Coppers</head>
            <p>Frequent mention has been made in this book of the economic advantage from overstriking existing coppers to give them a new identity. Appendix 2
               catalogues all known state coppers overstruck on host coins in an attempt to understand better the pattern of this practice which was not as
               haphazard as it might appear at first glance. Table 27 lists the <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers overstruck on host coins. The <name
                  type="place">Rupert</name> mint used <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers as planchets for three of its four 1787 issues, the
               exception being <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 34 (<name type="pname">Bressett</name> 10-J) for which only three specimens are known.
               It is easier to visualize this process of overstriking when the coins are studied according to their emission sequence from the mint as indicated
               by the new <name type="pname">Bressett</name> nomenclature.<ref target="#APP2-n1">1</ref> Hence, there are none for 10-J, occasionally for 10-K,
               nearly always for 11-K and frequently for 12-K, and none thereafter for the 1788 dies. The <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 3 over a
                  <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and the <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 15 on the landscape <name type="pname"
                  >Ryder-Richardson</name> 4 seem to be interesting incidents without pattern or logic.</p>
            <p>After mid-1787, <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers were simultaneously minted at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> after the two
               mints entered into a business arrangement. The <name type="place">Newburgh</name> operation used Irish halfpence, dated 1781 and 1782, as
               planchets for six of their products but weight analysis shows most of the host coins to be counterfeit. The only recorded exception to this
               practice is the presence of a single <name type="pname">Bressett</name> 19-X (<name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 18) appearing over a
               1785 <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> copper. There is a pattern to these emissions as described by <name type="pname"
               >Bressett</name>.</p>
            <p>After July 1787 until 1788, the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>
               <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers were those muled with, or similar to the imitation halfpence, viz. <name type="pname"
                  >Ryder-Richardson</name> 13 and 27 (<name type="pname">Bressett</name> 17-V and 18-W). These two <name type="place">Vermonts</name> and all
               the imitation halfpence appear on original planchets, with a solitary exception recorded in Table 30. Many 1788 and 1789 <name type="place"
                  >Vermont</name> coppers may be found minted over Irish halfpence with the three exceptions of <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 24
                  (<name type="pname">Bressett</name> 16-S), the final issues of <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 25 (<name type="pname"
                  >Bressett</name> 16-U) and the last use of <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 29 (<name type="pname">Bressett</name> 22-U). But why
               were no imitation halfpence struck on host coins? It is possible that those issues had ceased production by that time rather than for any
               aesthetic motives of the mintmaster. Hence the pattern is established that the overstriking at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> on Irish
               halfpence occurred for a short period in 1788 and into 1789, usually with dies that failed early since there are so many rarities in this group.
               A practical reason why these dies failed early could have been due to the fact that the host coins were not annealed or softened prior to
               overstriking. Thus this copper was "too work-hardened to readily take the new image, and ... [it] would also have been especially hard on the
               dies, and might have contributed to early failure."<ref target="#APP2-n2">2</ref> On the contrary, the <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
               <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56-n coinage was so prolific and contained so many overstrikes that it suggests a different and more
               sophisticated process which preserved the longevity of the dies. The last overstruck copper must have been <name type="pname">Bressett</name>
               16-U (<name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 25) since further use of the U reverse is not associated with Irish halfpence and the 16 obverse
               with the "horned bust" die break is then wedded to the old <name type="place">Rupert</name> S reverse to produce the common <name type="pname"
                  >Ryder-Richardson</name> 24 or <name type="pname">Bressett</name> 16-S. The remainder of the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>
               <name type="place">Vermont</name> coinage consists of "muled, worn, or rejected dies," all on original but frequently defective planchets. In
               summary, it <pb n="268"/> appears that the <name type="place">Rupert</name> mint in 1787, used <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name>
               undertypes, first occasionally, and then exclusively. The practice abruptly stopped for the 1788 issues. During parts of 1788 and 1789, the <name
                  type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>
               <name type="place">Vermont</name> coinages are extant on (probable) counterfeit Irish halfpence for six emissions and then this practice suddenly
               stops with <name type="pname">Ryder-Richardson</name> 24 (<name type="pname">Bressett</name> 16-S). It is not revived again despite the
               continuous deterioration in the quality of the coinages from <name type="place">Newburgh</name>. This would suggest that the supply of Irish
               halfpence was exhausted. One consistent feature of these <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers is that each mint employed just one kind of
               host coin, the <name type="place">Rupert</name> mint using the <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers and <name type="pname"
                  >Machin's Mills</name>, the Irish halfpence, for which many counterfeits were known to have existed.<ref target="#APP2-n3">3</ref> This
               consistency will be addressed again.</p>
            <p>Table 28 shows the occurrence of two reported 1787 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> overstrikes which does not indicate a trend but probably
               just a extraordinary event at the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company mint. There are so many 1787 <name type="pname">Miller</name> 33
               coppers that certainly more overstruck issues would have surfaced if overstriking had been a motive of that mint. The 1788 <name type="place"
                  >Connecticut</name> coppers which appear overstruck on <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers are the first Mailed Bust Right
               coppers, which bear great resemblance to their <name type="place">Vermont</name> and imitation halfpence cousins, and next the Triple Leaves
               busts by <name type="pname">Buell</name>. The 1788 Draped Bust Left <name type="place">Connecticut</name>, <name type="pname">Miller</name>
               16.3-N, may rarely be seen over a counterfeit <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cent. A review of <name type="pname">Spilman</name>'s Die
               Analysis Chart places these coins in distinct groupings,<ref target="#APP2-n4">4</ref> some of which are doubtlessly from <name type="pname"
                  >Machin's Mills</name>.<ref target="#APP2-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Trudgen</name> presents a chronology of the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> output and notes that both the <name
                  type="place">Vermont</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series were minted from mid-1788 into late 1789, a sequence which was
               followed by the <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
               <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 to 58-n "camel heads."<ref target="#APP2-n6">6</ref> It seems curious that <name type="pname">Captain
                  Machin</name> would have reserved the <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> host coins for the <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
               series, the counterfeit Irish halfpence exclusively for his <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers, while impressing the <name type="place"
                  >New Jersey</name> coins over every type and description of lightweight coppers current in that period, including some of his own products.
               This was also accomplished without any apparent mixing of host coin "planchets." In addition, the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coinages
               would have been simultaneous with the terminal, inferior <name type="place">Vermont</name> emissions which do not appear overstruck. How could
               all these various activities and styles of production have occurred within the same mint?</p>
            <p>One sure fact is that the <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers came from <name type="place">Newburgh</name> at that time. Since it seems
               unlikely that an illegal mint would have remained so fastidious in the way that "blanks" were fed into the presses there must be another
               explanation for the distinct host coin "personalities" of the 1788 <name type="place">Connecticuts</name> and "camel head" <name type="place">New
                  Jersey</name> coppers if they were to have originated at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> near the same time. An unlikely explanation
               would be an excellent quality control program at the mint which kept all the host coins isolated from each other. In modern times, batches of
               planchets may become mixed up and fed into the wrong presses. I find it difficult to conceive that the <name type="place">Vermont</name> series
               on Irish halfpence, the "camel heads," and the 1788 <name type="place">Connecticuts</name> overstruck on <name type="place">Constellatio
                  Nova</name> coppers came from the same manufacturing process. The most logical answer is that the three minting operations were separated from
               each other, either in time or place. Since the "camel head" series appears on host coins similar to the practice of the <name type="place"
                  >Elizabethtown</name> mint, it is my opinion that <name type="pname">Maris</name> 56 to 58-n came either from that location or one with the
               technological capacity to harden dies and anneal host planchets.</p>
            <p>The three series that used <name type="place">Constellatio Nova</name> coppers were the 1787 <name type="place">Vermont</name>s, the 1788 Mailed
               Bust Right <name type="place">Connecticuts</name>, and the 1788 Triple Leaves <name type="place">Connecticuts</name>. The <name type="place"
                  >Vermont</name> issues were from <name type="place">Rupert</name> while the last two were from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>, but
               separated in time from the <pb n="269"/>
               <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers struck over Irish halfpence. The very rare 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> Draped Bust Left
               overstruck on the counterfeit <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cent, itself a possible <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> creation,
               bears similar features to other coppers which originated in <name type="place">Newburgh</name> and stands within that grouping in <name
                  type="pname">Spilman</name>'s Die Analysis Chart. Since a genuine <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cent would have been heavier than
               the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> standard, a minter would not have used a legitimate cent as host for a lighter coin.</p>
            <p>The <name type="place">New Jersey</name> overstrikes are an entirely different situation as compared to the relatively uniform host coins of
                  <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name>. Table 29 reveals a disordered array of contemporary coppers with
               the notable exception of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and Fugio cents, due to their greater intrinsic weight. Apparently anything
               lesser in value than the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> standard was a potential candidate to become a host coin. The reason for striking
               the <name type="pname">Maris</name> 34-V over the 34-J and 35-J is illusive, the V reverse being inferior in execution to the J.</p>

            <p>Note: Sources frequently list English or Irish halfpence undertypes without any opinion or comment as to whether they are considered genuine or
               counterfeit. Weight documentation would be helpful to assist in this determination.</p>
            <p>The overstruck <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers fall into two major groups, the first being the <name type="place"
                  >Elizabethtown</name> emissions from June 1789 into 1790. The dies used were remnants from the old <name type="place">Rahway</name> operation
               and the planchets were anything lighter than the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> standard which could be purchased, probably at significant
               discount since after July 20, 1787, nothing but <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers were negotiable in that state.<ref target="#APP2-n7"
                  >7</ref> It became profitable for the <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> minters to <pb n="270"/> impress acceptable designs over any
               lighter coppers and pass them off on the unsuspecting. The second group of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> overstrikes, <name type="pname"
                  >Maris</name> 56 to 58-n, has already been mentioned. <name type="pname">Breen</name>
               <ref target="#APP2-n8">8</ref> attributes this group to <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> whereas <name type="pname">Anton</name>
               <ref target="#APP2-n9">9</ref> regards them as an <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> product. Because the host coin characteristics of these
               coppers is so different from the practices of the <name type="place">Newburgh</name> mint, I would support the <name type="place"
                  >Elizabethtown</name> hypothesis. If the "camel heads" came from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> at the time indicated by <name
                  type="pname">Trudgen</name>, they would have coincided chronologically with the <name type="place">Vermont</name> series overstruck on
               counterfeit Irish halfpence or the last <name type="place">Vermont</name> issues from old, rejected dies which were on original planchets. The
               only way that these <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers could have come from <name type="place">Newburgh</name> is if they were the last
               product of that mint, issued when all other operations had ceased.</p>
            <p>These conclusions as to the mint of origin for those coppers overstruck over other coins are only speculative but are supported by examination of
               the style in which the host coins were used and the characteristics of the mint in question. Not only are the identities of these mints still
               shrouded in doubt, but there is still mystery regarding the origin of many other coppers, even with normal planchets. An accurate assignment of
               mints is difficult, but perhaps with advanced techniques, such as energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, there will be more reliable
               methods to study these undertypes and planchets.<ref target="#APP2-n10">10</ref> At any rate, speculation, controversy, and doubt serve us well
               if they spur us on to further research in this fascinating period of numismatic history!</p>

               <lb/> Assay Calculations</head>
            <p>The Proclamation of 1704 was an attempt to fix the exchange rates of European silver coins circulating in <name type="place">British North
                  America</name> based on their silver content priced at 5s. 2d. per troy ounce of sterling (.925 fine) silver. These assays were made at the
               Tower Mint under the able guidance of <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Newton</name>. Other of <name type="pname">Newton</name>'s calculations have
               been used in the construction of Tables 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Since these assay results were so important in the establishment of foreign exchange,
               it is interesting to review the mathematical methods used in their derivations.</p>
            <p>In regard to silver coin, the quality of its composition, or degree of purity, is expressed in millesimal fineness, 1000 fine being 100% silver.
               Sterling silver contains 925 parts of pure silver and is debased with 75 parts of alloy, usually copper. This can be expressed .925 fine, 925.0
               millesimal fineness, or 92.5% silver. A typical assay report prepared by <name type="pname">Newton</name> at the Tower Mint would read as
               follows:</p>

               <head>EXPLANATION OF <name type="pname">NEWTON</name>'S ASSAYS</head>
               <p>Unfortunately such tables as this appear without any explanations. In order to decipher these values, one can proceed as follows:</p>
               <p>For the Dutch three guilders the given measurements are:</p>
               <q>Weight of actual coin, 20 Dwt. 8 gr. = 188.0 gr.</q>
               <q>Weight of standard, 20 Dwt. 3 gr. 12 mites = 483.6 grains; this is the assayed weight of the sterling silver (.925 fine) in the coin. A mite
                  is 1/20 grain.</q>
               <q>Therefore, setting up a proportion,</q>
               <q>sterling silver weight : 0.925 :: weight of coin : coin's fineness, or (standard weight √ó 0.925) √∑ weight = fineness of the foreign coin, or
                  (483.6 √ó 0.925) √∑ 488.0 = 0.91666 fine</q>
               <q>The Dutch three guilder piece is .91666 fine, that is, its composition is not quite as pure as sterling at .925 fine.</q>
               <p>For the assay results as recorded by <name type="pname">Newton</name> in column one, one is looking for the difference between the actual
                  silver content in a troy pound of the test coin, in this case at .91666 fine, and a troy pound of sterling silver.</p>
               <q>One troy pound of pure silver contains 5760 grains of silver.</q>
               <q>One troy pound of sterling silver contains (5760 √ó 0.925) = 5328 grains of pure silver.</q>
               <q>One troy pound of .91666 fine silver contains (5760 √ó 0.91666) = 5280 grains of pure silver.</q>
               <p>Then each troy pound of three guilder pieces of 188.0 grains lacks 48 grains of being of sterling fineness (5328 - 5280 = 48). Therefore, the
                  assay column has a "'W' Dwt. 2" meaning that coin is "weak" by 2 Dwt., or 48 grains, of achieving the sterling standard per troy pound.</p>
               <p>Since the three guilder piece has an equivalent of 483.6 grains of sterling, and one ounce (480 grains) of sterling was valued at 62.0d., the
                  value in English money for the Dutch test coin is derived by a simple proportion:</p>
               <q>480 : 483.6 :: 62.0 : √ó or,</q>
               <q>√ó = (483.6 √ó 62.0) √∑ 480 or, 62.46d, as in the last column.</q>
               <p>So in summary, the Dutch three guilder piece, was slightly "weaker" than sterling fineness but its actual weight was so great that it
                  contained slightly more than an equivalent ounce of sterling silver placing it over 62.0d.</p>
               <p>These calculations can be carried out for the other coins represented in the chart. The actual weight of the ducaton (ducatoon) is 501.0
                  grains, and the weight of the equivalent amount of sterling silver is 507.75 grains. The fineness of the ducatoon is (507.75 √ó 0.925) √∑ 501 =
                  0.93746 fine.</p>
               <p>One troy pound of pure silver from ducatoons weighs 5399.78 grains which is 71.78 grains heavier, or "stronger," "S," in silver content than
                  one troy pound of sterling silver. This value of 71.78 grains, or 2.99 Dwt., is rounded up to 3 Dwt. At 62.0d. per ounce for sterling, this
                  large coin with a standard weight of 507.75 grains would fetch 65.58d. which <name type="pname">Newton</name> reported as 65.59d.</p>
               <p>The lion dollar is a coin of low silver content since the actual weight of a single specimen was 422 grains, and the equivalent in sterling
                  weighed 338.35 grains. The fineness calculates out as .74164. A troy pound of such coins would have 4271.86 grains of pure silver which is
                  1056.13 grains (44 Dwt.) less, "weaker," than the pure silver in a pound of sterling. The assay column thus records "'W' 44 Dwt." The 338.35
                  grains of silver equivalent to sterling would be worth 43.7d.</p>
               <p>The gold assay, expressed in carats and carat-grains, is more complicated. The term carat represents the relative amount of gold in a mixture,
                  or alloy, a carat being 1/24 of the total <pb n="277"/> weight. Therefore, anything which is pure gold is 24 carat, or if 50% gold, it is 12
                  carat. Purity of gold can also be expressed in fineness as is silver. Twenty-two carat gold, or 22/24, would thus be .91666 fine.</p>
               <p>The English standard for gold was 22 carats, or .91666 fine. The last column indicates that the value for gold of this purity was ¬£4 per
                  ounce.</p>
               <q>For the Spanish pistole,</q>
               <q>Gross weight per coin was 4 Dwt. 8 grains, or 104 grains.</q>
               <q>The equivalent weight of 22 carat gold standard in the coin was 4 Dwt. 7 grains, 8 mites, or 103.4 grains.</q>
               <q>The millesimal fineness of the gold in the pistole can be solved by the following proportion:</q>
               <q>weight of 22 carat gold : 0.91666 :: weight of coin : coin's fineness, or (standard weight √ó 0.91666) √∑ coin weight = fineness of foreign
                  coin, or (103.4 √ó 0.91666) √∑ 104.0 = 0.91138 fine, or 21.87 carat gold.</q>
               <p>Calculation of the assay in column one similarly is the difference in the weight of one troy pound of test coins and a pound of gold standard
                  at a purity of 22 carat, or .91666 fine.</p>
               <q>A troy pound of 24 carat gold contains 5760 grains pure gold.</q>
               <q>A troy pound of 22 carat gold contains 5280 grains of pure gold.</q>
               <q>The pistole at .91138 fine contains 5249.5 grains of pure gold.</q>
               <q>The difference is 5280 - 5249.5 = 30.45 grains.</q>
               <p>The interpretation of the gold assay is complex because of the use of the archaic unit of measurement, the carat-grain, but a key was provided
                  to help with this conversion.<ref target="#APP3-n2">2</ref>

               <p>The pistole fineness is 30.45 grains less, or "weaker" than the standard. From the conversion chart above, this is roughly equal to 1/2
                  Carat-Grain, 0.125 Carat, or 30 grains. This quantity is expressed in the assay column of the table by "W" and "0 1/2 Carat-Grain."</p>
               <p>The value of the gold in the pistole at the rate of ¬£4 (80s.) per ounce (480 grains) .91666 standard is calculated by the proportion:</p>
               <q>weight of standard in coin : 480 grains :: value in s. : 80s.</q>
               <q>(103.4 √ó 80) √∑ 480 = 17.23s. = 17s. 2.8d.</q>
               <p>Similarly the calculation for the very popular Portuguese coin, the moeda, or moidore, can be carried out. This coin weighs 165 grains and the
                  equivalent weight of 22 carat gold in the coin is 164.55 grains. This coin falls short of standard purity at .914 fine or 21.94 carat. A troy
                  pound <pb n="278"/> at this purity would contain 5264.6 grains of pure gold, or 15.36 grains less than standard. This value is, therefore,
                  "weaker," "W," by "0 1/4 Carat-grain" as noted in the assay column.</p>
               <p>For the gold ducat of Campen, the actual weight is 53.5 grains, but there is an equivalent of 57.15 grains of standard. For this to be the
                  case, this coin is obviously purer than the 22 carat standard and figures out to .97919 fine, or practically pure gold at 23.5 carat. A troy
                  pound of such ducats contains 360 grains more pure gold than the standard which according to the conversion scale "stronger" by "1 carat" (240
                  grains) and "2 carat-grains" (120 grains). The value of this coin relative to the standard is 9s. 6.3d.</p>

               <lb/> Weight Distribution Analyses of Confederation Coppers</head>
            <p>The purpose for tabulating the weights of the 4,300 Confederation coppers in Table 21 was to determine whether these coins met the weight
               standard prescribed by the respective state legislatures. The major problem in interpreting the results is that no documentation from any
               Confederation mint exists which affirms if any weight variance from the standard was permitted under the contract. Based on the experience from
               the Tower Mint, it has been assumed that an average weight deviation less than 5% for any series of Confederation coppers is probably justifiable
               considering the imprecision of late eighteenth century domestic planchet technology. Such a variance should not necessarily raise the suspicion
               of dishonesty by the mintmaster. It is just as likely that overweight planchets were due to the inability to roll the copper fillets sufficiently
               thin, and hence there is a wide distribution of planchet weights as seen on the following curves. In general, weight for base coinages was
               calculated on the number of pieces per pound rather than on the basis of individual coins. For the most part, the average weights of coppers from
               authorized mints were very close to their required standards whereas those from illegal operations made no attempt to give fair measure. The
               other important benefit from Table 21 is that conformity in planchet weights can be studied; those coppers with a lower first standard deviation
               have more consistency in weight as a group indicating greater uniformity in planchet size. This regularity confirms greater consistency and
               better quality control in planchet manufacture typical of a more technologically sophisticated operation. If different populations of planchet
               weights become evident when plotting any weight distribution curve, it is suggestive that such coppers were minted from different stock and
               perhaps those varieties may not be as closely related as assumed. There are several examples of two or more planchet populations, corresponding
               to specific coin varieties in the following charts.</p>
            <p>A typical distribution curve is seen for <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> cents, in Chart 5. These 156 coppers are arranged in ascending
               order of weight, the lightest one weighing 134.6 grains and the heaviest, 185 grains. This is the range of weight. The middle, or median, coin in
               this arrangement, number 78, happens to weigh 154.3. The average of all 156 specimens is 153.9 grains; 34.13% of the specimens on either side of
               the average comprise the statistical expression for the first standard deviation, or 68.26% of the entire sample. In this instance, the value
               34.13% below the mean is 144.8 grains, indicated by the left arrow, and for that 34.13% above the mean is 162.9, marked by the right arrow. This
               quantity is written 153.9 ¬±9.1. This sample of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> coppers conforms very well to the bell-shaped curve of
               normal distribution and the mean is within 2.3% of the required 157.5 grains.</p>

            <p>
               <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> half cents (Chart 6), also made at the same state operated facility, while conforming to a normal
               distribution curve, fall about 2.9% below the standard. For comparison, Chart 7 indicates the weight distribution for 47 mostly uncirculated
                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> halfpence from the Tower Mint. It is known that while individual coppers in the <name type="place"
                  >Virginia</name> series were allowed to vary by as much as 3.33% from the standard of 116.7 grains, it was expected that the entire output
               would conform to the authorized weight. In this sample the mean is slightly greater than the standard. In our analysis of Confederation coppers,
               we have been more liberal in our expectations and have suggested that a 5% deficiency in average weight of the entire sample was probably
               justifiable since planchet manufacture in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> was not as advanced as in <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
            <p>The Fugio coppers have been well studied. The weight distribution curve for 675 Fine Rays specimens is presented in Chart 8. This symmetrical
               curve indicates a normal distribution pattern but the average weight falls 4.8% below the required standard. Since the <name type="pname"
                  >Jarvis</name> Mint was known to have employed some unethical practices in obtaining the patent, it remains a matter of speculation whether
               this deficiency in weight was intentional or due to mechanical imprecision of planchet preparation. The average values for the Round Club Rays in
               Chart 9 are the same but the sample is much smaller and the curve less reliable. Only 19 of the rare Concave Club Rays specimens are available
               for study in Chart 10. The shape of the curve may not be meaningful due to the small sample size but the average is significantly greater than in
               the two previous examples. Since these coppers do not appear to have the same planchet fabric as the other two Fugio types, it is safe to
               conclude they were minted under different auspices.</p>

            <p>As noted in Chart 11, the <name type="place">Rahway</name> coppers also conform to a normal distribution. Other issues attributed to that mint,
               the Heads Left group (Chart 12), and the Coulterless varieties (Chart 13) have fewer specimens and so the double peaks on their curves lack
               significance. Most late <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name> coppers (1789 to 1791) were struck over lighter host coins, and thus no helpful
               information can be gained from planchet weight analysis since so few virgin flans were employed.</p>
            <p>The coppers attributed to <name type="pname">Brasher</name> and <name type="pname">Bailey</name> were slightly (4.1%) below the standard as a
               group but certainly more hearty than the overstruck and counterfeit varieties. The fact that these issues had a reverse animal figure, either a
               horse or fox, believed by some to be a mintmark, indicated that their authors were willing to be traced. There is some evidence of collaboration
               with <name type="pname">Walter Mould</name> in the production of these coppers (Chart 14).</p>
            <p>The 1787 and 1788 coppers attributed to the <name type="place">Morristown</name> Mint have entirely different weight characteristics. Those from
               1787 (Chart 15) show a normal distribution curve whereas the double peak from the next year (Chart 16) indicates a mixed population. Analysis of
               the right peak shows that it is comprised of 22 <name type="pname">Maris</name> 67-v coppers which are significantly heavier than the other 17
               for that year. The immediate implication is that these two groups were not struck on the same planchet stock and possibly were not from the same
               mint. This is an area for additional research where energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometric analysis of the planchets would be very
               enlightening.</p>

            <p>The <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series is the largest and most varied of all the Confederation coppers. The 134 1785 Mailed Bust Right
               coppers and 160 1785/6 Mailed Bust Left coppers, all from the Company for Coining Coppers, are so similar in weight, they are combined as Group
               10a in Table 21 and their respective curves are represented in Charts 17-18. These issues fall 6% below the standard, which is larger than the
               allowable 5%, but it has been postulated that this deficiency was due to technological problems in rolling planchet stock to the required
               dimension rather than a deliberate effort to deceive.</p>
            <p>The 1787 Draped Bust Left issues are the most common <name type="place">Connecticut</name> type coin. Although <name type="pname">Abel
                  Buell</name> cut all the dies, the coins struck are not a homogeneous population in regard to weight and at least two mints were involved. In
               the previous two charts, it was observed that the Company for Coining Coppers used lightweight planchets in 1785 and into 1786. Starting with the
               rare 1786 Draped Bust Left coppers, it appears that the planchet weight exceeds the standard. This may have occurred during the time when the
               Company for Coining Coppers leased their equipment to another group of contractors. Then in 1787 (Chart 19) the Company for Coining Coppers
               resumed the Draped Bust Left design with essentially full weight coins. These issues are identified by the large lettering in the legends. The
               next Draped Bust Left coppers in order of emission are those with small lettering and crosses in the legends (Chart 20) but it is uncertain
               whether they are products of the Company for Coining Coppers or their successor in business, <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company. These
               are full weight and in fact exhibit a double peak to the curve. The lower segment of the right peak, averaging 151.9 grains, is <name
                  type="pname">Miller</name> 17-g.3 and then <name type="pname">Miller</name> 24-g.3 at 152.9 grains. The upper half of the right peak contains
               the <name type="pname">Miller</name> 24-FF specimens at 156.0 grains while in the uppermost limb rest the <name type="pname">Miller</name> 38-GG
               coppers at an average 156.1 grains. Although these varieties seem to have very definite weight characteristics, they are few in number and it
               will require the analysis of more specimens either to confirm or refute these observations.</p>

                  in the Legends. The right peak is the heavier 17-g.3, 24-g.3, 24-FF and 38-GG varieties. Group 11b in Table 21. (See <ref target="#fig-118"

            <p>The second group of small lettering 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers to be issued were those with fleurons in the legends (Chart 21). These almost
               reach the standard but in any case are heavier than the last group with cinquefoils in Chart 22 from the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> mint.
               This large collection of 610 specimens forms a normal distribution curve which is similar to Chart 8, the Fine Rays Fugios which were from the
               same mint. Since <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> could manufacture Fugio planchets at 150.0 grains, he should have been able to cut <name
                  type="place">Connecticut</name> planchets at 144.0 grains rather than at 134.6. It appears that the 6.5% reduction below the standard was
               purposeful. The Draped Bust Left motif was next used by the illegal <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> mint (Chart 23) for the 1788-dated
               varieties of that type. These coins were well below the standard and without doubt the reduction in weight was designed to deceive the
               public.</p>
            <p>There were a large number of contemporaneous counterfeit <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers minted by clandestine operations which not
               only skimped on the metal content of the coins but also ignored the 10% royalty required by the state from the authorized patentees. These
               spurious issues include the 1786 Mailed Bust Right coppers attributed to <name type="pname">Atlee</name> (group 12 Table 21), the Mutton-heads
               (group 14), all the 1788 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, and the 1787 coppers which share common punches with <name type="pname"
                  >Walter Mould</name>'s <name type="place">Morristown</name> emissions, namely <name type="pname">Miller</name> 1787 1.3-L, 4-L, 6.1-M, and
               6.2-M. Of the 64 such specimens in Chart 24, a distinct double peak is observed with the heavier 4-L on the right, although both are well below
               the authorized standard. This observation suggests that two populations of planchets were used and that the four varieties, although punch and
               die-linked together, were not minted simultaneously.</p>

            <p>The <name type="place">Connecticut</name> Triple Leaves dies were also engraved by <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name> but much less is certain
               as to where the coppers with these designs were minted. For those dated 1787 there are two distinct populations (Chart 25). Those designated
                  <name type="pname">Miller</name> 2-B, 9-E, 10-E,<ref target="#APP4-n1">1</ref> 11-E, and 11-K approach full weight and comprise the right
               segment of the curve while all others fall well below the standard and are similar to those 1788-dated issues (Chart 26). There are several
               possibilities to explain these observations. Perhaps the heavier 1787 coppers were from a yet unidentified legitimate operation, concerned for
               legal weight, and the lightweight 1787-dated varieties, likely from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>, were back-dated since their
               planchet weight is similar to the 1788-dated varieties. In 1788, after <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s residual equipment was relinquished to
                  <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>, the light 1787 Triple Leaves, the 1788 Triple Leaves, and the 1788 Draped Bust Left coppers all
               could have been minted at that location. It is evident that this study has just scratched the surface of Confederation planchet analysis. It will
               require further investigation with die emission sequence and actual constituent metal examination to answer these questions.</p>
            <p>Numismatists familiar with Confederation coppers are aware that poor quality and inconsistent planchets are typical within the <name type="place"
                  >Vermont</name> series. Chart 27 shows a wide range in planchet weights for the 1785/6 landscape varieties with the mean weight well in excess
               of the authorized standard of 111.0 grains. The bust issues from the <name type="place">Rupert</name> Mint (Chart 28), those from <name
                  type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> (Chart 29) and the <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> halfpence (Chart 30) are very similar in weight

            <p>
               <name type="pname">John Beale Bordley</name>, a prominent <name type="place">Maryland</name> lawyer, judge, and agriculturist, lived from 1727 to
                  1804.<ref target="#APP5-n1">1</ref> His early education was very broad and he remained keenly interested in many diverse subjects,
               particularly those related to agricultural practices. He owned and operated what might be considered a large scale experimental farm where he
               introduced new and imported methods and technologies. From 1784 to 1799, he published three books describing his experiences, while in 1785, he
               was instrumental in the formation of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> Society for Promoting Agriculture. In addition to his
               encouragement of agriculture, <name type="pname">Bordley</name> was also concerned about the coinage of the new nation. In 1789, he wrote a
               series of articles for <hi rend="italic">The <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Mercury, and Universal Advertiser</hi> on his proposals for a
               new coinage system for the <name type="place">United States</name> and included as well his thoughts on standards for weights and measures.</p>
            <p>The first of these articles, which appeared in the June 27, 1789 issue, dealt with his notions for simplifing the silver currency. In essence he
               proposed that the <name type="place">United States</name> adopt the sterling standard of .925 fine silver which he called the "commercial
               standard" since it was equal to the standard of the commercial countries, <name type="place">Britain</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>,
                  <name type="place">Holland</name>, and <name type="place">Spain</name>, which were <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>'s chief trading partners.
               His comments were based on the 1716 assays of <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Newton</name> of these foreign currencies.<ref target="#APP5-n2"
                  >2</ref> The Spanish milled dollar, which remained the western world's silver standard, was pegged at 53.87d., sterling, an odd value which
               complicated computations.<ref target="#APP5-n3">3</ref>
               <name type="pname">Bordley</name> opined that if the prospective American sterling dollar weighed 386 grains, then it would be worth 50d.,
               sterling, a parity which would make the American cent equal to one English halfpenny. This equity would facilitate the conversion of English
               pounds, shillings, and pence into American currency through division by decimals. <name type="pname">Bordley</name> demonstrated his decimal
               method by converting a debt of ¬£54 6s. 8d., sterling, into "Congress money." The sum contained 26080 English halfpence or 26080 American cents at
               the new proposed standard. When divided by tens, accomplished by moving a "series of dots," the 26080 cents became 260.8.0. or 260 dollars, 8
               dimes, and no cents. The 260 dollars could be further reduced to 26 eagles, or 26.0.8.0. by further division by ten. Individual state monies of
               account would first require conversion into their English sterling equivalent before the resulting value could be reduced further into halfpence
               or cents and then expressed in the new "Congress dollars, dimes, and cents" by manipulation of the "dots." Being true to his vocation as a sheep
               farmer and ever mindful of the commodity value of wool in the economy, <name type="pname">Bordley</name> suggested that the device on the new
               coin be a "wooled sheep," implying a "fleece" which he suggested as a suitable name for the proposed silver coin.</p>
            <p>In the July 30, 1789 edition of <hi rend="italic">The <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Mercury, and Universal Advertiser</hi>, <name
                  type="pname">Bordley</name>'s second installment regarding the national coinage was published. This essay, "treatise on copper coin," has been
               quoted in several instances in Chapter 8. Although the presentation is unsigned, its context shows it to be definitely the work of <name
                  type="pname">Bordley</name>. Shortly afterward, the August 4, 1789 edition contained his next commentary on "weights," which was followed
               subsequently by the fourth sequel on "measures" on August 13.</p>
            <pb n="298"/>
            <p>These four contributions on silver coins, coppers, weights, and measures were revised and combined in a pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">on Monies,
                  Coins, Weights, and Measures, Proposed For the <name type="place">United States</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
               </hi>. This booklet was printed by <name type="pname">Daniel Humphreys</name>, the publisher of the newspaper in which the original presentations
               appeared. Only the year 1789 is noted on the title page of the pamphlet, but the revised style of the text and the appearance of an erratum in
               the October 20, 1789 edition of the paper, suggests it was printed early in October 1789.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to value more precisely foreign coins, <name type="pname">Bordley</name> updated his original monograph with <hi rend="italic">A
                  Supplement to the Essay on Monies, &amp;c.</hi> which occurred in two installments in <hi rend="italic">The <name type="place"
                     >Pennsylvania</name> Mercury</hi> on February 25 and 27, 1790. In the same fashion as the previous work, these two updates also appeared in
               leaflet form, but this time without revision.</p>
            <p>Other contributions by <name type="pname">Bordley</name> were printed during 1789 and 1790 in <name type="pname">Humphreys</name>' newspaper. On
               October 6, 1789, another letter on an agricultural subject discussed the relative merits of sheep production in <name type="place"
               >America</name>. Returning to coinage, a March 13, 1790 commentary was entitled "On the Moidore and the Par of Exchange with <name type="place"
                  >Portugal</name>." On a different subject, <name type="pname">Bordley</name> submitted his thoughts on "National Credit and Character" which
               were printed in the April 1, 1790 edition.</p>
            <p>While <name type="pname">Bordley</name> may be considered a visionary whose concepts on silver currency and the merits of decimalization never
               materialized, his comments on the copper medium, as presented in the "treatise on copper coin," have a very important place in the study of
               Confederation coinages. In this single, brief essay, he addressed many similar concerns which had been raised by other eighteenth century
               resources cited in this present book. His views on the base metal medium corroborate these collateral data and underscore the contemporaneous
               concerns regarding several aspects of copper currency such as low intrinsic value, the costs of manufacture, the consequences of oversupply, and
               the hazards of legal tender status. Because of the significance of <name type="pname">Bordley</name>'s work, his revised essay, "Copper Coins,"
               as it appeared in his pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">on Monies, Coins, Weights, and Measures, Proposed For the <name type="place">United
                     States</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>

               <q>A Treatise on copper coin, as far as I know, is a new thing. There are reasons why these coins ought to be limited in their power. If they
                  were to have the power to sink debts, as gold and silver have, they would be used vexatiously; and that would affect credits. Even if the
                  forcing them in payments should be confined to 5 per cent. of debts, or be at all allowed of, it would have that tendency: and a creditor
                  receiving a debt of 10,000 dollars, each cent thereof weighing 140 grains, at 5 per centum, would be burdened with 500 dollars worth, that is
                  50,000 pieces of copper of the weight of 1000 avoirdupois pounds; which selling as old copper, although it be at 20 cents a pound, would make
                  a loss of 20,000 cents on his whole claim; and moreover would burden him <pb n="299"/> with cartage, storage, and expenses of sales; so that
                  near 3 per cent. of his debt would be lost: which would affect commerce, especially with foreigners.<ref target="#APP5-n5">5</ref> An
                  ordinance of the late Congress, enacts that the treasury; and if I rightly understand it, the proprietors of bullion carried to the mint,
                  shall be paid 5 per cent. of their claims in copper cents. Ought those who carry bullion to the mint, to be burdened with inconvenience?</q>
               <q>It is said, the late Congress contracted for copper, to be coined at their mint and issued as above;<ref target="#APP5-n6">6</ref> and their
                  ordinance seems to intend that the public mint shall have the coining of copper cents. It is proper it should be so, exclusively. Having
                  found, from the report of a committee of the General Assembly of <name type="place">New-York</name>, in 1787,<ref target="#APP5-n7">7</ref>
                  that the best red copper in <hi rend="italic">sheets</hi> costs, at the factories in <name type="place">England</name>, 11d. sterling a pound;
                  on which they say the charges are 20 to 25 per cent. and that copper in mass, or old copper to be melted into ingots and drawn into sheets in
                  the plating mills costs 9d. sterling‚Äîcharges included, I thereon make an estimate of the cost of coining copper cents, of 50 to the pound of
                  copper, for a dollar worth 50d. sterling, thus: for a pound of copper, 24 cents;<ref target="#APP5-n8">8</ref> coining 12 cents;<ref
                     target="#APP5-n9">9</ref> together 36 cents, the cost. The pound of copper so coined passes for 50 cents.‚ÄîThe ordinance of the late
                  Congress says, 21/4 lbs. of copper shall be coined into 100 cents, (for a dollar of the value of 52d. 46/100 sterling value) at which rate
                  each cent weighs 1571/2 grains. The old English half-pennies, I suspect, weigh about 166 grains.<ref target="#APP5-n10">10</ref> I have one
                  which weighs 156 grains and appears to be true Tower coin, such as were not uncommon fifty years since; it is, however, so worn that the
                  impressions are nearly lost: it therefore may be presumed that it weighed 8 or 10 grains more when new: the Britannia side is quite smooth‚Äîthe
                  other side faintly shews the impression of a head or heads in the manner of a <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname"
                     >Mary</name> halfpence. The <name type="place">New-York</name> committee further report, that 48 genuine British halfpence, when <hi
                     rend="italic">new</hi>, weigh 1 lb, avoirdupois, each piece 146 grains: 60 <name type="place">Birmingham</name> coppers, are 1 lb. or
                  1161/2 grains each; and 46 4/10 genuine <name type="place">Jersey</name> coppers are 1 lb. or 151 grains, each.*</q>
               <q>The thought entertained by some of making the copper cent to be of intrinsic value, is alarming; as it threatens a design to enforce a base
                  and cumbersome metal in discharge of debts. The copper coin in that case must be 21/2 times as large as is proposed at present, or 350
                     grains.<ref target="#APP5-n11">11</ref> Why encrease an odium, or overbusily [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] adventure on a hazardous
                  innovation in a delicate affair?</q>
               <q>Copper coin, from the baseness of its metal, is not proper for a <hi rend="italic">money</hi> to be forced on creditors.<ref
                     target="#APP5-n12">12</ref> It is to be considered merely as a convenient substitute in the closing a payment, for want of silver coin
                  small enough for minute fractional purposes: as such it is <hi rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> received. Hucksters choose to receive it, as do
                  others, occasionally, in <pb n="300"/> small sums as is convenient to them. There would be no need of copper coins, were it not that cents and
                  pence would be in too small pieces, for preservation, when in silver; wherefore the base and bulky metal was introduced, merely for small
                  change. If, however, it shall be thought proper to give to copper any force,‚Äîwhich it is wished may be never attempted, it ought to be, if
                  possible, without injury or alarm to creditors. Forced payments in copper may in that case be limited to 5 or at most 9 cents on the close of
                     <hi rend="italic">full</hi> payments, large or small: on the payment of 10,000 dollars, no more to be forced on the creditor than in a case
                  of the least sum; because there is true and honest money in gold and silver of standard intrinsic value as low as ten or 5 cents, and the
                  coppers are no further useful than for closing the fractional balance.<ref target="#APP5-n13">13</ref> If the necessity of a copper coinage
                  can be avoided, it may be considered how far it would answer to coin cents in pieces of silver, whose periphery is enlarged by forming them
                  into a sort of rings with milled edges or coined surfaces: or rather the composition called billon may be coined, solid as are common copper
                  halfpence: it is more valuable than copper alone, being of copper and silver, yet bulky enough to be easily preserved. A billon-cent of a 50d.
                  dollar, half copper and half silver, which is the exact mint alloy for fine gold, would be near as large as a quarter of a Spanish dollar.
                  But, copper cents, the size, very nearly, of an English halfpenny, with its division into half pieces of 5 mills, are preferable to
                  billon-cents, and to small rings worth a cent each, as these would be too slender. The half cent in copper would be about the size of a
                  farthing English.</q>
               <q>On the whole of what I can collect concerning copper coins, it seems, they do not pass so much by virtue of their small intrinsic worth, as by
                  common consent, induced by a degree of necessity, merely as they are tokens for fractional sums which cannot be well issued in real money of
                  the precious metals.<ref target="#APP5-n14">14</ref> This inference is countenanced by the considerable deviation in their weights, when
                  issued even by the authority of nations tenacious of their character. English halfpennies of <hi rend="italic">pure</hi> copper have been
                  issued from the English mint of the contents of 156, if not 166, down to 146 grains, as they now are and have been for upwards of sixty years:
                  and <hi rend="italic">base</hi> copper issued by private coiners light as 116 grains, by consent, have passed currently as the best, to a vast
                  amount, and great loss of the community. The quality of metal appointed by public authority to be contained in <hi rend="italic">copper</hi>
                  coins, being a good deal arbitrary, the American States may have their cent coin, of fine copper, that shall nearly have the weight of a
                  British halfpenny: The British halfpenny weighs 146 grains of fine copper.</q>
               <q>Two pounds of copper will give 100 cents, each weighing 140 grains. The cents, for a device, may have a man, on one side of them, erect,
                  comfortably cloathed, and holding a spade in his hand: read,‚ÄîFro. Indust. Cents beco. Eag.‚ÄîOn the reverse, of this base coin‚Äîa coin that
                  cannot well be deemed <hi rend="italic">money</hi>, instead of the eagle let there be, on the margin of the cent, this reading:‚Äî"<name
