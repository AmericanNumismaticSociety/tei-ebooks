               <persName>Harrold E. Gillingham</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">Counterfeiting in Colonial <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>
               </hi> has been extremely helpful. It was the first book dealing with the problem of colonial counterfeiting but unfortunately made no use of unpublished court records and did not utilize other material, so that a new study of the subject has seemed warranted.</p>
            <p>Illustrations have been made available through the courtesy of <persName>Judge Oliver Schaeffer</persName> of the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName>Lancaster County</placeName> and <persName>Mr. James Brewster</persName>, State Librarian of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The chronological treatment of the subject is the same as that used by <persName>Gillingham</persName> and by the author in his <hi rend="italic">Counterfeiting in Colonial <placeName>New York</placeName>
               </hi>. In most instances the division into chapters is an arbitrary one.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">I THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The initial record of counterfeiting in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> is found in the Minutes of the Provincial Council for a session held in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> on the 8 mo. 24, 1683. <persName corresp="#viaf_24621346">Governor William Penn</persName> informed the board that it was convenient a warrant should be sent to arrest some persons on suspicion of passing bad money. Thereupon one <persName>Robert Fenton</persName> (or <persName>Felton</persName>), a servant, was brought in, sworn, and questioned. His answers were to the effect that he had received twenty-four pounds of "bard" silver from a certain <persName>Charles Pickering</persName> to coin for him. He also made the "seales" (dies), and <persName>Pickering</persName> and <persName>Samuel Buckley</persName> helped him to coin the bits. He was vague about the amount of copper alloy which was added to the silver, but stated that the silver brought him had already been alloyed and also admitted that <persName>Pickering</persName> and <persName>Buckley</persName> sometimes put in more copper than he knew of.</p>
            <p>On the warrant, which was promptly issued, <persName>Pickering</persName> and <persName>Buckley</persName> were brought before the council, whereupon the governor taxed them with their abuse to the government in coining "Spanish Bitts and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> money." They then readily confessed that they had put off new bits but claimed that all their money was as good silver as any Spanish coin. They also denied having had any hand in the coining, and <persName>Pickering</persName> declared that he had heard one <persName>John Rush</persName> swear that he spent half his time in making bits.</p>
            <p>At this the governor turned his attention to <persName>Buckley</persName>, who made a ready confession that he had taken part in melting money, adding copper alloy, and striking bits, all done together with <persName>Pickering</persName>'s servant, <persName>Robert Fenton</persName>. He also admitted that he had passed some of the bits.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>John Rush</persName>, whose name had been mentioned by <persName>Pickering</persName>, was next summoned and examined, but he denied everything that had been affirmed by <persName>Pickering</persName>. Then <persName>Buckley</persName> and a certain <persName>Thomas Philips</persName> provided security in the amount of five hundred pounds that

               <persName>Buckley</persName> would appear before the council when required and would not leave town without permission. <persName>Pickering</persName> and <persName>Richard Wall</persName>

                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> furnished bail in the same amount and under the same terms for <persName>Pickering</persName>. The sheriff was ordered to take <persName>Fenton</persName> into custody, and the same afternoon a warrant was issued to summon a grand and petit jury for the trial of <persName>Pickering</persName> and <persName>Buckley</persName>.</p>
            <p>The next day an indictment was ordered drawn up against these two men, and <persName>John Symcock</persName>, a member of the council, was sent to the Provincial Assembly to request that a certain <persName>Griffith Jones</persName> be permitted to come before the board to be examined on business of moment. Next, as complaint was made to the council about "New Bitts and <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> Shillings," it was decided that a proclamation should be issued forthwith to cry them down.</p>
            <p>When <persName>Griffith Jones</persName> arrived, he stated under oath that <persName>Pickering</persName> sent him eight pounds in "New Bitts" to pay <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> men, who, however, refused to accept the coin; at that he went to <persName>Mary Bartholomew</persName>, who changed forty shillings for him upon his promise to take them back again.</p>
            <p>The following day the Grand Jury found the bill against <persName>Charles Pickering</persName> "as being a Heynous and Grievous Crime." <persName>Pickering</persName> pleaded not guilty, whereupon <persName>Attorney General John White</persName> produced as witnesses <persName>Jones</persName> and <persName>Mary Bartholomew</persName>, who told the story related previously by <persName>Jones</persName>, while one <persName corresp="#viaf_41686930">Caleb Pusey</persName> also swore that <persName>Pickering</persName> paid him fifteen pounds in new bits, which were then produced in court. The foreman of the jury asked <persName>Pickering</persName> from whom he obtained the money which he had paid to several people, but the prisoner sought to avoid answering, replying that he would change the money that any person received of him and that no man should lose anything by him. The jury then retired and soon brought in a verdict of guilty as charged.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Buckley</persName> and <persName>Fenton</persName> were indicted and pleaded guilty, both con-

fessing that together with <persName>Pickering</persName> they had made the money. <persName>Fenton</persName> added that he had made the dies for <persName>Pickering</persName>, having worked a week or more on them and having finished one pair before he absented himself, while the other set was completed afterwards. Both <persName>Buckley</persName> and <persName>Fenton</persName> declared that their mint was not located in the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The governor now sentenced <persName>Charles Pickering</persName> for the high misdemeanor of which he had been found guilty: he was to make full satisfaction to every person who within a month should bring in "any of this false, Base and Counterfeit Coyne, (wch will by to morrow by Proclamation be called in,) according to their respective proportions, and that the money brought in, shall be melted into gross" before being returned to him; in addition <persName>Pickering</persName> was to pay a fine of forty pounds towards building a courthouse in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> and to find security for his good behavior.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Buckley</persName> was considered by the court to have been "more Engenious" than <persName>Pickering</persName> and was therefore fined only ten pounds to be used for a public courthouse and was required to provide satisfactory security for his "good abearance." <persName>Fenton</persName>, because he had frankly confessed and was a servant, was only sentenced to sit in the stocks for one hour the next morning.</p>
            <p>The day after sentence had been pronounced a proclamation was issued to put down the coins counterfeited by <persName>Pickering</persName> and to announce that he was to make satisfaction to all persons wronged by him.</p>
            <p>Some months later the sheriff brought before the council the grievance of the people concerning the new bits put out by <persName>Pickering</persName>. When <persName>Pickering</persName> was asked about the matter he replied that he would give money and plate to satisfy those who had complained. Thereupon the council ordered the sheriff to go to <persName>Pickering</persName> and receive the same amount of good money as he, the sheriff, had received bad money from the people. Then he was to pay out the good coin to the people who had surrendered to him the false bits.<ref target="#CH1-n2">

            <p>It is recorded that <persName>Pickering</persName>'s privileges of a freeman were restored in 1685 and that in 1690 he was elected to the Assembly. In his will, by which he left a fairly large estate and which was filed in 1749, he gave his trade as that of goldsmith.<ref target="#CH1-n3">

               <persName>Felton</persName>, or <persName>Fenton</persName> as he was called in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>, must have removed to that colony, where he had a shop, apparently for metal work. He was not, however, satisfied with legitimate profits, and on January 13, 1699, he was arrested and brought before <persName>William Pitkin</persName>, assistant. <persName>Pitkin</persName> examined him closely, asking him first if he had any false money, to which <persName>Fenton</persName> replied in the negative. When asked if he had any money, he admitted that he possessed one piece of eight, a half piece, two shillings and eight pence, all of which he showed, denying that he had any other coin. At this <persName>Pitkin</persName> had him searched by a constable, who found in one of <persName>Fenton</persName>'s pockets five pieces of eight, three half joes and one eight pence, all of which were judged to be false.<ref target="#CH1-n4">

            <p>
               <persName>Fenton</persName> then decided to make a clean breast of all he knew about the making of false Spanish and <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> money. His declaration before three assistants, <persName>William Pitkin</persName>, <persName>Samuel Willy</persName> and <persName>Caleb Stanly</persName>, and <persName>John Haynes</persName>, a justice of the peace, was as follows: in the summer of 1698 he had been employed by <persName>John Potterfield</persName> and the two men together had made about twenty pounds of bits out of pieces of eight (about one shilling's weight of alloy was put in each piece of eight and out of eight pieces of eight from fourteen to sixteen bits were struck) and likewise thirty or forty pieces of eight, each with two shillings' weight of alloy in it. <persName>Fenton</persName> received from <persName>Potterfield</persName> one pence for making each piece of eight and half the profit from the bits.<ref target="#CH1-n4a">

            </p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>Another person named by <persName>Fenton</persName> was <persName>John Tedman</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125123">Long Island</placeName>, who induced <persName>Fenton</persName> to make stamps and tools for coining pieces of eight, half pieces and bits, and together they struck some false money. <persName>Tedman</persName> paid him for his help with what he said was money of his own (<persName>Tedman</persName>'s) making, and <persName>Fenton</persName> found that it wanted about half the weight of good coin. Later on, in 1698, about six weeks before <persName>Fenton</persName>'s arrest, <persName>Tedman</persName> came to his shop and desired him to make stamps for dollars, which <persName>Fenton</persName> refused to do. <persName>Tedman</persName> said that he had one hundred and fifty pounds of Arabian metal to make up into money for a privateer about <placeName corresp="#geonames_5139054">Southold</placeName>. <persName>Fenton</persName> refused to help but did promise to call on him at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125123">Long Island</placeName> in April or May and to fetch over ore and coal from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Next <persName>Fenton</persName> mentioned <persName>John Hollam</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4843735">Stonington</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>, who, he said, met him at the smithy of <persName>James Dane</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4843735">Stonington</placeName> and spoke of ore and mines but he did not directly implicate <persName>Hollam</persName> in counterfeiting activities. Not so, however, in the case of a <persName>Mr. Hornbuckle</persName> of <placeName>Northampton</placeName>, who, according to <persName>Fenton</persName>, called on him in the spring of 1698, spoke of metals and showed him a piece of eight. When <persName>Fenton</persName> said he thought it a good one, <persName>Hornbuckle</persName> said there was no silver in it but that he had cast it from block tin and copper mixed. <persName>Hornbuckle</persName> explained how he had cast it and stated that he had put off a considerable number of such counterfeit pieces by himself or through his landlord and others.</p>
            <p>Finally <persName>Fenton</persName> confessed that he had made some stamps or tools for one Messenger, a "joyner" of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> ‚Äî he thought his name was <persName>Thomas</persName> ‚Äî where for about seven or eight years past he had kept his shop at the south corner of the "<placeName>Scoole Lane</placeName>."<ref target="#CH1-n5">

               <persName>Fenton</persName>'s examination was owned in court on May 18, 1699, but it is not recorded what punishment he received or whether others were then prosecuted. It was doubtless as a result of the <persName>Fenton</persName> affair that the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> General Assembly in May, 1699, passed legislation empowering
<pb n="6"/>
justices to bind over convicted coiners to good behavior or to commit such persons who could not find good surety to jail.<ref target="#CH1-n6">

            <p>Apparently the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> council was not convinced by the denial of <persName>John Rush</persName>, for shortly after the trials of the coiners were concluded "A Warrant Issued out to make search in ye Shop and Lodging of <persName>Isack ye Smith</persName>, <persName>Humphrey Best</persName> and <persName>Jno.

               </ref> There is no indication that the search led to the discovery of any incriminating evidence, which is not surprising, as <persName>Rush</persName> had had some five days in which to remove any evidence of coining. There can, however, be little doubt that he was a rascal and had very likely been engaged in counterfeiting as charged by <persName>Pickering</persName>. In 1687 his mother-in-law, <persName>Elizabeth Shorter</persName>, a widow, complained to the council that <persName>Rush</persName> "in stead of a Letter of Atturney that shee was to signe, prepared a Deed of gifft of all her Estate, with power of Atturney, to one <persName>Samll Atkins</persName>, to acknowledge the same in Court." The witnesses to the deed were examined and all confessed that the writing was not read to <persName>Widow Shorter</persName> and that she herself could neither read nor write, so that the document appeared to the council to be "an Absolute Cheat."<ref target="#CH1-n8">

            <p>During the winter of 1690/91 <persName>Cornelius Jacobs</persName>, master of a ship bound for <placeName corresp="#geonames_3489940">Jamaica</placeName>, discovered that a passenger, <persName>John Rush</persName>, was a false coiner and had ¬£9/15 in counterfeit money in a bag, "which he delivered to <persName>Jacobs</persName> heaving something over board in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3489940">Jamaica</placeName>." <persName>Rush</persName> was kept in prison in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3489940">Jamaica</placeName> during <persName>Jacobs</persName>' abode there but, since the crime had not been committed on that island, <persName>Jacobs</persName> brought back <persName>Rush</persName> as a prisoner to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName>. There <persName>Rush</persName> claimed that he had received the false coin from <persName>Edward Coffee</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>. The counterfeiting had probably been done in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, where <persName>Rush</persName> said that he had a family, so the Council of the Province of New

York wrote to the Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> that <persName>Rush</persName> was being sent under guard with a copy of <persName>Cornelius Jacobs</persName>' deposition in order that justice might take place and the truth be better discovered.<ref target="#CH1-n9">

            <p>The same day a warrant issued by the council instructed that <persName>Rush</persName> and his bag of false coin be conveyed from constable to constable to <placeName>Elizabethtown</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q845760">East Jersey</placeName>. It was requested that then the justices of the peace or some of them in that town have the prisoner conveyed to some justices in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q6273074">West Jersey</placeName>, who were asked to perform the like service until the prisoner and money were delivered to the governor or chief magistrate in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, there to be proceeded against according to law. The matter was thus submitted to the "prudence and discretion" of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> authorities.<ref target="#CH1-n10">

            <p>On the 3rd of 8 mo., 1689, one <persName>Thomas Lasy</persName>, previously a servant of <persName>Richard Few</persName>, deceased, was presented by the Grand Jury of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5184079">Chester County</placeName> "for Stamping and making Base and counterfeite peeces of Eight and Bartering and Exposing ye same for goods and other merchandize." <persName>Lasy</persName> confessed his guilt and was sentenced to stand at the public place of correction in Chester on two different court days for three hours each day.

            <p>In 1691 two cases of counterfeiting in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> are recorded.

               </ref> No trial or punishment is recorded, so there may have been no prosecution. In any event he was at large the next year and again in difficulties with the law, for in the summer of 1692 he was presented for ranging the woods and for taking up of horses saying he was a ranger "but" in the words of the indictment, "we find him not fitt for that honest Trust." He was also indicted at this time for taking "<persName>Jonathan Hays</persName> horse" and converting it to his own use. At the same session he was likewise presented, together with <persName>Owen Magdaniell</persName> and <persName>Daniell Ryley</persName>, "for riding &amp; ranging on first days as well as on other days &amp; for fireing a pistill Lat at night at <persName>John Calverts</persName> window to his and his wifes great afrightment," offenses which cost <persName>Thomson</persName> a fine of three pounds.<ref target="#CH1-n14">

            <p>The other counterfeiting case of 1691 was that of <persName>Charles Butler</persName>, indicted at the provincial court held on the "24th 7ber, 1691," in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, "for uttering &amp; paying away severall pieces of false monie, of false mixt mettall, to the Likeness of Spanish Coyn, called peices of eight, wch hee craftilie, falslie, deceitfullie, &amp; tratourouslie, to defraud the king &amp; his people, (wtout anie authority of Licence from the <persName>King</persName> &amp; Queen to him given,) Contrary to the Laws in such case made &amp; provided." The petit jury's written verdict, dated "<placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, the 26th of ye 7th mo., 1691," was: "Wee of the Jurie do find Charles
<pb n="9"/>
Butler guiltie of dispersing bad monie." <persName>David Lloyd</persName>, Clerk of the Court, according to a petition made by <persName>Butler</persName> in 1693, then made an addition to the verdict, whereby <persName>Butler</persName> had sentence pronounced against him for misprision of treason, "viz: That he shall forfeit his goods and chattells forever, and the profitts of his Land during his Life, and be Imprisioned during his Life." <persName>Butler</persName> maintained that the petit jury, hearing of and reproving <persName>Lloyd</persName>'s action, demanded their verdict and, with the consent of the bench, went forth and wrote their verdict again in the words they had formerly used. To <persName>Butler</persName>'s charge <persName>Lloyd</persName> made reply that he added nothing to the verdict and that what was added in the records was for form's sake, that it was made up after sentence had been passed, and that it therefore could not be the cause of the sentence.</p>
            <p>The council, after a full debate of the matter, found in <persName>Butler</persName>'s complaint matter of law against <persName>David Lloyd</persName> not cognizable by the lieutenant governor and council. Since, however, the sentence of misprision of treason seemed "verie severe agt ye petitiour, for being only found guilty of dispersing bad money," the council desired the governor, or, in his absence, the lieutenant governor, to grant <persName>Butler</persName> a pardon.<ref target="#CH1-n16">

            <p>In 1698 some of the small coin circulating in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> had been counterfeited, as is shown by the following petition to the general assembly, dated "<placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> the twenty first day of the third month" and signed by some fifty-three citizens.

            <p>A certain <persName>John Satell</persName> on February 3, 1702, was presented by the Grand Jury of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5205788">Philadelphia County</placeName> for having passed on January 2 counterfeit coin to <persName>Ann Simes</persName> at her husband's house in the city.

            <p>The next case of counterfeiting that has been recorded is more than a decade later. <persName>Mary Perkins</persName> on March 12, 1713, petitioned the Common Council of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> for the release of her husband, <persName>George</persName>, then in jail for counterfeiting, and for the return of his goods which had been seized.

            <p>A few years later two men were indicted by the Grand Inquest in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> for passing counterfeit coin: <persName>John Jay</persName>, a cordwainer, of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> was presented on October 31, 1717, for passing to <persName>Margaret Tench</persName> several false pieces of eight, while <persName>Rice Price</persName>, a slaughterer, also of the same city, was presented on June 30, 1718, for uttering to a certain <persName>Samuel King</persName> "for good and lawful money one Counter Made of Brass for the sum of Ten Shillings and Sixpence."<ref target="#CH2-n7">

            <p>At a Court of Oyer and Terminer for the City and County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, held on October 17‚Äì19, 1720, <persName>Edward Hunt</persName>, described as a "White-Smith," and his wife, <persName>Martha</persName>, were indicted, he for counterfeiting Spanish coin which was current in the colony, and she for passing the same, knowing it to be counterfeit. Both pleaded not guilty but, as the fact was fully proved upon them and the stamps and false coin were found in their possession, the jury brought them in guilty. Thereupon <persName>Chief Justice David Lloyd</persName> sentenced <persName>Edward Hunt</persName> to death and <persName>Martha</persName> to be fined five hundred pounds and to be imprisoned for life.<ref target="#CH2-n8">

            <p>On November 5 it was reported to the Provincial Council that <persName>Attorney General Andrew Hamilton</persName> had informed the lieutenant governor that <persName>Edward Hunt</persName>, convicted of high treason, lay in the jail of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> under sentence of death but that no execution had yet been awarded, in so far as he knew. One of the judges, who was present, informed the members of the council that, since the lieutenant governor had been absent, the judges had "delayed awarding the Execution" to give the criminal a reasonable time to appeal to the lieutenant governor. <persName>Lieutenant Governor William Keith</persName>, since only a few members of the council were in attendance,
<pb n="13"/>
proposed an adjournment to November 9 and that in the meantime a warrant issue.<ref target="#CH2-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The council convened on November 9, with <persName>Lieutenant Governor Keith</persName>, <persName>Richard Hill</persName>, <persName>Samuel Preston</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_18049442">Jonathan Dickinson</persName>, <persName>James Logan</persName>, the secretary, present. The <persName>Attorney General, Andrew Hamilton</persName>, also attended at the governor's desire, and Saturday, November 19, was appointed as the day for <persName>Hunt</persName>'s execution.<ref target="#CH2-n10">
                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> It was again urged by some of the members, according to the minutes,
<q>that <persName>Edward Hunts</persName> Crime (viz. High Treason for counterfeiting the current Coin,) being the first offence of that Nature, whereof any Person has been yet convicted in this Colony, it therefore seemed to claim some Compassion, but all agreed that there was nothing to be said in behalf of the Criminals former Character, personal merit or Behaviour. One of the Judges present seemed for the above Reason to incline that <persName>Hunt</persName> should be reprieved, until the <placeName>Kings</placeName> Pleasure could be known, but declared at the same time, that his Compassion for the Criminals circumstances did not proceed from any Ground of Dissatisfaction with any part of the Evidence upon the Tryal, which appeared to him sufficient to infer Conviction and the legal Sentence that had been pronounced. Those who spoke on the other side urged the nature of the Crime, and the Necessity that there was in all civil Governments to make some public Examples, the want of any merit in the Criminal, and the very little or no Service at all that a Reprieve to so miserable a Life could be to him.</q>
               <q>The members present being equally divided in their Opinions, it was left to the Governor to do therein as he thought fit.<ref target="#CH2-n11">

            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Lieutenant Governor Keith</persName>'s decision was to let the law take its course. <persName>Hunt</persName>, who had been captured in the Rebellion at <placeName>Preston</placeName> and transported as a bound servant to the Island of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3576395">Antigua</placeName>, made a dying speech at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> before his execution for the crime of high treason in counterfeiting Spanish silver coin which by Act of Parliament had been made current within all of the <persName>King</persName>'s colonies in <placeName>America</placeName>. In the speech he stated: "God knows I did not do it with
<pb n="14"/>
any Design to cheat or defraud any one, or to make a Practice of Coining; but being ignorant of the Breach of any Laws of God or Man, I thought I might cut those Impressions as innocently as any other, or the Stamps that the Gentlemen of this place imploy'd me about, to make Farthings." The condemned man, claiming to be "the first unhappy Instance of this kind that ever suffered in the <persName>King</persName>'s Dominions," expressed his forgiveness of <persName>John Moore</persName> and <persName>Morris Birchfield</persName> "and the Evidence that swore against me in that Tryal" and maintained his innocence "of anything laid to his charge by <persName>John Butler</persName>, either in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>."<ref target="#CH2-n12">

            </p>
            <p>An act of May 11, 1722, authorized the emission of ¬£15,000 in bills of credit and provided that

            <p>Somewhat more than a year later an act of December 12, 1723, for emitting ¬£30,000 in bills of credit made much the same provision against counterfeiters in the following terms:</p>
            <pb n="15"/>
            <q>And Be It Further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person or Persons whatsoever shall presume to forge or counterfeit, or be Aiding or Assisting in Forging or Counterfeiting any of the said Bills of Credit, or utter or cause to be uttered or offered in Payment, any Bill or Bills (knowing the same to be actually forged or counterfeited) with an Intent to defraud any other Persons, and be thereof legally convicted, he, she or they so offending shall be set upon the Pillory in some open publick Place, and there have both his or her Ears cut off, and he publickly whipp'd upon his or (her) bare Back with Thirty-one Lashes well laid on; and moreover shall forfeit the Sum of <hi rend="italic">One Hundred Pounds</hi>, current Money of <placeName>America</placeName>, to be levied of the Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels of such Offenders, the one Half thereof to the Use of the Government, and the other Half thereof to the Discoverer. And the Offender shall pay to the Party grieved double the Value of the Damage sustained by the said counterfeit Bills, together with the Costs and Charges of Prosecution. And in Case the Person or Persons so convicted have not sufficient to satisfy the Party for his or her Damages and Charges, and to pay the Forfeiture aforesaid, then and in such Case, the Offender or Offenders shall, by Order of the Court before which they were convicted, be sold for any Term, not exceeding Seven Years, for Satisfaction of the same. And in such Case the Trustees of the said Loan Office shall reward the Discoverer and Prosecutor of such insolvent Offenders to the Value of <hi rend="italic">Five Pounds</hi>.</q>
            <q>AND that all Magistrates and others, into whose Hands any counterfeited Bills may happen to come, shall forthwith deliver the same to one of the Trustees of the said Loan-Office, who shall cause the Names of those that delivered them, and of the Persons from whom they were taken, to be indorsed on the Back thereof; which Bills shall be safely kept in the said Office, and be forthcoming when there may be Occasion to make Use of the same.<ref target="#CH2-n14">

            </q>
            <p>Despite the provisions of these acts, the temptation soon proved too strong for counterfeiters, as is shown by the following notice which appeared in <hi rend="italic">The American Weekly Mercury</hi> of November 28, 1723: "Whereas several of our Bills of Credit have been of late found Counterfeited (that is the <hi rend="italic">One</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Two Shillings</hi> turned into <hi rend="italic">Ten</hi>) These are therefore to desire all Persons that receive any Bills to take

            <p>Within the next month or two a certain <persName>William Sinton</persName> was taken up and committed to the jail of <placeName>New Castle</placeName> for forging the paper currency.

<q>These are to give Notice, that there was stolen out of the Printing-House in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, 5 or 6 sheets of the 20s. and 5s.

He is a Tall Slender Lad, of a pale Complexion, about Eighteen Years of Age, he wears a light bobb Wigg, but it is uncertain what other Cloaths he has on.

sylvania twenty shilling bill. In accordance with the law of the province then in effect he was sentenced to be set on the pillory in the market place of the city; then he was to have both of his ears cut off, was to be given thirty-one lashes on the bare back, was to forfeit ¬£100 and was to pay double damages to the party grieved.<ref target="#CH2-n17">

            <p>At some time previous to February 6, 1727, one <persName>John Hawkins</persName> had been convicted at a Court of Record in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> of counterfeiting and uttering a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bill. It may be presumed that in accordance with the law he was set in the pillory, had both ears cropped, was given thirty-one lashes, was required to pay double damages to the person aggrieved and costs of prosecution and prison charges, as well as a fine of one hundred pounds. In any event, on that date, <persName>Hawkins</persName> petitioned the common council of the city to remit the fine of one hundred pounds, as he did not have the means to make satisfaction.

The jailer, however, did not release the two criminals because they had not the means to pay their court charges; <persName>Hawkins</persName> and <persName>Wolverston</persName> therefore again petitioned the council to order their release. The matter was taken up at a meeting on March 22, 1727, and the board decided that, since the Corporation had previously taken the prisoners' bonds with interest for their fines, the men should be now set free, as they were remaining in jail only on account of the fees and prison charges. The council further notified the sheriff that the prisoners had remained in jail at his cost ever since the date when their bonds were taken.<ref target="#CH2-n19">

            <p>It was only natural that the authorities were disturbed. <persName>Patrick Gordon</persName>, Lieutenant Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> and the Counties of <placeName>New Castle</placeName>, <placeName>Kent</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4144895">Sussex</placeName>, on March 30, 1727, addressed the speaker and members of the House of Representatives of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> in these terms:</p>
            <pb n="19"/>
            <q>The Weather and Floods having prevented Your meeting on the 27th Instant pursuant to Your last Adjourment, I thought it notwithstanding, as soon as a sufficient Number to make a House were in Town, to enable You, as I now do, to Act again: and altho' I understand you are still for the Reasons that have been mentioned, much short of being full, yet I cannot decline laying before you a Matter of vast Importance to the whole Country, which requires all our Attention, and your serious Application.</q>
            <q>This <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen</hi>, is the Horrid Attempt of some of the Wickedest of Men, to adulterate the Bills of Credit of our Own and the Neighbouring Provinces, first discovered by me at <placeName>New-Castle</placeName>, and since more fully by his Excellency the Governour of <hi rend="italic">New-York</hi>, who had advised me of his Success in Apprehending two of the Criminals there.</q>
            <q>The design appears to have been laid so deep, and to such an Extent, that it may not unjustly be compared to the Poisoning the Waters of a Country; the blackest, and most detestable Practice that is known, and which the Laws of Nations, and those of War condemn even in declared Enemies; for as that destroys the Lives of the innocent in taking their Natural Food, this would effectually overthrow all Credit, Commerce and Traffick, and the mutual Confidence that must subsist in Society, to enable the Members of it to procure to themselves and Families their necessary Bread.</q>
            <q>We have seen large Quantities of the <hi rend="italic">Counterfeit Bills</hi> of our Neighbouring Colony issued in this Province to the great loss of its Inhabitants, and I am credibly informed, the design has been laid to pour in upon us a Flood of our Own Bills Counterfeited from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, where they have so artfully imitated most of those of Jersey, that it requires more skill to distinguish them, than is to be expected amongst the common, and especially amongst Country People.</q>
            <q>Therefore to prevent the Importation, and spreading of these Bills, if possible, and to provide for the Apprehending and Punishing of the Importers, or Counterfeiters, and such as shall knowingly utter the same, in a manner more adequate to the Crime, than is yet provided by the Law, is what I must now earnestly recommend to your most serious Consideration, lest such Provision should be too late, and the Credit of our Bills should sink, which, for the fatal Consequences that you are sensible must attend that unhappy Event, should be guarded against with the utmost Care.<ref target="#CH2-n22">
                  <hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            </q>
            <pb n="20"/>
            <p>The next day <persName>David Lloyd</persName>, as speaker of the House of Representatives, made the following reply to the lieutenant governor's message:
<q>We have the pleasure to assure the Governour, that we so far agree with his Sentiments, as to Order a Bill to be prepared for making the detestable Crime of Falsifying or Counterfeiting our Bills of Credit more Penal than it was by the former Acts.</q>
               <q>And if the Governour pleases, since he is informed that some of the first Impression of our Bills are intended to be brought in Counterfeited from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, we now propose to call in the Remainder of those Bills to be Exchanged in the Loan-Office for others of the same Value, which we hope will be an Effectual Method to prevent Counterfeits, and support the solid and just Credit of our Paper-Currency.</q>
               <q>But that the People of this Province may not suffer by their Neighbourly good Will in giving a Voluntary Credit to the Paper Bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName>; We do earnestly request, That the Governour would be pleased to use his Interest and best Offices with the Governour and Assembly of that Province, to take some Effectual Care to prevent the pernicious Consequences of having their Bills of Credit Counterfeited and Uttered amongst us; and also in Case any Persons are apprehended in any part of this Government, for having Uttered Counterfeit or Falsify'd Bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName>, that the Governour would please to give Direction to the proper Officers to deliver over such Criminals into the Hands of the Magistracy of that Province, with such Evidence as can be found in Order to their being Punished according to Law.<ref target="#CH2-n23">

            <p>The lieutenant governor's action, combined doubtless with the interest of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> itself, resulted in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>'s striking new bills to exchange for those of the issue dated March 24, 1724, because they had been so widely counterfeited, and fixing the first Monday in November, 1728, as the day when the currency of the bills of March 24, 1724, was to end.<ref target="#CH2-n24">

               <persName corresp="#viaf_6469121">Lieutenant Governor Gordon</persName> had been correct in his fears of further counterfeiting in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>.

The mayor and magistrates at once ordered an investigation by the sheriff, who found in <persName>Eanon</persName>'s chest some 118 unsigned counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills of the new, current emission and deposited them with <persName>Mayor Thomas Lawrance</persName>. It was believed that a greater amount of these bills had gone to <placeName>Burlington</placeName> on the ship <hi rend="italic">Woodside Galley</hi>, on which <persName>Eanon</persName> had taken passage and shipped a quantity of goods but had been left behind himself.<ref target="#CH2-n26">

            <p>Further light was shed on <persName>Eanon</persName>'s doings and those of his associates in a dispatch dated "<placeName>Amboy</placeName>, September 23, 1729," which appeared in <hi rend="italic">The American Weekly Mercury</hi> of September 25. It was probably composed by a magistrate of <placeName>Amboy</placeName> and reads as follows:</p>
            <q>On Friday Night last, one <persName>William Scot</persName>, was Apprehended in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5096802">Woodbridge</placeName>, for Uttering one of our 18 Penny Bills, who on search, own'd he had Five more of the like Bills; he had a Parcel of Ribbons, and said he got them for some of the said Ribbons he sold on <hi rend="italic">Long-Island</hi>, but from whom he could not tell. The Justice there sent him to our Goal in this City, being betwixt 11 and 12, at which time I went to the Prison and had him strip'd, (the Justice of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5096802">Woodbridge</placeName>, having only searched his Pockets) and had a thoro' search, but could find no more Counterfeits, but found on his Examination, that there was great reason to suspect him; next Morning the Mayor and Aldermen, after some search, Examined him; on which we dispatch'd an Express to Acquaint his Excellency therewith, to know what Bills he had Passed on the Road; and to have his Chest searched, which we suspected was at his Lodgings in <placeName>New-York</placeName>. Our Governour gave Orders to search his Lodgings and other suspected Places, but <persName>John Thomson</persName> the Express we sent, Braced his Chest and Beding, to be put on board of the <persName>George</persName> and <hi rend="italic">

found sundry of our Counterfeit-Bills, pass'd in <hi rend="italic">New-York</hi>, and on the Road, by the said <persName>Scot</persName>.</q>
            <q>Yesterday the said <persName>Thomson</persName> returned, on which we went on board of the said Ship, and Demanded the said <persName>William Scot's</persName> Chest and Beding, which was Delivered by the Captain, and on search we found in a false Bottom of a small Trunk 476 Counterfeit Bills, Sign'd but not Numbered, and 106 Bills neither Sign'd nor Numbered; on which we went to the said <persName>Scot</persName> and acquainted him therewith, who on his Examination did depose, that this <persName>Adamson</persName> had carried one of the said Bills (he believed) from hence to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2964574">Dublin</placeName>, and that in Company with the said <persName>Adamson</persName> and <persName>Thomas Eanon</persName>, the said <persName>Adamson</persName> told them, that if they could get the like Printed, they would get Money enough by them, for that they Pass in those Parts as well as Gold or Silver, that the said <persName>Eanon</persName> agreed with the <persName>Printer</persName>, whose Name the said Deponent was sworn not to discover, that they paid their Proportions to <persName>Eanon</persName> for Printing, and that they divided the Bills betwixt them, but does not own what Number; he affirms they had not a Thousand each, that the said <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Eanon</persName>, <persName>Adamson</persName>
               </hi>, and himself, the said <persName>Scot</persName>, had all the Bills, and that there was no other concerned with them in that Affair. The Captain we had Examined, as well as all his Men, and his Ship searched, but they all deny that they knew any thing of the said <persName>Scot</persName>, or ever see him but at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4950065">Salem</placeName>, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New-England</placeName>, where the Ship Landed her Passengers, and the said <persName>Scot</persName> came first into those parts, and when he put those things on board in <hi rend="italic">New-York</hi>. As there is great reason to suspect, the Captain, he was committed likewise last Night to our Goal, but are in hopes to fix the Passing Part of the said <hi rend="italic">Bills</hi> on him.</q>

               <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of October 2, 1729, reported: "We hear from <placeName>Amboy</placeName>, that all the Persons concern'd with <persName>Eanon</persName> (the same that dy'd at Sea in his Passage from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2964574">Dublin</placeName> to this Place) in counterfeiting the 18d Bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, are apprehended and secur'd in their Prison.

And the Court gave Judgment against them, as followeth, viz.</q>
            <q>That you the said <persName>Adamson</persName>, be taken into a Cart at the Prison Door, on Friday the last Day of <hi rend="italic">October</hi>, and so Carted thro' the Streets of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5102578">Perth-Amboy</placeName>, with a Roap about your Neck; and that you be, about Eleven a-Clock in the Forenoon of the same Day put into the Pillory, and there to continue for an Hour, and from thence Carried with a Rope about your Neck to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5096802">Woodbridge</placeName>, to the Meeting-House of the said Town, thence to the Square before <persName>Mr. Herd's Door</persName>, and to stand in the Cart a quarter of an Hour: and that you have a Paper fixed on your Back and Breast, declaring your Offence, with one of the Counterfeit Bills fixed thereto; and from thence back to the Goal, there to remain until you pay the Fees and Charges.</q>
            <q>The same Sentence was pass'd on <persName>William Scott</persName>, with this Difference, he was to be Carted to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5102713">Piscataway</placeName>, and not to be inflicted on him until Saturday the Fifteenth of November.<ref target="#CH2-n27">

            <p>T<hi rend="italic">he <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of February 19, 1730, informed the public of a new attempt to forge the currency. The account read: "Last Week some counterfeit Five Shilling Bills of our Currency were passed here; but as they were clumsily done, upon mean Letter and ordinary Paper, and very unlike the Originals, they were soon discovered, and trac'd to One who was lately in Town from <placeName>New-Castle</placeName>. Orders are sent down to examine him about them. It is supposed they are come from the <hi rend="italic">old Quarter</hi>; tho' 'tis surprising that a Course of ill Success is not a sufficient Discouragement to such Practices."</p>
            <p>The results of the investigation that had been ordered are not known but on July 8, 1730, a counterfeiter of coin was taken up in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>. The most extensive account of the affair is the following:</p>
            <q>"Yesterday was apprehended one <hi rend="italic">Zachariah Field</hi> on suspicion of Counterfeiting the current Money, upon an Information from a Person in <placeName>New-Castle</placeName> to our Governor's Secretary, of his having uttered several pieces in his Progress from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>. He was search'd and there was found in his Pockets some Pistoles, Pieces of Eight and Dollars, and an unfinish'd piece, supposed a Pistole, not coloured like Gold, all Counterfeit. Upon his Examination before the honourable Mayor and Aldermen in Court he would make no Confession. A Person was dispatch'd to <placeName>Frankford</placeName>, where he had left his Horse, to search his Saddle Baggs, who found 101 Counterfeit Dollars. He is a <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New-England</placeName> Man by birth, Personable, Stout and very active in manly exercise, and very understanding in any Mettal Work."<ref target="#CH3-n1">

            <q>Another report of <persName>Field</persName>'s arrest states that he was pursued by a Hue and Cry from the Lower Counties and that the dollars in his portmantle were of "very ordinary workmanship."<ref target="#CH3-n2">

            <pb n="25"/>
            <p>In November he was tried on two indictments. In the first he was charged with high treason in counterfeiting the coin of another kingdom made current by an Act of Parliament in the British dominions, on which indictment he was acquitted. The other presentment was for misprision of treason, in counterfeiting the coin of another kingdom not made current by any Act of Parliament. On this indictment he was found guilty and was sentenced to forfeit the profits of all his lands during his life, to forfeit all his goods and chattels, and to be imprisoned during life.<ref target="#CH3-n3">

               <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of December 19, 1732, contained the following account of the counterfeiting of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> twenty shillings bills:
<q>Last Monday se'nnight in the Evening, three Men went into the Indian Prince Tavern, and having call'd for some Liquor, one of them offer'd a new Twenty Shilling Bill to be chang'd for the Reckoning. <persName>Mr. R. Brockden</persName>, Master of the House, suspecting it to be a Counterfeit, went with it immediately to <persName>A. Hamilton</persName>, Esq; (under Pretence of going out to get Change) who caused them presently to be apprehended. Upon Examination,
<pb n="26"/>
two of them appeared innocent, and were discharged; the third, who offer'd to pass the Bill, being ask'd how he came by it, answer'd that he brought Hogs to Town to sell, and had taken it of a Woman unknown in the Market: Upon searching him, two more of the same sort were found in his Pocket-book, all which he said he had taken for Pork. From the Indian Prince he was carried over to another Tavern, where he had put up his Horse, in order to see if he had any Bags wherein more Bills might be found. While the Examination was continuing there, a Woman Stranger in the outer Room was observed to appear somewhat concern'd; upon which she was call'd in, and ask'd, if she knew that Man: she answer'd Yes, he was her Brother; being ask'd if she had any Money about her, the Man was seen to wink at her, and she answer'd, No; but attempting to slide her hand into her Pocket, the(y) prevented her, and brought the Woman of the House to search her, who found in her Pocket twenty-three 20s. Bills of the same Sort. The Fellow finding the Story of the Hogs would not answer, nor any other Shuffles avail him any thing, betook himself at last to make an ingenuous Confession. He said that one <persName>Grindal</persName> who arrived this Summer in <persName>Capt. Blair</persName> from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, got 600 20s. Bills printed there from a Pattern he carried home last Year; that when he came here, he admitted one <persName>Watt</persName> into the Secret, and gave him a Number of the Bills to pass and exchange in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, while he went into the Jersies on the same Account, altering his Name to <persName>Thomson</persName> lest a wife he had married at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4559976">New-Garden</placeName> should hear of him; and that they were to meet next Christmass at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, and divide the Profits: That <persName>Watt</persName> had communicated the Thing to him, and given him Twenty-seven Bills to pass, of which he was to have a Share for himself; telling him to persuade him to it, that it was no Sin, for it would make Money plentier among poor People. He said he had as yet passed but one, of which the Change 19s. was found in his Pocket. He could not tell where <hi rend="italic">Grindel</hi> might be at this Time in the Jersies, but he inform'd that <persName>Watt</persName> was at <placeName>Eastown</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5184079">Chester County</placeName>. Officers were immediately dispatch'd in quest of him, who rid all Night, surpriz'd him in Bed about Day-break, and guarded him to Town. After Examination he was committed to Prison, to keep company with his Friend the Pork-seller, who it seems has <hi rend="italic">brought his Hogs to a fine Market</hi>. Tis hoped that by Christmass we shall see <persName>Grindal</persName> here also, that he may (according to Agreement) <hi rend="italic">share the Profits with 'em</hi>. The Bills they have attempted to counterfeit are of the last Impression; the Counterfeits might
<pb n="27"/>
pass with many People who do not take much Notice, but they have imitated the Paper very ill, that of the new Bills being thick and stiff, and the Counterfeits soft and flimsy. What is most surprizing is, that the Counterfeiters, with all their care and exactness, have entirely omitted numbering their Bills, at least none of those are number'd which are seiz'd. Was this Infatuation, or were they afraid they should not number them right?</q>
            </p>
            <p>A subsequent development of the affair is found in the same newspaper of January 11, 1753, which states: "Yesterday, being Market Day, <persName>Watt</persName> who was concern'd in the Counterfeit Money, as mentioned in one of our late Papers, receiv'd part of his Punishment, being whipt, pilloried and cropt. He behaved so as to touch the Compassion of the Mob, and they did not fling at him (as was expected) neither Snow-balls nor any Thing else; We hear that <persName>Grindal</persName>, the Importer of the Bills, and chief Person concern'd, was taken in the Jersies, but afterwards made his Escape. In his Pocket-Book was found the Account of Charge, so much to the Printer, so much for engraving the Plates, so much for Paper, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>There is no reference to the "Pork-seller," so it may be assumed that he turned <persName>King</persName>'s Evidence in the trial of <persName>Joseph Watt</persName>. <persName>Watt</persName>, however, after standing in the pillory and having his ears cropped, was confined in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> jail, from which he broke out and escaped on the night of June 13, 1733. He was described in an advertisement as "about Forty Years of Age, with long, strait brown Hair, and has a Scar in his Throat where he attempted to cut it." Anyone who might take him or who could give intelligence of him was requested to notify the sheriff.<ref target="#CH3-n6">

            </p>
            <p>At the Court of Quarter Sessions for <placeName corresp="#geonames_5197085">Lancaster County</placeName> held at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5197079">Lancaster</placeName> on May 1, 1733, three men were indicted for passing false coin in the likeness of silver money current in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>. Two of them may have been brothers or relatives, for they were named <persName>Robert</persName> and <persName>James Black</persName>. <persName>Robert</persName> was charged with uttering four counterfeit dollars, pleaded not guilty, but was tried and convicted.
<pb n="28"/>
He was sentenced to be whipped twenty lashes at the common whipping post, to stand in the pillory one hour and there have both ears cut off, and to pay the costs of prosecution. <persName>James Black</persName> was presented for passing two false "Lyon Dollars." He pleaded not guilty, and the jury found him not guilty "in manner and form as by the said Indictm<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. is supposed." The third suspected counterfeiter was <persName>Cornelius Walraven</persName>, charged with passing seven false dollars. He was convicted and received the same sentence as <persName>Robert Black</persName>, save that he was to be given thirty-one (instead of twenty) lashes, perhaps because he had passed more dollars than <persName>Black</persName> had.<ref target="#CH3-n7">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>On August 5, 1734, <persName>A. Hamilton</persName> prepared an advertisement which was published three days later in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi>. Its text was as follows: "There being lately discovered a counterfeit Twenty Shilling Bill, of the likeness of the Bills of Credit of the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> of the same Denomination, Dated the Tenth Day of April, 1731. All Persons are desired to be careful lest they be imposed upon by the said false Bills. They are to be known only by the Difference in the Signers Names, the Paper of the false Bills is thinner, and the Ink with which they are printed, is paler than in the true Bills."</p>
            <p>It appears that some confederates were engaged in passing not only <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> but also <placeName>New Castle</placeName> bills. On November 20 several counterfeit twenty shilling <placeName>New Castle</placeName> bills were discovered which had been passed at the fair. Some persons recalled the man who had paid out the money to them, and the utterer was at once pursued and arrested at Chester. He was brought to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, where he was examined, made an ample confession and discovered his associates. It was reported that ¬£5,000 of the false paper money had been imported. The most obvious marks for detecting the counterfeits were the following: in the false bills the word "Indented" in the first line stood too high in the line; towards the bottom the words "of this" were placed too close together, thus "ofthis," and all the lines were more uneven than in the true bills.<ref target="#CH3-n8">

            </p>
            <pb n="29"/>
            <p>On November 28 an item appeared in the press to the effect that, since the apprehension of the passer of forged <placeName>New Castle</placeName> money, two more persons, the importer and the signer, concerned in the affair had been seized in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> and imprisoned in <placeName>New Castle</placeName>. It was said that the greatest part of the bills brought over were found with them.<ref target="#CH3-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref> A week later, however, a correction was printed in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi>, which informed its readers that the two men taken in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> were not in jail in <placeName>New Castle</placeName> but in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4950065">Salem</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, where they had been admitted to bail, and that their names were <persName>Conway</persName> and <persName>Sherwin</persName>. Their false bills, <placeName>New Castle</placeName> twenty shilling and ten shilling notes, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> twenty shilling and fifteen shilling bills, were found hidden on an island in the middle of a great marsh. Although these men had, according to report, passed almost seven hundred pounds of counterfeits, it was claimed that but few of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills had been uttered. The false ten shilling <placeName>New Castle</placeName> notes could, in general, be recognized by the paleness of the print and by the fact that in the TEN SHILLINGS in the body of the bill the first S of SHILLINGS stood much too low in the line, thus <hi rend="sub">s</hi>HILLINGS. The forged twenty shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills could be known by the fact that the G in the word SHILLINGS at the top of the bill was too high for the rest of the letters, thus TWENTY SHILLIN<hi rend="sup">G</hi>S.</p>
            <p>On January 9, 1735, the public was informed by the same newspaper that, since the publication of the above notice concerning forged twenty and ten shilling bills, also one or two fifteen shilling bills of <placeName>New Castle</placeName> currency, which were counterfeit and which seemed to be done with a plate, had been passed. They were supposed to belong to a new parcel and the marks by which they might be known were the following: "In the second Line in the Words (Fifteen Shillings) the Capital F at the Beginning of <hi rend="italic">Fifteen</hi> is much shorter and less than the S at the beginning of <hi rend="italic">Shillings</hi>, but in the true Bills they are of equal Heighth: And in the fifth Line, in the Words (<placeName>New-Castle</placeName>, <placeName>Kent</placeName>,) the C and K beginning (<placeName>Castle</placeName>) and (<placeName>Kent</placeName>) are much
<pb n="30"/>
too big in Proportion to the (N) at the beginning of (New) and the small Letters in all the Words mentioned stand at too great a Distance from another thus,
<q>Fifteen Shillings, <placeName>New-Castle</placeName>, <placeName>Kent</placeName>,</q>
the whole is done with Ink much paler than that of the true Bills."</p>
            <p>It has been incorrectly stated that the men responsible for the false <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName>Newcastle</placeName> bills, <persName>Conway</persName> and <persName>Sherwin</persName>, were "let out on bail and finally escaped."<ref target="#CH3-n10">
                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> Such was not, however, the case, for <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of February 25, 1735, carried this item: "We hear from <placeName>New-Castle</placeName>, that <persName>Conway</persName> and <persName>Sherwin</persName>, the two Counterfeiters of Bills, were tryed last Week; the former pleaded guilty, and the latter was found guilty; and both received Sentence according to Law." The same newspaper on March 27, 1735, noted the infliction of the penalty in these words: "We hear from <placeName>New-Castle</placeName>, that on Thursday last, the 2 Counterfeiters of Paper Money, who have been some time under Sentence in the Goal there, suffered the Punishment of Whipping, Pillory, and Loss of Ears, according to Law. They are also fined an Hundred Pounds, and to pay double the Value of the Damage occasioned by the Counterfeit Bills."</p>
            <p>On September 15, <persName corresp="#viaf_64880102">Israel Pemberton</persName>, <persName>Thomas Leech</persName> and <persName>Joseph Harvey</persName>, three of the trustees of the Loan Office, reported that pursuant to an order of the Assembly of March 19, 1735, they had burnt and destroyed the counterfeit bills, amounting in the whole to ¬£1668/15/‚Äî, which had all been imported from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> by <persName>Robert Conway</persName> and his associates. The false money consisted of 987 bills of 20 shillings, not signed, and 37 of the same which were signed; 853 false bills of 15 shillings, not signed, all these in imitation of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> money; finally 5 counterfeit 20 shilling bills in imitation of <placeName>New Castle</placeName> currency.<ref target="#CH3-n11">

            <p>At this time, as indeed throughout the Colonial Period, bills of credit were being counterfeited in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName>, and especially in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>,
<pb n="31"/>
and were then being imported into the provinces in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255149">North America</placeName>. A dispatch from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> dated May 3, 1736, was printed three days later in <hi rend="italic">The American Weekly Mercury</hi> to the effect that a few days before an Irishman had been seen in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> with a quantity of <placeName>New Castle</placeName> bills of the denominations of eighteen pence and of twenty shillings. These were quite new and the signers' hands were rather well imitated but the engraving part differed from that on the true bills of the same denominations.</p>
            <p>Somewhat more than a year later another Irish counterfeiter was described by the same newspaper of June 16, 1737. The account read:
<q>On the 12th Instant was apprehended here (in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>), an Irishman, who was just come to this City from <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New-England</placeName>, where he says he arrived from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> in <hi rend="italic">August</hi> last. and there were found upon him Eight counterfeit Bills, made in Imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Five Shilling</hi> Bills of Credit of the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, printed in the Year 1729, and Signed with the Names of <hi rend="italic">

            <p>From the Minutes of the Provincial Council it is revealed that the Irishman was <persName>William Neal</persName> and that in his examination in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> he declared that he had received the false bills from one <persName>Benjamin Ellard</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839416">New London</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>. The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> authorities applied to the magistrates in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839416">New London</placeName>, who arrested and questioned <persName>Ellard</persName>. He "frankly and without hesitation" admitted that he paid out the bills as genuine to <persName>Neal</persName> and also affirmed that he had, in the presence of a certain <persName>Thomas Davis</persName>, received the bills from one <persName>Rowland Houghton</persName>, a merchant of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName>. The depositions of both <persName>Ellard</persName> and <persName>Davis</persName> were sent to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, and the magistrates of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839416">New London</placeName> expressed the opinion that <persName>Ellard</persName> was entirely innocent of the fraud, adding "that this <persName>Houghton</persName> is the same person who made the plates by which a late paper Currency at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> was struck." Upon consideration of these documents the council dispatched, on July 14, 1737, a letter addressed to <persName corresp="#viaf_62352405">Governor Jonathan Belcher</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>, to whom the council wrote that it was applying "in a Matter that not only nearly concerns this Government, but in its Consequences may affect others on the Continent with whom we have any Dealings or Intercourse." The letter told of the arrest of <persName>Neal</persName> and of the information secured from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839416">New London</placeName> about <persName>Ellard</persName> and his claim that he obtained the bills the previous August from <persName>Rowland Houghton</persName>.

<q>Whereas Information hath been given to the Trustees of the General Loan Office, of the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>; That a considerable Number of Counterfeit Bills, made in Imitation of the Bills of Credit of the said Province of the Denomination of Five Shillings, dated in the Year 1729, and Signed <persName>ABRAHAM CHAPMAN</persName>, <persName>JOHN PARRY</persName> and <persName>EDWARD HORNE</persName>; have been uttered and past as genuine and true Bills, as well in the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName> as in this Province; and being further inform'd that an Irish Man, pretending to be a Pedlar, hath uttered several of the said Bills about <placeName corresp="#geonames_5097068">Crosswicks</placeName> in <placeName>Burlington</placeName> County, in Payment for Buckskins and other Things: These are to request all Magistrates and others His Majesty's liege Subjects, to be aiding and assisting in the apprehending the Person or Persons who have uttered the said Counterfeit Bills.</q>

            <p>The assembly was as good as its word. Heretofore the counterfeiting or passing of bills of credit of the province had been punishable by the pillory, the lash, cropping, and fines. Now, on May 19, 1739, an act was passed for reprinting, exchanging, and re-emitting all the bills of credit of the province and for striking ¬£11,110 and five shillings, to be emitted upon loan. In this law it was provided:
<q>‚Ä¶if any Person or Persons shall presume to counterfeit any of the said Bills of Credit, made current by this Act, or any Law of this Province, by printing or procuring the same to be printed or otherwise counterfeited in the Likeness of the said genuine Bills of Credit; and also if any Person or Persons shall forge the Name or Names of the Signers of the true Bills of Credit, to such Counterfeit Bills, whether the counterfeiting of the said Bills or Names be done within this Province or elsewhere, or shall utter such Bills, knowing them to be counterfeited as aforesaid, and being thereof legally convicted, by Confession, standing mute, or by the Verdict of Twelve Men, in any Court of Record within this Province, he, she or they shall suffer Death without Benefit of the Clergy: And the Discoverer or Informer shall have, as an Incouragement for his Discovery, the Sum of <hi rend="italic">Fifty Pounds</hi>, out of the Goods and Chattels, Lands and Tenements of the Person convicted, and if no such Goods and Chattels can be found, then the Trustees of the General Loan Office shall pay to such Informer or Discoverer, his Executors, Administrators or Assigns, the Sum of <hi rend="italic">Ten</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pounds</hi>. And if any Person or Persons, shall counterfeit any of the said Bills of Credit of this Province by altering the Denomination of the said Bills, with Design to increase the Value of such Bills, or shall utter such Bills, knowing them to be counterfeited or altered as aforesaid, and shall thereof be legally convicted, in any Court of Record of this Province, such Person or Persons shall be sentenced to the Pillory, and to have both his or her Ears cut off and nailed to the Pillory, and to be publickly whipt on his or her bare Back, with <hi rend="italic">Thirty-one</hi> Lashes well laid on: And moreover, every such Offender shall forfeit the Sum of <hi rend="italic">One Hundred Pounds</hi> lawful Money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, to be levied on his and her Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels, the one half to the Use of the Governor, and the other half to the Discoverer: and the Offender shall pay to the Party grieved double the Value of the Damages thereby sustained, together with the Costs and Charges of Prosecution. And in Case the Offender hath not sufficient to Satisfy the Discoverer for his or her Damages and Charges, and pay the Forfeiture aforesaid, in such Case the Offender shall, by Order of the Court where he or she was convicted, be sold, for any Term not exceeding Seven Years, for Satisfaction: and in such Case the said Trustees shall reward the Discoverer of such insolvent Offender, to the Value of <hi rend="italic">Five Pounds</hi>. And every such Counterfeit Bill shall be delivered to any of the said Trustees, to be made Use of upon the Tryal of the Person accused or suspected, and afterwards to be burnt or destroyed by the said Trustees, in the Presence of a Committee of Assembly.<ref target="#CH3-n18">

            <p>The immediate cause of this drastic legislation against counterfeiting or altering the bills of credit was doubtless the case of one <persName>William Bodie</persName>, which is referred to in these terms in the Minutes of the Provincial Council at a meeting held on January 18, 1738:
<q>The President (<persName>James Logan</persName>) acquainted the Board that this morning he received a letter from <persName>Mr. Hamilton</persName>, one of the Trustees of the General Loan Office of this Province, giving an Account that a Discovery had been made of some of the Bills counterfeited in imitation of the Bills of Credit of this Government, a parcel of which counterfeits unsigned the President

laid before the Board, &amp; informed them that one <persName>Robert Savory</persName> had voluntarily made this Discovery, who being acquainted at <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> with one <persName>William Bodie</persName>, a Person of a dishonest Character, who had lived in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5182201">Bucks County</placeName>, in this Province, was by his means made privy to the Design, that <persName>Savory</persName> was now attending, in order to declare his knowledge of the whole before the Board, &amp; he being called in &amp; examined, gave a Narrative of the Matter, which the Board judging proper to be taken on Oath, &amp; that he should be more particularly examined touching other Circumstances, Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
                  <persName>Plumstead</persName> &amp; <persName>Laurence</persName> are appointed a Committee for that Purpose, &amp; to report the said Examination to the Board at their next meeting; And the Board being also of Opinion that a diligent Enquiry should be forthwith made for <persName>Bodie</persName>, who, if returned from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2648147">Britain</placeName>, may probably be found near the Place of his former Residence, It is Ordered that a proper Person be dispatched by the President into the County of Bucks for this End.<ref target="#CH3-n19">

               <q>The Examinant saith, that for some years he served <persName>William Franklyn</persName>, of <placeName>Bednall Green</placeName>, Brewer, whose Son <persName>William</persName>, returning from <placeName>America</placeName>, brought the Examinant acquainted, about September, one thousand seven hundred &amp; thirty-six, with one <persName>William Bodie</persName>, who had come Passenger from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> in the same Ship with the said <persName>William Franklyn</persName>, the younger; that the Examinant &amp; the said <persName>Bodie</persName> becoming intimate, &amp; often meeting together at one <persName>John Parker</persName>'s, who keeps a publick House in <placeName>Spittlefields</placeName>, <persName>Bodie</persName> told the Examinant that he, said <persName>Bodie</persName>, had lived in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, in <placeName>America</placeName>, where there were Paper Bills current, equal almost to Sterling

money; that he had received Orders from the Proprietors of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> to gett some Paper Money Bills printed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName>, &amp; shewed the Examinant two he had brought for Patterns, the one being a half Crown Bill of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Currency, &amp; the other a Crown Bill of the Counties on <placeName corresp="#geonames_4142224">Delaware</placeName>, on which last there was an Escutcheon, bearing the British Arms, with the Word <placeName corresp="#geonames_4142224">Delaware</placeName>. That the said <persName>John Parker</persName> desired the Examinant to assist the said <persName>Bodie</persName> in showing him the Town, to witt, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName>, &amp; where he might find proper Persons to cutt the Plates, and to print the Bills alike to those which he had brought over; that accordingly this Examinant went to several Places with the said <persName>Bodie</persName>, particularly to one <persName>William Pennock</persName>, a Wood Cutter, in <placeName>Jewin Street</placeName>, near Aldersgate Street, who undertook to cutt wooden Dyes for the half Crown Bills; and then they went to one [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] <persName>Halfhide</persName>, an Engraver, in the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q6869220">Minories</placeName>, who undertook to cutt a Plate for the Crown Bills; That the Examinant &amp; <persName>Bodie</persName> becoming more closely intimate, discoursing freely together, <persName>Bodie</persName> told the Examinant about Christmas, One thousand seven hundred &amp; thirty-six, that the Bills which were to be printed off were not for the Proprietors of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, as he, the said <persName>Bodie</persName>, had given out, but were truly for himself and his own private benefit; that if they could be printed off exactly alike with those he had brought over, which were Current in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, he could easily gett the Names signed by some in <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> who could do them extraordinary well, and thus the Bills would be equal to so much Money, &amp; offered to the Examinant to lett him in for a share of the advantage, as he had been at some Trouble in assisting him, the said <persName>Bodie</persName>; The Examinant acknowledges that this Prospect of Gain, without considering the Hazard that attended it, induced him to become serviceable and assisting to the said Bodie, who having afterwards got the wooden Dyes from <persName>Pennock</persName>, a Number of half Crown Bills were printed off by a Printer in Aldersgate street, whose name the Examinant does not remember, to the value of Seven hundred pounds, as <persName>Bodie</persName> told the Examinant, but <persName>Halfhide</persName>, the engraver, refusing to lett <persName>Bodie</persName> have the Plate for the Crown Bills, unless he would give Security to keep the said <persName>Halfhide</persName> harmless, in case any undue Use should be made of it, no Crown Bills were printed off, as far as this Examinant knows; That the Examinant &amp; <persName>Bodie</persName> sett out from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> for <placeName corresp="#geonames_2654675">Bristol</placeName> with the Bills aforesaid, in order to take Shipping from thence for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>; when the Deponent beginning to consider the Affair he was going about, grew uneasy in the
<pb n="38"/>
Mind, and revealed the whole matter to one <persName>Joseph Allen</persName>, a person employed in the Service of the East India Company, who was then at <placeName corresp="#geonames_2654675">Bristol</placeName>, &amp; with whom the Examinant was acquainted, whereupon, the said <persName>Allen</persName> diswaded the Examinant from prosecuting the design, representing it as highly dangerous, &amp; what might possibly bring the Examinant to a Rope. The Examinant, upon this Advice from his Friend, determined to have nothing further to do with <persName>Bodie</persName>; but the Examinant having thrown himself out of Business, &amp; sold off great Part of what he had in the World, was ashamed to return to the place of his former Habitation, &amp; therefore determined to come into <placeName>America</placeName> &amp; seek his Living there; that upon imparting this Resolution of his to <persName>Bodie</persName>, he appeared much surprized &amp; alarmed, &amp; used Endeavours with the Exam<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. to confirm him in the Prosecution of their first Design; but the Examinant being sensible of the Danger, persist'd in the Resolution of leaving <persName>Bodie</persName>, who then pressed the Examinant to take a Share of the Bills, which the Exam<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. refused, saying they could be of no Service to him; but Bodie's telling the Examinant they would pay his Passage, gave him a Bundle of them in a Handkerchief, which the Examinant took, not intending to make any other Use of them than to discover <persName>Bodie</persName>'s Design, who had by means of it brought the Examinant into great Trouble and Sorrow; That <persName>Bodie</persName> told the Examinant if he came to <placeName>America</placeName> he might hear of him, the said <persName>Bodie</persName>, near to Dobb's ferry, about thirty Miles from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName>, at one <persName>Houston</persName>'s, whose Daughter the said <persName>Bodie</persName> had Married. And the Examinant further saith, that leaving the said <persName>Bodie</persName> at <placeName corresp="#geonames_2654675">Bristol</placeName>, the Examinant took a Passage on board the <persName>Billinder Hawkins</persName>, <persName>John Cole</persName>, Master, for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4597040">South Carolina</placeName>, &amp; arriving in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4574324">Charlestown</placeName> the Examinant was soon taken ill, &amp; being attended in his Sickness by one <persName>Doctor Killpatrick</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4574324">Charlestown</placeName> aforesaid, the Examinant acquainted him with the whole Affair as above narrated, &amp; showed some of the Bills to him, giving him one of them &amp; desiring he would send it to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, which the said <persName>Doctor Killpatrick</persName> promised he would; That the Examinant recovering from his Indisposition, resolved to travel to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> in order to make a Discovery of the whole Affair as far as he knew of it; and having left his Chest, wherein several of the said unsigned Bills are, in the Custody of one <persName>Thomas Lamson</persName>, a Tavern keeper in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4574324">Charlestown</placeName>, the Examinant brought a parcell of them hither, which he hath delivered up to <persName>Andrew Hamilton</persName>, Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>., one of the Trustees of the General Loan Office of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and declares that he hath faithfully

            <p>The Minutes of this session of the Council continue with the following lines about the same affair:
<q>The Board were likewise informed, that the Express dispatched into <placeName corresp="#geonames_5182201">Bucks County</placeName> to enquire about <persName>William Bodie</persName>, being returned, brought an Account that he was not to be found, but that <persName>Mr. Langhorne</persName> had undertaken to use all possible Endeavours for discovering &amp; apprehending him. Upon considering the whole of this matter, the Board are of Opinion that a Copy of the foregoing Examination should be sent by the first Opportunity to the Governor or Commander-in-Chief, for the time being, of the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4597040">South Carolina</placeName>, &amp; that he should be requested to order <persName>Savory</persName>'s Chest to be carefully searched, &amp; the counterfeited Bills to be secured &amp; transmitted hither, and to cause <persName>Lamson</persName>, in whose Custody the said Chest was left, to be examined touching his Knowledge of the said <persName>Savory</persName> and of the counterfeited Bills; &amp; further, that an Enquiry should be made of <persName>Doctor Killpatrick</persName> touching the truth of the Circumstance wherein that Gentleman's Name is mentioned by <persName>Savory</persName>, that it may be known how far the Discovery made by him is true &amp; genuine in its several Parts. And It is recommended to the President to write to the said Governor or Commander-in-Chief accordingly.<ref target="#CH3-n21">

            <p>During the year 1738 three other persons were charged with counterfeiting. Of these <persName>John Herd</persName> was indicted at the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5197085">Lancaster County</placeName>, held on May 2, for passing to one <persName corresp="#viaf_14852156">James Burk</persName> a piece of brass as a true piece of gold, of the value of seven shillings and sixpence lawful money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>. <persName>Herd</persName> pleaded not guilty, was tried and acquitted.<ref target="#CH3-n22">

            <p>Later, on October 30, the Grand Jury of the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> indicted <persName>Thomas Carr</persName>, a laborer of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, for having uttered, knowing it to be false, a counterfeit ten shilling bill of <placeName>New Castle</placeName>, <placeName>Kent</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4144895">Sussex</placeName>, to which presentment <persName>Carr</persName> pleaded not guilty.<ref target="#CH3-n23">

            <p>Three days later <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> carried an account of the apprehension of another passer of false bills of the Lower Counties on <placeName corresp="#geonames_4142224">Delaware</placeName>. It read:
<q>One <persName>Whitesides</persName>, who lately came from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> in <persName>Capt. Grieves</persName>, is apprehended and imprisoned at <placeName>New-Castle</placeName>, for uttering Counterfeit <hi rend="italic">Twenty Shilling</hi> Bills of that Government. 1029 of the Bills were found in his Custody. And as it is not known what Quantity may have been dispers'd, we think proper to give our Readers such Marks to distinguish by, as may secure them from being impos'd on, viz.</q>
               <q>In the Counterfeit Bills the Words, and Sussex, stand thus, (and Sussex), Sussex being considerably lower than <hi rend="italic">and</hi>. In the true Bills those words stand pretty even upon a Line.</q>
               <q>In the Counterfeits, in the Word <hi rend="italic">Payments</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> seems to lean backwards, thus <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, in the true ones it leans forwards.</q>
               <q>In the Counterfeits, in the last two Lines, the f of the Word (of) stands right over the (n) in the Word (upon) thus, (of upon) In the true Bills the same f stands right over the (o) of the same Word (upon) thus (of upon)</q>
               <q>There is in both the True and Counterfeit Bills a Row of 10 Flour-deluces, among the Signers Names; in the Counterfeit Bills they all stand even on a Line. In the true Bills, the 6th and 9th stand a little below the rest, thus, <graphic url="NNM132_053.jpg"/> ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì The Bills are dated 1734.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Although the court records for this period have not survived and the newspapers shed no further light on the case, it is stated in the minutes of the House of Assembly of the Three Lower Counties that <persName>Whitesides</persName> was convicted. His fine was ¬£100, and on April 19, 1739, a lively debate arose in the house concerning the disposition of half of this sum. A law had been passed to grant one half of the fine to the informer and the other half to the government, and the question now was whether the governor was to obtain ¬£50 of the fine imposed on
<pb n="41"/>
               <persName>Whitesides</persName>. After the opinions of the attorneys general of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> and the Three Lower Counties had been presented, the assembly voted that the sum belonged to the people and not to the governor. It was revealed that the law required that any person convicted of forging the bills of credit of the counties should be set in the pillory and fined ¬£100, so it may be assumed that <persName>Whitesides</persName> also stood in the pillory, probably for the space of one hour.<ref target="#CH3-n24">

            <p>At the close of 1739 a plan was put into effect to secure counterfeits in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> of various Colonial bills.

            <p>The printer was apparently interested and consented to undertake the work but by the time a week had passed he seems to have gotten cold feet. His subsequent move is told in a letter composed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> on March 10, 1740, by the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Agent, <persName>Frederick John Paris</persName>, and sent to <persName>Governor George Thomas</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>. <persName>Paris</persName> wrote:
<q>And <persName>Ilive</persName>, the Printer, was promist mighty Rewards, if he woud be faithful to his Trust, &amp; carry on this Affair from time to time.</q>
               <q>I doubt <persName>Ilive</persName> himself is but half honest, he was rather fearful of coming into Trouble, &amp; desirous of getting some Reward, than merely of discovering such a Base Design out of a true hatred to it.</q>
               <q>But, however that was, about the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi> last, <persName>Ilive</persName> carryed the Papers, &amp; made an Inform<hi rend="sup">n</hi> to the Under Secretarys of State, Therein (by Mistake) calling the Bills <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> &amp; <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> Bills.</q>
               <q>The Under Sec<hi rend="sup">ys</hi> of State sent for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> &amp; <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> Agents, not knowing (as they say) where <placeName>New Castle</placeName>, <placeName>Kent</placeName>, &amp; <placeName corresp="#geonames_4144895">Sussex</placeName> were.</q>
               <q>The <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> Agent, being very ill &amp; confined to his Chamber, he cou'd not go to the Sec<hi rend="sup">ys</hi> for three Weeks or more, to set them right, &amp; so it was several Days before I knew any thing of it.</q>
               <q>Imediately on Notice, I attended the Sec<hi rend="sup">y</hi> of State, &amp; having some Int<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, I got the very Orig<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Inform<hi rend="sup">n</hi> made to them, &amp; imediately advised
<pb n="45"/>
with Council (amongst Others with the Sol<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi>) what Offence this was here, &amp; how far this Jenkens cou'd here be punisht for it.</q>
               <q>Upon great Consideration, they all agreed that it wou'd not be punishable here, &amp; advised, by all means, to let the Printer go on &amp; furnish Jenkens (who did not know he was betrayed) with what he wanted, &amp; to take Care to have some private Marks to know the Counterfeits by, &amp; to send Notice in Order to seize <persName>Jenkens</persName> &amp; <persName>Long</persName> &amp; the Cargo of Counterfeit Bills together, in <placeName>America</placeName>, where Your Laws may reach him, for fear, if <persName>Ilive</persName> refused him, he sho<hi rend="sup">d</hi> go to some Other who might carry it on unknown to Us.</q>
               <q>Accordingly, by the Sol<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gen<hi rend="sup">ls</hi> Directions, we let <persName>Ilive</persName> go on &amp; make the Bills for Jenkens, &amp; Jenkens is now going over to yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Province, or to some Neighbouring Province, with a Cargo of the Counterfeits.</q>
               <q>But its impossible for me yet, to fix what Ship he intends to go by, as there are very many Ships w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> have been a long time ready to depart, had it not been for the Embargoe, the Press, &amp; the very severe Frost, whereby some have been stopt for 5 Months past.</q>
               <q>The long stay w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> this Jenkens has been forced to make here, has made him spend all his (good) Mony, &amp; I believe he has not been able to pay the Printer what he promist him down, besides the mighty Rewards he was to expect in future.</q>
               <q>This has made <persName>Ilive</persName>, the Printer, expect not only the Reward I promist him for his Discovery, but also what Jenkens was to have paid him.</q>
               <q>I now enclose you One of the Counterfeit Bills, and the two Org<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Informations, &amp; an Orig<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Letter from <persName>Jenkens</persName> to <persName>Ilive</persName>.</q>
               <q>These Counterfeit Bills differ from the true in five particular Instances.</q>
               <q>1, 2, 3. Upon the fore Shoulder of the Lyon and of the Unicorn, &amp; at the foot of the Flying Horse in the King's Arms, there is a Speck or Dot in the Counterfeit, but not in the true.</q>
               <q>4. The Letter I. in (This Indented) is not like the I. there, in the true Bill.</q>
               <q>5. And part of the Letter P. in (Payments) is below the Line in the Counterfeits, whereas it comes no lower than the Line in the true Bill.</q>
               <q>This Discovery alone will enable you, by Proclamation, to advertise the Publick, &amp; prevent the Circulating these Counterfeits; but my aim is, that by prudent Managem<hi rend="sup">t</hi> &amp; <persName>Secrecy, Jenkens</persName> &amp; <persName>Long</persName>, (after they have been once or twice together) &amp; have added the suppos'd Names of the Signers,
<pb n="46"/>
may be detected &amp; punished, as their high and injurious Offence deserves, and to deterr Others.</q>
               <q>For otherwise, You may have the whole Currency of yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Province &amp; Countys counterfeited.</q>
               <q>If I can, before the Ships go, get any further Lights by <persName>Ilive</persName>, you may expect an Acco<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thereof, in a subsequent Letter.</q>
               <q>And by Application to the Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, Each Province may be able to save the Other, &amp; help to bring these Men to Justice.</q>
               <q>I wish I had been the only Person to whom the Secret had been communicated, I wou'd then have answered for its being kept so, but I fear the other Person to whom it was communicated, has not enough considered the Consequence of keeping the Matter quite private.<ref target="#CH4-n8">

            <p>At the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5184079">Chester County</placeName> on May 7, 1740, <persName>Jacob</persName> and <persName>Nathan Dawson</persName> (very likely brothers) were indicted for forging a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bill of credit. When they were called, only Nathan appeared. He entered a plea of not guilty and, since his witnesses were not ready, the case was continued until the next session and Nathan was released on bail. He was tried on August 26, 1740, found not guilty and discharged on payment of costs. <persName>Jacob</persName>, however, did not appear in court, and there is no evidence that he was ever tried.<ref target="#CH5-n1">

            <p>Presumably in May or very early in June, 1742, one <persName>Jacob Ebberman</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5191024">Germantown</placeName> was arrested for counterfeiting several bills of credit of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName>New Castle</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, by altering the smaller <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills to a higher denomination, and the two shilling bills of <placeName>New Castle</placeName> to twenty shilling bills and then passing them. While <persName>Christopher Ottinger</persName>, Constable of <placeName>Springfield Precinct</placeName>, was taking him to the jail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, <persName>Ebberman</persName> escaped, and the constable then offered a reward of ten pounds for his capture. The fugitive was described as "a German or Palatine" and a butcher. He was "short of stature, with jet black hair, and a pale look, a very large mouth, and his teeth wide-set in the fore part." When he made his escape, he was wearing a linen jacket and trousers and a felt hat but it was supposed that he had subsequently secured a coat of linseywoolsey of a cinnamon or brown color.<ref target="#CH5-n2">

            <p>The following spring the counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> fifteen shilling bills and the <placeName>New Castle</placeName> twenty shilling bills, which had been described in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> papers some years before, once more appeared in circulation, the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> ones dated 1733 and those
<pb n="53"/>
of <placeName>New Castle</placeName> 1729.<ref target="#CH5-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> In the <hi rend="italic">Hoch-Deutsch Pensylvanische Geschicht-Schreiber</hi> (<placeName corresp="#geonames_5191024">Germantown</placeName>) of April 16, 1743, directions were given for the detection of these counterfeits. In the false fifteen shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills there appeared among the names of the signers that of <persName>Caleb Reper</persName>, which in the genuine was <persName>Caleb Raper</persName>; in the false, beneath the words EIGHTEEN GRAINS the M of the word March stood a little to the right of the N in eighteen, while in the true bills the M was directly beneath the N in eighteen; further, the foliage in the good bills was coarsely engraved, while in the counterfeits, especially in the ring or band in the coat of arms, the engraving was fine. The <placeName>New Castle</placeName> twenty shilling counterfeit notes were very like the genuine, save that the letters in the words TWENTY SHILLINGS in the top line were not straight, while in the true bills they were absolutely even.</p>
            <p>On the morning of August 2, 1744, the authorities in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> arrested and committed to jail a man charged with counterfeiting the bills of the neighboring provinces, and on his person forged bills of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> were found in the amount of about ¬£17. It was, moreover, believed that he had passed others of this same province. The man had been betrayed by <persName>Tom Bell</persName>, a notorious rascal who had seen the inside of many jails in various provinces and to whom the counterfeiter had applied for assistance in finishing his bills.<ref target="#CH5-n4">

            </p>
            <p>By August 9 it was known that five or six men and two women had been jailed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> as accomplices in counterfeiting the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> five shilling and forty shilling bills dated 1737, and a search was underway for others concerned. The bills were printed from a poorly engraved plate, and the signers' names on the five shilling notes were engraved and printed with the bill. The mint of the money makers was a log house in a remote part of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, and, in case of success, they had planned to counterfeit several other
<pb n="54"/>
sorts of money of the neighboring provinces. Their downfall had been due to that fact that one of the gang solicited the aid of <persName>Tom Bell</persName>, who was asked to sign the bills.<ref target="#CH5-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> There appears to be no record preserved of the outcome of the affair.</p>
            <p>Whatever may have befallen the persons discovered by <persName>Bell</persName>, their fate did not put a check on counterfeiting or passing even for a brief space. <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of November 15, 1744, warned that on the previous Saturday several false one shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills had been uttered in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>. A description of them was given in these terms: "The Paper is pretty stiff and good, and some of the Bills have an Impression of a Sage Leaf, ill done, upon their Backs. If these Bills are compared with the True Ones, both being fair, many Variations may be observed both in the Signing and Printing, as the Counterfeits are a very bad Imitation of the True. Those who have not both Sorts to look at together, may take notice, that the Figures that make the Ornament or Border at the Bottom of the false Bills, which have a Resemblance of a Flower de Luce at Top, and something more under, stand apart, which in the True Bills stand close; and that in the False Bills the first I in the Word Shilling, that ends the Bill, is shorter than the last I in that Word; that the second L in the same Word is shorter than the first, and that the G is longer than the other Capitals, and made very open."</p>

               <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of November 29, 1744, carried a notice about a counterfeiter who had deserted from the army. It read:

a small Scar upon his upper Lip, and lisps in his Speech: He had on when he deserted, his regimental Cloaths, being Red, turned up with <persName>Green</persName>: a Red Waistcoat, brown Fustian Breeches, a Pair of grey ribbed Stockings, and English Shoes. He counterfeits Pistereens, and had in his Pocket, when he deserted, Pieces of hammer'd Copper, and a Phial of Quick-Silver. He served his Time to <persName>Col.

            <p>During the year 1745 considerable counterfeiting and passing of coin seem to have taken place. A certain <persName>John Thomas</persName> had the following item inserted in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of March 19, 1745:
<q>Notice is hereby given to all good People to whom these Presents shall come, of a strolling Woman, who goes under the Name of <persName>Elizabeth Castle</persName>, alias <persName>Morrey</persName>. She pretends to be a School-Mistress, Tayloress and Staymaker, Embroiderer and Doctoress. She is of little Stature, high Shouldered, grey Eyed, and very well qualified in Lying, Cheating, Defrauding, Cursing, Swearing, Drunkenness, Talebearing, Backbitting, Mischiefmaking among Neighbours, and is reported to be a Thief. She carries with her a Quantity of Pieces that shine like Gold, by which Means she hath deceived several Women and Children to their great Prejudice. She squeaks when she speaks, and hath done Damage in <persName corresp="#_">Newtown</persName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5184079">Chester County</placeName>: This is but little to what might be said within bounds of Truth."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing further is known of this extraordinary person or of the reason for <persName>Thomas</persName>'s insertion of this notice. It suggests that <persName>Elizabeth Castle</persName> passed pieces of base metal as gold coin to women and children, though, to be sure, the metal may not have been minted.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Journal, or Weekly Advertiser</hi> of May 16, 1745, reported that at <placeName>Burlington</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> a parcel of counterfeit twelve shilling bills, altered by the putting in of the word <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> at the top and bottom, had been discovered.

dated 1733, each of the denomination of twelve shillings and so badly done that anyone who could read might perceive the fraud.</p>

The indictment was delivered into the Supreme Court at its September, 1745, term by <persName>William Till</persName>, one of the judges of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. <persName>Williamson</persName> pleaded guilty and was sentenced to stand in the pillory in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> for one hour between ten and twelve in the forenoon of Saturday, October 4, and then to be discharged upon payment of the costs of prosecution.<ref target="#CH5-n7">

The coins he was alleged to have passed were described as half pieces of eight or pieces of eight, and the witness against him was one <persName>Joseph Inslee</persName>. The case was put off from term to term until September, 1746, when the indictment was preferred to the grand jury and returned Ignoramus, whereupon the defendant was discharged upon paying his fees.<ref target="#CH5-n9">

            <p>Bosworth was admitted to bail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5182201">Bucks County</placeName>, and on September 17, 1747, he was indicted at the Court of Quarter Sessions of that county for counterfeiting a twelve shilling bill. When he was called, however, he did not appear. At the December term of this court it is recorded that he was to be tried for passing a false twelve shilling bill, knowing it to be such, and that the witness for the King was <persName>James Simson</persName>.

The notes were so badly printed and signed that only a person not accustomed to see <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills could be deceived by them. The lines were very crooked, the letters and figures much misshapen and disproportioned, the flourishes and arms very dull and blindly impressed, and several of the words scarcely legible.<ref target="#CH5-n16">

Various others were likewise taken up there for having made Spanish dollars, and it appeared that a considerable number of persons were engaged in the work, among whom were good artists who could make the copper white and tough and prepare moulds and dies. The counterfeits were like the true coins in all respects save that they could not withstand testing in fire. Hence the countrymen could not be warned about them, though persons who knew silver well could detect them and would refuse to accept them. As a result the poor, simple people would have the loss from the false pieces. The gang also was making dollars of pewter, coated with silver, and these the most simple person could discover, since they did not ring like silver.<ref target="#CH5-n18">

A petition from these prisoners, then in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> jail, was read before the Provincial Council on September 25, 1747. They requested that the Council remit the sentence, since they were willing to serve in the army anywhere in the King's dominions that the council might direct. The opinion of the board was "that as there is reason to believe from the sundry Examinations taken in <placeName>Jersey</placeName> &amp; other places, that there is a great number concern'd in this most pernicious Practice of coining, if the Prisoners will discover all their Accomplices, &amp; make a full &amp; fair Confession of all that they know relating to themselves &amp; their Confederates, that they may be entitled to Mercy; but suspend their determination on the Petition till they know what is to be expected of this kind from the Petitioners, &amp; in case they are inclin'd to make an honest discovery, the Chief Justice is desir'd to take their Examinations."<ref target="#CH5-n19">

               </ref> That of <persName>Stephen Barnes</persName>, late of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4835395">Greenwich</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, blacksmith, is to the following effect: about three years before one <persName>Thomas Dote</persName>, at that time a constable of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, informed him (<persName>Barnes</persName>) that a certain <persName>John Bellamy</persName> was suspected of counterfeiting Spanish pistoles, and
<pb n="61"/>
that he (<persName>Dote</persName>) upon the order of <persName>Justice Anderson</persName> had gone to the house of one <persName>Edmund Robinson</persName>, where, upon search there had been found in <persName>Bellamy</persName>'s pocketbook the following items: three pieces of eight which were probably good, four counterfeit pistoles, about ¬£80 in false <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode Island</placeName> money and a counterfeit <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> five shilling bill.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>John Bellamy</persName> was no novice at the counterfeiting game, for beyond reasonable doubt he may be identified with a blacksmith of that name who in 1735 was living in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4835395">Greenwich</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>. On January 23 of that year <persName>Solomon Close</persName>, a grandjuryman, made complaint against <persName>Bellamy</persName> to <persName>Nathaniel Peck</persName>, a justice of the peace. On a writ issued by the justice <persName>Bellamy</persName> was apprehended by <persName>William Reynolds</persName>, constable of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4835395">Greenwich</placeName>. <persName>Justice Peck</persName> examined him the same day and ordered him confined in jail on suspicion of having coined and passed false half pistoles. <persName>Thomas Hill</persName>, the sheriff, however, released his prisoner on bail but at the Superior Court held at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4834157">Fairfield</placeName> on February 25, 1735, <persName>Bellamy</persName> failed to appear, so that the sheriff was ordered to pay a fine of ¬£100.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Bellamy</persName>, however, did not escape so easily, for on April 30 <persName>Constable Reynolds</persName> complained against him to <persName>Justice Ebenezer Mead</persName>. A writ was issued, <persName>Bellamy</persName> was taken up and bound over to the next Superior Court in bail of ¬£500, which was furnished by <persName>Gershom Lockwood</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4835395">Greenwich</placeName>. At the session of the court held at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4834157">Fairfield</placeName> in August, 1735, it was charged that <persName>Bellamy</persName> at his shop in the Parish of Horseneck in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4835395">Greenwich</placeName> had made Spanish half pistoles of brass and other mixed metals. It was stated by one <persName>Abraham Todd</persName>, one of the witnesses against him, that he had seen <persName>Bellamy</persName> with iron dies, had remonstrated with him about his bad conduct and told him what a grief he would be to his father. The grand jury, nevertheless, returned the indictment Ignoramus. Yet he was still in difficulties on account of his failure to appear in court in February and in October he petitioned the General Assembly to permit him to give a bond of ¬£100 and have the sentence against <persName>Sheriff Hill</persName> declared fully satisfied.<ref target="#CH5-n22">

            <p>Early in 1739 <persName>Samuel Darling</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839366">New Haven</placeName> traced a bogus <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> 5/ bill back to <persName>Bellamy</persName>, who was living in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4845056">Wallingford</placeName>, and it appeared that <persName>Bellamy</persName> was both the forger and the passer. <persName>Darling</persName> complained to <persName>Joseph Whiting</persName>, assistant, on February 27 and a writ was issued directing either the Sheriff of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839373">New Haven County</placeName> or the Constable of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4845056">Wallingford</placeName> to search for bills, plates or counterfeiting materials and to arrest <persName>Bellamy</persName> or anyone else concerned. <persName>Bellamy</persName> was apprehended and released on bail of ¬£300 furnished by himself and his father, <persName>Matthew Bellamy, Sr.</persName>, for his appearance at the Superior Court to be held in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839366">New Haven</placeName> in August, 1739. <persName>John</persName> was present in court on the second day of the session and was indicted for having, about the middle of February, passed two counterfeit <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> 5/ bills. On the next day he was called three times but did not appear; his bail was declared forfeited, while <persName>Darling</persName>, as informer, received a reward of ¬£20.<ref target="#CH5-n23">
                  <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
               </ref> It was doubtless at this time that the blacksmith moved southward, only to continue his nefarious work in another province.</p>
            <p>Some twelve months earlier <persName>Dote</persName> informed <persName>Barnes</persName> that he (<persName>Dote</persName>), <persName>Folker Folkerson</persName> and <persName>Anthony Hutchins</persName> were to have a pair of dies or stamps, for coining pieces of eight, made for them by a certain <persName>Bruff</persName> of <placeName>Elizabethtown</placeName>, and that <persName>Folker Folkerson</persName> paid ¬£120 for them. Later <persName>Barnes</persName> saw such a set of dies in the custody of <persName>Peter Ulrick</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, dies which, he was informed by his fellow prisoner, <persName>John Jones</persName>, had been secured by <persName>Ulrick</persName> from <persName>Folker Folkerson</persName>.</p>
            <p>In the examination it was further stated that <persName>Dote</persName> had offered to employ <persName>Barnes</persName> to assist him and others in counterfeiting pieces of eight; that <persName>John Jones</persName> told him (<persName>Barnes</persName>) of another set of stamps for coining pieces of eight which was in the custody of a younger
<pb n="63"/>
brother of <persName>Folker Folkerson</persName> (or <persName>Folkerston</persName>); and finally that <persName>John McNeal</persName> and <persName>Hans Davacutt</persName> were partners with him in a design for coining the Spanish money.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>John Jones</persName>, late of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2654675">Bristol</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, smelter, in his examination largely corroborated <persName>Barnes</persName>'s story. In the spring of 1747, at <persName>Barnes</persName>'s house, there had been discussion of a mine at <placeName>Lamacunk</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> and there were several persons at the mine, among them <persName>Anthony Hutchins</persName>, who "behaved as if he were principally concern'd." <persName>Jones</persName> spoke of <persName>Dote</persName>, of <persName>Bruff</persName>'s making a set of dies for striking pieces of eight, and of the purchase of the set by <persName>Dote</persName>, <persName>Folkerson</persName> and <persName>Hutchins</persName>. In addition he related his going with one <persName>Campbell</persName> and others to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5095860">Bound Brook</placeName> to the house of <persName>Folker Folkerson</persName>'s brother, where he saw a set of dies and where <persName>John McNeal</persName> showed him some metal. A certain <persName>Hans Davacutt</persName> offered <persName>Jones</persName> ¬£20 if he would make this metal malleable but <persName>Jones</persName> said that it could not be done since it was base metal.</p>
            <p>These examinations had not satisfied the members of the Provincial Council, but before the sentence was executed on the two prisoners the council again took up their case, on October 22, when it was represented that the clerk employed to take down their confession had omitted a material part thereof, namely that <persName>Jones</persName> had thrown the dies for making dollars into the river. Thereupon the council directed the sheriff to make further enquiry into this circumstance and to report back to the council if the dies were found; if they were not found, he was at once to execute the sentence against <persName>Barnes</persName> and <persName>Jones</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n24">

            </p>
            <p>By November 9 the petitioners had told the sheriff the exact place where the dies had been thrown, and the sheriff had found them and produced them to the council. It was then ordered that the pillorying of <persName>Barnes</persName> and <persName>Jones</persName> be remitted but that the residue of their sentence be performed. In addition <persName>Mr. Lawrence</persName> and <persName>Mr. Till</persName> were instructed to be a committee to see the dies utterly defaced and then to produce

            </p>
            <p>Petitions from <persName>Jones</persName> and <persName>Barnes</persName> were read before the council on Friday, June 3, 1748, praying that they might be released from jail if they enlisted to serve his Majesty, and their prayers were promptly granted.<ref target="#CH5-n27">

            <p>Apparently the <persName>John McNeal</persName>, mentioned by both <persName>Barnes</persName> and <persName>Jones</persName> as concerned in counterfeiting metal, turned to forging and passing bills of credit of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, for on August 20, 1748, <persName corresp="#viaf_53152838">Robert Hunter Morris</persName>, Chief Justice of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, issued his warrant to the High Sheriff of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5104759">Somerset County</placeName> to arrest <persName>McNeal</persName> for that crime. The warrant also called for the arrest of <persName>McNeal</persName>'s accomplices, who were mentioned as follows: <persName>Jacobus Vanetta</persName>, <persName>Robert Levingston</persName>, <persName>David Brant</persName>, <persName>Court Timery</persName>, <persName>Isaac Woortman</persName>, <persName>Ebenezer Doud</persName>, <persName>Abraham Anderson</persName>, <persName>Peter Salter</persName>, <persName>Joshua Robins</persName> and <persName>Abraham Southerd</persName>. The High Sheriff was also instructed to search their homes and all likely hiding places and to seize all tools or materials for counterfeiting either bills or coins as well as all such counterfeit money.<ref target="#CH5-n28">

            <p>It would seem that many, and perhaps all, of the persons sought were not to be found. In any event, on August 20, <persName>Chief Justice Morris</persName> issued another warrant, this time to the Sheriff of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, <persName>John Kinney</persName>, to make a similar search and seizure and to arrest <persName>Job Allen</persName>, <persName>John Pipes</persName>, <persName>Andrew Morrison</persName>, <persName>Abraham Hathaway</persName>, <persName>Jonathan Hathaway</persName>, <persName>Seth Hall</persName>, <persName>Jacobus Vannatta</persName>, <persName>John McNeal</persName>, <persName>Joshua Robins</persName>, <persName>Abraham Anderson</persName>, <persName>Robert Levingston</persName>, <persName>Court Timeray</persName> and <persName>Isaac Woortman</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n29">

            <p>Not long after this case <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of October 22, 1747, printed the following warning:
<q>Our Readers are cautioned to beware of a new Parcel of Counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName> Fifteen Shilling Bills, just beginning to appear among us. They are in Imitation of the newest Money, dated July 2, 1746, and may be known by these Particulars: The Paper of the Counterfeits is thin and smooth, and when look'd thro' in the Light, appears fair and free from Knots: the Paper of the true Bills is thicker, rougher, and when look'd thro' in the Light appears clouded and uneven: The Counterfeits are wholly done from a Copper-plate, the Back as well as the Foreside; the true Bills are printed from common Types, in the common Printing-Press: The three Crowns by the Side of the Arms in the Counterfeits are unlike each other, and more round than those in the true Bills, which are like each other, and the same with this <graphic url="NNM132_078a.jpg"/> The Flowers above and below those Crowns are in the true Bills the same with this <graphic url="NNM132_078b.jpg"/> in the Counterfeit they are nothing like: The Value of the Bill just over the Signers Names in the true Bills is in the same Characters as here XV <hi rend="smallcaps">Shillings</hi> ‚Ä° in the Counterfeits the Letters of the Word <hi rend="italic">Shillings</hi> are larger. There are many other Marks by which they may be distinguished, but these, we hope, will be sufficient at present.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The same newspaper of October 29, 1747, warned that a new impression of the counterfeit fifteen shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills had appeared, done on thicker paper and a better imitation of the genuine ones than those described on October 22. The <hi rend="italic">Pensylvanische Berichte</hi> of November 16, repeated the description of some of the marks by which the false <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> fifteen shilling bills could be recognized but it also added further details: of the three crowns near the coat of arms the uppermost was smaller than the lower two; the word XV Shillings was badly engraved; in the false bills the <graphic url="NNM132_078c.jpg"/> stood directly above the V and in the good bills it was above it to the left; in the good bills the <hi rend="italic">L√∂b</hi>[Lion ?] had a crown on the head and in the false bills a cap. There were besides very many marks in the false
<pb n="66"/>
bills which could be rubbed out or scratched, so that whenever the marks of distinction were erased or the place was uncommonly dirty, that in itself was suspicious.</p>
            <p>The account in the German paper then continued as follows:
<q>Sometimes before false paper money has been made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> and brought into this country and invariably has been discovered at once. Now, however, it seems as if such a master has come into the country. An order has been placed in a paper mill for such paper as is to be white on one side and gray on the other, as the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> money is; thus they will want to pass the Jersey money in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> money in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>.</q>
               <q>They might as well, however, let it be, for it is quite impossible for one to imitate paper money so that it will be like the genuine in all details; unless one has the same letter, flowers, foliage and all details wherewith the genuine money was made, and if one should think that he had done everything successfully, yet the printer has other secret signs of which another person does not think. The poor man accepts the counterfeit and cannot keep it long; whoever has doubts about it then goes to the printer. The printer knows his own work, and thus the matter becomes apparent. It is shameful for one to try to support himself in this fashion, for usually the poor or the stupid or simple people have to suffer from it if they want to buy something or pay their debts when those who understand it do not take the money from them or when they make a cross through it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The same item warned also of false twelve shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills, dated March 25, 1733. They were in part sullied and patched as though they were old; the two moons were smaller than in the good bills, and anyone who held a genuine bill next to a counterfeit could easily recognize it.</p>
            <p>Counterfeit six shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills were also reported to be circulating, and the writer of the item, probably <persName corresp="#viaf_34890457">Christopher Sauer</persName>, remarked that no one needed to accept suspicious money unless he knew the man who would take it from him again, while on the last <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> money was printed: To Counterfeit is Death.</p>
            <p>A few days later <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of November 19, 1747, described the false six shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills. They were dated
<pb n="67"/>
July 2, 1746, and done wholly from an engraved copperplate, while the genuine bills were printed with common types. In addition to other marks the counterfeits could be detected by the fact that the S in the word [<hi rend="italic">SILVER</hi>] was much larger than the rest of the same word, while the s in <hi rend="italic">Grains</hi> was very badly made S; in the border of flowers around the sage leaf on the back of the counterfeits the flourishing was more open, loose and irregular than in the true bills. Likewise the strokes representing the fibres of the leaf did not appear as naturally rough as in the true bills; the S in the word SIX at the top of the counterfeits was much smaller than the IX, and the letters in SHILLINGS at the top of the false notes stood very crooked.<ref target="#CH5-n31">

            <p>Two of the persons concerned in putting out these counterfeits were <persName>John Lummis</persName>, a native of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5223505">Narraganset</placeName> and a blacksmith, and <persName>"Dr." Joseph Bradford</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839416">New London</placeName>, who sometimes used this name and sometimes that of <persName>James</persName> or <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>. They were arrested at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5098706">Hackensack</placeName> early in December for uttering false <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills. One of them, when first apprehended, made an excuse to go behind a barrack, where he was seen to stick something in it. The object was revealed to be a large bundle of bills, which, together with others found on their persons, made in all 102 bills of fifteen shillings each, of which thirty-six were signed, 142 bills of twelve shillings each, of which eight were signed, and 89 bills of six shillings each, of which twenty-seven were signed. Some of the six shilling bills were dated 1743 and others 1746.<ref target="#CH5-n32">

            <p>
               <persName>Bill</persName> quickly associated himself in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> with <persName>Isaac Jones</persName> and <persName>Jonathan Bryant</persName> in the counterfeiting of bills of credit and these
<pb n="68"/>
rogues enlisted a number of persons as passers of their product. <persName>Bryant</persName> was apprehended in 1749 but he managed to warn <persName>Jones</persName> and <persName>Bill</persName>. The pair made their escape from an island near <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> and went to work again in the woods at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4945283">Newton</placeName>, where they were seized and then taken to jail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4931972">Cambridge</placeName>. While they were being transferred to prison in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName>, they eluded their guards at Watertown. Bill was apparently taken up in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> by <persName>Paul Welch</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839435">New Milford</placeName> but he soon broke out of the jail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4835797">Hartford</placeName>. In March, 1749, <persName>Jones</persName> and <persName>Bill</persName> were conveyed across to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5134800">Sag Harbor</placeName> on <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125123">Long Island</placeName> by one <persName>Jedediah Ashcraft</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5281020">Groton</placeName>, who described Bill to the authorities as a tall man, not thick of body and well dressed.

            <p>The <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> authorities rightly suspected that an organized gang was forging the currency of the province. <persName corresp="#viaf_62352405">Governor Jonathan Belcher</persName>, in an address to the council and assembly of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> on Thursday, November 19, 1747, said: "I am, <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen</hi>, in the next Place to acquaint you, that I have lately received from one <persName>Mr. Hopkins</persName>, a Magistrate in <hi rend="italic">Rhode-Island</hi> Government, a Number of counterfeited Bills of this Province, which <persName>Mr. Secretary</persName> shall deliver you. We are obliged to this Gentleman for his good Care; and from this, and other Informations of the like Kind, I have reason to believe there is a Knot, or Combination of villainous Persons, that are making a Trade of forging the Bills of this Province; And this Matter well deserves your speedy Care and strict Enquiry, as it strikes at the very Vitals of your Currency, and so must nearly affect not only your Commerce, but your other Estates also."<ref target="#CH5-n37">

            <p>About mid-August, 1748, there came a report from <placeName>Anweil</placeName> and its vicinity that there was a large band of money makers, among whom were supposed to be important and wealthy persons. Some apparently acted openly and others secretly, and they had used the services of a printer, one <persName>Heinrich Jaeger</persName>, who admitted that he had made ¬£40 himself but had passed only a fifteen shilling bill. For his crime he was tried at a Court of Oyer and Terminer for counterfeiting the current money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, was convicted and hanged in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5105496">Trenton</placeName> on Saturday, July 16, 1748, leaving behind a wife and nine children, most of whom were small. Further, at the gallows his wife had a fine or tax of ¬£50 imposed on her. One of the gang, who had turned King's evidence against him at the trial, was no sooner released than he bought a horse with counterfeit money but was overtaken and imprisoned. It was reported that the false money was being passed
<pb n="70"/>
in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> and various remote place by persons who knew nothing of it. Several persons, in addition to <persName>Jaeger</persName> (or <persName>Yager</persName>) were arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of being guilty of the same crime, and it was said that the government was determined to exert itself in detecting and punishing this growing evil.<ref target="#CH5-n38">

            <p>In October, 1748, <persName>Daniel</persName> and <persName>Rebecca Johns</persName> and <persName>Stephen Phillips</persName> were convicted, presumably at the Mayor's Court of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, of coining and passing false pieces of eight. At a meeting of the Common Council of the city on January 8, 1749, a petition from them was read, wherein they claimed that this was their first offence and that their crime was due to their extreme ignorance of its nature and mischievous consequences. They explained that they were very poor and lacked the means to pay the heavy fines which had been imposed on them. Their pleading was successful, and the council promptly remitted their fines.<ref target="#CH5-n39">

            <p>The public in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> was cautioned in November, 1748, to beware of counterfeit twenty shilling <placeName>New Castle</placeName> bills dated March 1, 1734. All were done from copperplate, while the genuine ones were made from common printing letters. The false bills might be detected by comparing all the letters of the same sort, especially f with the f's in the line, Act of Assembly of this Government of; the f's in the three of's were alike in the true bills but unlike each other in the counterfeits. The signing of the false notes was very badly executed.<ref target="#CH5-n40">

            <p>Counterfeit Spanish doubloons were found circulating in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> in December, 1748, and January, 1749. <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of December 20 reported: "Some ‚Ä¶ have been found, on Trial, to contain little more than Eleven Penny-weight of Gold, and the rest Copper. They may be distinguished from the true Ones, by the Roughness of the Impression, which is not struck or stamped
<pb n="71"/>
as in the true Ones, but cast in Sand; and by the Roundness and Smoothness of the Edges, which are hammer'd up after Casting." A more lengthy account of the same coins was given in the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvanische Berichte</hi> of January 16, 1749: they were circulating among the simple people and were, in general, heavy, but could be recognized by the fact that the lower part was rougher than the upper; they were cast in sand and not struck, and hence the bottom part was rough and the upper part hammered smooth; they were mixed with copper and quicksilver, and therefore no larger than the genuine coins; some contained so much quicksilver that it shone out on the edge and had white spots; if they were thrown down on a stone, they would fall to pieces; some were hammered round on the edge; if they were tested in a cupel, it was found that some were only half gold; others were only twelve shillings less in value, while still others lacked thirty to forty shillings in value.</p>
            <p>Other false coin was likewise passing at this time, namely three sorts of milled dollars, two dated 1741 and the other 1744. In the counterfeits dated 1744 the R and A in VTRAQUE stood too far apart, so as to make VTRAQUE look like two distinct words. As for those dated 1741 (see illustration opposite p. 76), one sort might be known because the A in HISPAN was much too small for the rest of the letters; in the other sort the space where the date was placed was much broader than in the true coins; also the left side of the crown on the left hand pillar was directly under the A in VTRAQUE, but in the true dollars the same left side of the crown fell between the R and the A; all of these dollars were well milled at the edges but in general the letters were not so well made and regular as in genuine pieces. The counterfeits were of base metal and contained but two shillings eight pence worth of silver and the rest copper; if a bit of the surface, which was silvered over, were scraped away and the place sullied by rubbing on the short hair of a man's head, then the brassy complexion would appear. The counterfeits, if placed on the end of a finger and struck with a small key, all yielded a shriller sound than the true ones. Before January 24, 1749, several Germans had
<pb n="72"/>
been arrested and imprisoned for being concerned in uttering them but the principal workman had fled, presumably with his tools.<ref target="#CH5-n41">

            </p>
            <p>Shortly before February 14, 1749, a person was arrested in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> "on suspicion of being concerned in coining of Spanish Rix-dollars,"<ref target="#CH5-n42">
                  <hi rend="sup">42</hi>
               </ref> and soon <persName corresp="#viaf_34890457">Christopher Sauer</persName> in his <placeName corresp="#geonames_5191024">Germantown</placeName> newspaper printed a lengthy article about the coining which was going on. Since his last article, that of January 16, on the subject, some new types of Spanish doubloons had appeared. He wrote:
<q>The doubloons are not rough like those last reported but rather smooth and thick; these also are not all like one another; some are particularly thick in the middle and of very pale gold. The merchants in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> call them "<placeName corresp="#geonames_5191024">Germantown</placeName> doubloons." The other type appears like the good ones, so that even the goldsmiths cannot recognize and differentiate them from their appearance. A merchant in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> is said to have taken in such a doubloon and to have sent it to a goldsmith and asked if it was good. The goldsmith replied that it was good. The merchant had doubts and sent it to another goldsmith, who also reported that it was genuine. At this the merchant sent it to a third goldsmith, who tested the interior of the doubloon and found that it was only half gold. If, then, goldsmiths cannot differentiate the coins by their appearance, how is the farmer, who has, indeeed, had little gold in his hands, to recognize them?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Sauer</persName> continued with the statement that three sorts of false dollars were also circulating. As long as they were new, their exterior was as white as that of the genuine ones. The flowers outside on the edge were as clear as in the true and in the impression differed little from the genuine, though it was possible to recognize them. Only dollars bearing the dates 1741 and 1744 were so far suspicious, and, to recognize the false coins, much the same directions were given as had been published in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of January 24, 1749. <persName>Sauer</persName> added, however, that on one variety of the counterfeits dated 1741 the space before the date was broader than in the true money. He also suggested that in the case of suspicious dollars one should
<pb n="73"/>
shave a spot and rub the place with saliva, whereupon the copper would shine through, as the coins were coated with a silver wash. "It is apparent," he concluded, "that they are being made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5191024">Germantown</placeName> and it has become well enough known through the country who the coiner, his helper, and his helper's helpers are."<ref target="#CH5-n43">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Pensylvanische Berichte</hi> of March 1, 1749, <persName>Sauer</persName> informed his readers that since his article of two weeks before three further types of Spanish dollars had appeared, all dated 1742. In addition there were two other sorts, one dated 1744 and one dated 1737. Such counterfeits were not so neatly struck, for the bad metal was hard and not so easy to coin. For this reason the impression was more blotchy and, if the counterfeits were scraped and rubbed with saliva, the copper appeared reddish, while genuine coins remained white as fine silver and rang almost the same, the one as the other, but the false ones rang either much clearer or very badly.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Thomas Penn</persName> was informed of the counterfeiting, either about this time or a little later, and on September 7, 1749, wrote from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> to <persName corresp="#viaf_9711783">Lynford Lardner</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> in these terms: "I am concerned to find that you have been so much imposed on with the Counterfeit Doubloons but think the method you have taken of weighing them will secure you against any loss. if pieces of eight are also adulterated, the damage will be much greater as I suppose their value is ten times more than the Gold, and how the five thousand just arrived will turn out we shall soon know."<ref target="#CH5-n44">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The false coiners, however, soon came to grief, as is shown by the article printed in <persName>Sauer</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">Pensylvanische Berichte</hi> of March 16, 1749, whose translation from the German is as follows:
<q>One could have written the sheet full of what has taken place in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, if one had wanted to describe, from the devil's kingdom (which made its beginning with men through cunning, lies and deceit), what the names of the money coiners and their colleagues were, how they began and carried on the business, how they were discovered, apprehended, and
<pb n="74"/>
examined, what they confessed, denied and held back, etc., etc., etc. All this however, would have been of no use; another person of more evil intent could have learned still further wickedness from it; in place of it there has been introduced into the newspaper a beneficent reminder and warning with regard to that kind of activity in the future, for the good of others and of these mentioned, in order to warn all Germans in the whole country that in the future no one may any longer incur that kind of sin and shame to their own injury and that of others, not at all out of passion and hatred against anyone, but for their profit and improvement. Immediately thereupon one of those struck by it, who does not want, as it seems, to mend his ways, or it may be that there are more than one of these, has had printed in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> German Fauna a libel against <persName>Sauer</persName>, to which he is not willing to answer a word, except that he is not willing in the future to desist from printing in the paper whatever redounds to the honor of God, serves for his neighbor's benefit and for the disclosure and discovery of the realm of the devil, whether it be a question of living swindlers, of cutpurses in the body or in the spirit or whether they be as dead as Judas, about whom it is still written seventeen hundred years after his death: "He was a thief." One may to his heart's content hereafter scold, slander and defame <persName>Sauer</persName>, tell lies about him or write what one wants, he will utterly disregard it, and, if someone wants to print something in the paper to the aforementioned purpose, he may send it in free. <persName>Sauer</persName> will be glad to allow himself to be scolded, dishonored and vilified; but no one is to expect scolding and vilifying in return; that kind of thing he will leave to bad boys and the like, and he will act as one who goes his way and allows each bird to sing its song according to its fashion, for, so long as the devil still has children and servants, it is not to be expected that anyone who has as his aim the slightest good or useful thing might remain unattacked.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately <persName>Sauer</persName> had named no names, but the persons arrested were tried, convicted and sentenced the last week in September, 1749, when the SupremeCourt had before it the cases of a number of coiners. Two were probably the Dutchmen named <persName>Hawke</persName>, who had been committed to jail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> during the second week in September on suspicion of being concerned in counterfeiting doubloons and pieces of eight.<ref target="#CH5-n45">
                  <hi rend="sup">45</hi>
               </ref> Others were beyond question persons tried at a
<pb n="75"/>
Court of Oyer and Terminer held in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5182201">Bucks County</placeName> during the second week in September. At this court "several Indictments were found against Persons concern'd in Coining and Uttering bad Silver and Gold Money." One of these, convicted of coining, was fined ¬£40 and sentenced to stand one hour in the pillory on October 5; two were convicted of having agreed with several others to make base metal pass for silver and gold. Since, however, some questions arose as to rendering a judgment on the verdict of the jury, the determination was deferred to the Supreme Court, which was to be held the last week in September.<ref target="#CH5-n46">
                  <hi rend="sup">46</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is probable that the two men named <persName>Hawke</persName>, the three persons from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5182201">Bucks County</placeName>, and individuals taken in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5191024">Germantown</placeName> were associates. This, however, is not definitely established, and the account given by <persName>Sauer</persName> in the <hi rend="italic">Pensylvanische Berichte</hi> of October 16, 1749, apparently is concerned only with persons arrested long before the Hawkes or the individuals from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5182201">Bucks County</placeName>. He states that the case of the money makers came to an end at the Supreme Court during the last week in September, after the accused had been a full year in prison or going about on bail. Their lawyer could make no better plea than that the jurymen themselves should reflect carefully before imposing too severe a judgment. And the judgment was, indeed, a mild one: one of the coiners of silver was fined ¬£40, another ¬£20 and another ¬£5, while each of the coiners of gold was sentenced to pay a fine of ¬£10.</p>
            <p>There was, at the close of 1749, a plague of counterfeits in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, this time of forged paper bills of credit. <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of November 30, 1749, desired its readers "to beware of Counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Twenty Shilling Bills, which have lately appear'd among us: The Words, Arms, and Ornaments, of the Counterfeits, are done with a Pen; whereas the Words of the True Ones are done with Printing Letters, and the Ornaments, &amp;c. cut. Also of Counterfeit Jersey Six Shilling Bills; the Impression is very black and fresh, they are done from a very bad Copperplate, and the
<pb n="76"/>
Letters are so badly proportioned, and stand so irregular, that they may be easily discover'd. The True Ones are likewise done with Printing Letters. The Counterfeits of both Sorts may be seen at the Post-Office."</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pensylvanische Berichte</hi>, which appeared the next day, December 1, gave a detailed description of what were apparently quite different counterfeits of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> twenty shilling bills. These were dated August 10, 1739, bore four crowns, and had appeared after some ships arrived in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> with Newcomers and Newlanders. The bills were well executed, save that the crowns were a little too pointed, especially on the right; there were a couple of other marks of distinction, which, however, the swindler could easily change. But the clearest mark was the fact that the paper of the counterfeits was whiter than that of the true bills, for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> money was intentionally made so that one side of bill was white and the other grey; the false bills were patched, and on the back each one had a piece stuck on though they were not torn, and they were on purpose sullied, as if they were already old. In spite of the fact that they were well executed, as soon as a printer saw them, he would know them as certainly as a weaver of linen knows what is linen or half linen and it could not be hidden. If the swindler made them correctly, the words, "To Counterfeit is Death," would be on the back.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of December 12 warned against forged threepenny bills, done from copperplate but so badly executed that they might be known at first sight; the newspaper cautioned the public to be on guard against ninepenny, sixpenny and fourpenny bills which might also have been counterfeited.<ref target="#CH5-n47">

            <p>In February, 1751, the public was cautioned to beware of hammered, unmilled counterfeit pieces of eight. They seemed to have been cast in sand and then hammered smooth towards the sides, though the ground within the figured part appeared rough.

He pretends to be a Weaver, and says he lives at <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q542454">Bethlehem</placeName>, in the Jerseys, with one <persName>William M'Cracken</persName>. The Pieces are cast in Sand, and are filed upon the Milling; they look very rough, and are more of a Lead than Silver Colour, and sound like Brass."<ref target="#CH6-n21">
                  <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
               </ref> The same paper of February 25, 1752, announced that the previous week <persName>Kerr</persName> had been indicted, tried and convicted at the Mayor's Court and had received the following sentence: "to stand in the Pillory one Hour To-morrow, to have his Ear nail'd to the same, and the Part nail'd cut off: And on Saturday next to stand another Hour in the Pillory, and to be whipt Thirty-nine Lashes, at the Cart's Tail, round two Squares; and then to pay a Fine of Fifty Pounds."</p>
            <p>This sentence was also mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Pensylvanische Berichte</hi> of March 1, 1752. This German newspaper, however, added two paragraphs which read as follows:</p>
            <p>"<persName>Daniel M√ºller</persName>, <persName>Edward Durry</persName> and <persName>Edward Blayster</persName> were likewise examined and declared guilty of death, and it was ordered that they be lashed tomorrow (February 26)."</p>

            <p>From the above it would appear that <persName>M√ºller</persName>, <persName>Durry</persName> and <persName>Blayster</persName> were probably the accomplices denounced by <persName>Kerr</persName> to save his ear. <persName>Kerr</persName> finally stood in the pillory on a Saturday late in October and was whipped at the cart's tail round two squares.<ref target="#CH6-n22">

            <p>At a meeting of the Common Council of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> on November 17, 1752, a petition from <persName>Kerr</persName> was read. He was in prison, for he had been unable to pay his fine of ¬£50, since he was "afflicted w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> sickness and reduced to great Poverty." He therefore prayed that the fine might be remitted. The Council was informed that he was really unable to pay the sum but that there was a "Charge against him in the Jerseys of a high Nature, which the detaining him here prevents his being called to Account for." It was thereupon referred to the recorder, if he should see cause to deliver <persName>Kerr</persName> to the <placeName>Jersey</placeName> officers.<ref target="#CH6-n23">

            <p>At about this time the public was likewise warned against counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> twenty shilling bills, dated October, 1748, and done from a very bad copperplate. In them the S in the word CRESCITE seemed to be inverted; the C next to it, in the same word, was shorter than the other letters. The whole bill, however, was so badly cut that these counterfeits must be detected at first sight, especially as the genuine <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> bills were most beautifully engraved.<ref target="#CH6-n50">

            <p>It was probably during the summer of 1757 that <persName>Joshua Potter</persName> and <persName>William Pettyjohn</persName> were convicted of coining. Presumably they were sentenced to stand in the pillory or to be lashed, or both, and certainly to be fined, for while in jail at <placeName>Lewes</placeName> they petitioned the Provincial Council for the remission of their fines. The Council on August 25, 1757, decided that they must continue in prison for some time, to be discharged later on entering as soldiers or sailors into the King's service.<ref target="#CH6-n51">

            <p>According to a <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> dispatch published in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> Evening</hi> Post of November 3, 1760, one <persName>John Bruleman</persName>, who was executed on October 8, 1760, for the murder of a <persName>Mr. Scull</persName>, had formerly been an officer in the Royal American Regiment but had been detected counterfeiting or uttering counterfeit money and had been discharged from the service. It is not clear, however, whether his counterfeiting was a recent occurrance, but that would seem probable from the account found in <persName>Weyman</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> Gazette</hi> of October 20, 1760, which adds that <persName>Bruleman</persName> was a silversmith by trade before he entered the army and that upon his discharge he "returned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, and growing insupportable to himself‚Ä¶ determined upon the commission of some crime, for which he might get hang'd by the law‚Ä¶"</p>
            <p>Late in June, 1761, the authorities in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> arrested men believed responsible for altering <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> six shilling bills to six pound bills and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> two pound bills to ten pound bills.

When <persName>Ichabod Higgins</persName>, <persName>Lewis</persName> and <persName>Cooly</persName> were apprehended, <persName>John Higgins</persName>, a man of about thirty years of age who had been born of a good family at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4744091">Alexandria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>, was absent on one of his frequent trips to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> to change altered money through the Jerseys and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH7-n1">

Wherever the denomination of the bill stood, the false amount was pasted on, so that, to detect the counterfeits, the people were to check the color of the notes at these spots or to look for erasures, for it was difficult for the criminal to make all the changes so that there would not be at least one place where the alteration would be visible.<ref target="#CH7-n4">

"They are badly done," ran the notice, "on a Copperplate, dated April 8, 1762, and are printed in three Folds of Paper, pasted together, the Letters in the whole Bill being very irregular, and standing much out of Line; whereas the true Bills are neatly and regularly done in the common Printing Manner, and printed on two Folds of Paper. In the first Line of the Face of the Counterfeit, the O in POUNDS is shorter and thicker than the other Letters in that Word, and in the third Line the last E in <placeName>JERSEY</placeName>, is not like a printing E, but is made in the Manner commonly used in Writing.

            <p>The counterfeiter, it appears, or one of the counterfeiters, of the three pound bill, and very likely also of the thirty shilling one, was a certain Billings. <persName corresp="#viaf_78643734">Benjamin Lightfoot</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5207728">Reading</placeName>, on the 2 mo. 17th. 1763, wrote to <persName>James Pemberton</persName>:

There were two emissions of the thirty shilling denomination, dated 1762 and 1764, of which the first was badly done and might be discovered from the whole face of the bill, on which the letters ran into the escutcheon. On the other hand, those dated 1764 were so well executed that they could only with difficulty be detected. In fact, the only sure mark was that on the back of the counterfeits, at the stem of the sage leaf, 30 was left out of 30 s., which appeared in the genuine ones.

so well printed as the true ones; the impression of the forged notes was deeper in the paper, and in the word PLATE the P was directly over the A of APRIL, which was not the case in the genuine money.

               <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of March 3, 1768, reported that attempts had been made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> to pass <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> bills of the denomination of the sixth part of a dollar, altered to six dollars. They were so poorly done that they might be discovered at first sight: the word <hi rend="italic">One</hi>, the letters <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Sixth</hi>, and the words <hi rend="italic">of a</hi> were erased all over the bill; the letter S was pasted to the word <hi rend="italic">Dollar</hi> to make it pass for <hi rend="italic">Dollars</hi>, while on the back of the bill, in the words <hi rend="italic">equal to 9d.

            <p>Some two weeks later it was reported that forged <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> twenty shilling bills, dated August 10, 1739, had lately been discovered. The whole of the bill, with the ornaments, was exceedingly well done, with a pen as it was believed.

            <p>Counterfeit eight dollar <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> bills were also circulating in June.

            <p>Late in 1769 counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills made their appearance.

            <p>On December 16, 1769, a person involved in this counterfeiting was apprehended in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>. The earliest newspaper account of his arrest reads thus:
<q>Last Saturday Night was committed to the Gaol of this City, on Suspicion of counterfeiting Paper Money, a Low-Dutchman, who goes by the Name of <persName>Rosey Grant</persName>; he is about 60 Years old, rather corpulent, about 5 Feet 10 Inches high, says that he was born in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> Government, and that he lived some Time in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5116667">Esopus</placeName>. He was detected by <persName>Robert Taggart</persName>, a Shopkeeper in Market Street, whom he endeavoured to deceive, in the Dusk of the Evening. The Bill not appearing regularly printed, <persName>Mr. Taggart</persName> went and showed it to several Gentlemen, who also doubted the Legality of the Bill; but when he returned to his Shop, the Man was gone, and had left the Goods behind him. <persName>Mr. Taggart</persName> immediately searched after him in several Taverns, and at last found him in one in <placeName>Strawberry Alley</placeName>.

            <p>A new flood of forged bills, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> currency of the denominations of three pounds and of thirty shillings, both dated March 1, 1769, were discovered circulating in July, 1773.

                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> The authorities were justifiably alarmed, and, on July 19, 1773, Lieutenant Governor <persName>Richard Penn</persName> issued a proclamation in which he adverted to the circulation of counterfeits of these two denominations and then continued:</p>
            <p>WHEREAS it is of the greatest Importance to the Trade and Commerce of this Province, that the Credit of all such Bills as have been emitted by Law, should be supported and preserved, and that the Forgers and Counterfeiters of them should be discovered, and brought to condign and exemplary Punishment, I HAVE therefore thought fit, with the Advice of the Council, to issue this Proclamation, hereby promising and engaging, that the public Reward of FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS, shall be paid to any Person or Persons, other than the Accomplices, who shall discover the Author or Authors of the said Forgeries, so that he or they be apprehended and brought to Justice. AND I DO also hereby promise the public Reward of TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS, as well as His Majesty's most gracious Pardon, to any one of the Perpetrators of the said Forgeries, who shall make Discovery of one or more of his Accomplices, so that he or they be prosecuted to Conviction. AND I DO moreover hereby strictly charge, enjoin and require, all Magistrates, Sheriffs, and other Officers, as well as all other His Majesty's liege Subjects within this Province, to exert themselves, and use their utmost Endeavours, to discover and bring to Justice all Offenders in the Premises.<ref target="#CH8-n2">

            <p>At the time that this proclamation appeared the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> authorities already had information as to the identity of the counterfeiters of these bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>. The last week in June two silversmiths, <persName>John Swan</persName> and <persName>Stephen Waterman</persName>, were arrested in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4943909">Middlesex County</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, on suspicion of coining dollars and half joes.

            <p>The information secured by the government of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> was, it seems, imparted to the Grand Jury of the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName> then sitting in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101427">Morristown</placeName>. The jury was told on July 8 that a certain <persName>Josiah Hand</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5098810">Hanover Township</placeName> knew the name of a person who had told him, <persName>Hand</persName>, that he had seen counterfeiting tools in the possession of a person in that neighborhood. Thereupon <persName>Samuel Ogden</persName>, a Justice of the Peace of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, sent a warrant to <persName>Hand</persName>, instructing him to fill in the name of the person who had the knowledge that this person might be brought to court as a witness.<ref target="#CH8-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> and their efforts were crowned with success. Indeed, the Provincial Council subsequently praised the conduct of <persName>Justice Ogden</persName> as that of "a vigilant and upright Magistrate" and expressed the opinion that it was "in a great measure owing to his Activity and

            <p>The leader of this gang was <persName>Samuel Ford</persName>, one of the most resolute and skillful counterfeiters of the entire Colonial Period. <persName>Samuel Ford</persName> was the son of <persName>Samuel Ford, Sr.</persName>, and <persName>Sarah Baldwin</persName>, and the grandson of <persName>John Ford</persName>, who in 1721 settled in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q12894554">Monroe</placeName>, two miles east of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101427">Morristown</placeName>, on a tract of land given to him by <persName>John Budd</persName>, who desired to have the region settled.<ref target="#CH8-n8">

            <p>Not long before 1765 <persName>Ford</persName> was engaged in the iron industry at <placeName>Hibernia</placeName> in company with <persName corresp="#viaf_66768830">Lord Stirling</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Cooper</persName>, a son of <persName>Daniel Cooper</persName> (one of the early judges of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>). The <placeName>Hibernia</placeName> industry, probably in 1764 or 1765, was involved in financial difficulties, and it would seem that <persName>Benjamin Cooper</persName> suggested to <persName>Ford</persName> that he counterfeit money to help them out of their financial problems. At least, in 1773, <persName>Ford</persName> wrote to <persName>Cooper</persName>: "You describe me as being the chiefest promoter and first introducer of the money making affair. Did you not in the time of our depressed circumstances at the furnace first move such a scheme to me?"<ref target="#CH8-n10">

            </p>
            <p>It is not known whether <persName>Ford</persName> at that time acted on his partner's advice. In any event, in 1765, <persName>Ford</persName> sold out his share in the <placeName>Hibernia</placeName> furnace and his property there to <persName>Cooper</persName> and to <persName>James Anderson</persName>, each of whom paid him ¬£265/13/4.<ref target="#CH8-n11">

some means, and with her he returned to <placeName>America</placeName> in 1766. The young lady, of course, then discovered that <persName>Ford</persName> already had a wife and children, so she promptly left him and is said to have married an Irishman and to have resided at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106365">Whippany</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>. It is probable that <persName>Ford</persName> returned early in June, 1766, and that he imported with him counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, for on June 28 the Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> issued a warrant of the treasury to pay the <persName>Honorable John Stevens</persName> to send an express to warn the inhabitants of the province that a large sum of false Jersey bills had just arrived in a vessel from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>.<ref target="#CH8-n12">

            <p>From the confessions made by <persName>Ford</persName>'s accomplices in 1773 it was revealed that he had been in the business of money making for many years and that "in the year 1767, or 8, he followed it in <placeName>New-York</placeName>; but was apprehended on suspicion of making money, and admitted to bail, and even then set about preparing materials to renew the business.‚Ä¶"<ref target="#CH8-n13">

               <persName>Benjamin Cooper</persName>, when examined before <persName>Justices Ogden</persName> and <persName>Tuthill</persName> on September 24, 1773, gave a detailed and probably fairly accurate account of <persName>Ford</persName>'s activities. His story was that sometime in 1767 <persName>Ford</persName> went from <placeName>Hibernia</placeName> to a money maker named <persName>Coon</persName> at <placeName>Stony Hill</placeName>. <persName>Coon</persName> had some false <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> 40/ bills and some <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> 6/ bills with plates for striking them, and it was agreed that <persName>Coon</persName> should send the money and plates to <persName>Ford</persName> by <persName>John Cooper</persName>, <persName>Benjamin</persName>'s brother. <persName>John</persName> brought about ¬£40 of this bogus money to the home of <persName>Thomas Kinney</persName>, Esq., where <persName>Ford</persName> and his associates viewed the currency, decided it was very bad and eventually sent it all back to <persName>Coon</persName> except for a few 6/ notes which <persName>Ford</persName> kept. Early in 1768 <persName>Ford</persName> removed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> and secured counterfeiting materials and studied the technique of making bills. He remained there at the lodging house of a <persName>Mrs. Blaw</persName> until he finally procured a house in "the back Part of the Town." He lived part of the time in this dwelling and part of the time at <persName>Mrs. Blaw</persName>'s.<ref target="#CH8-n14">

            </p>
            <pb n="115"/>
            <p>At some time prior to April 18, 1769, <persName>Ford</persName> had been arrested, for on that day he appeared under recognizance before the Supreme Court in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, at which time his case was put over to the 21, then the 22, the 24, the 27, the 28 and finally the 29, when he appeared "and Proclamation being three times made and no Person appearing to prosecute, On Motion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <persName>Kissam</persName> Ordered that the Defendant be discharged from his Recognizance."<ref target="#CH8-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>He had been making 3/ and 6/ bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> and when he was taken to jail he arranged with his brother-in-law to put away the money and tools, which <persName>Ford</persName> later told <persName>Benjamin Cooper</persName> was done by <persName>Kitchell</persName> or <persName>John Morris</persName>.<ref target="#CH8-n16">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the authorities, probably because of want of sufficient evidence, allowed a most accomplished criminal to slip through their fingers and to ply his nefarious trade unmolested for several years to come. After his difficulty with the law he removed to <placeName>Hanover</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, where he resided on his farm of some one hundred and thirty acres which went by the name of the "<placeName>Hammock</placeName>"<ref target="#CH8-n17">

               </ref> except for the trip to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in 1771, from which he returned in August, 1772.</p>
            <p>More is to be learned about the man named <persName corresp="#_">Morris</persName> from a deposition made on September 24, 1773, by <persName>Bern Budd</persName>. <persName>Budd</persName> claimed that the day before <persName>Ford</persName>'s arrest <persName>Ford</persName> told him that when he lived in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> he learned to carve from a woodcarver and got types from a journeyman printer, a drunken fellow, who lived with <persName corresp="#viaf_26026336">Hugh Gaine</persName>. In the same conversation <persName>Ford</persName> had boasted that he had counterfeited the 30/ and 60/ bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, the ¬£3 bills of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> and numerous notes of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>. He gave up making the ¬£3 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> bills because the paper was so thin that he could not do a good job of imitation.<ref target="#CH8-n19">

<q>Twenty Pounds Reward. Whereas on Friday or Saturday the 28th or 29th of May, came to my house at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101427">Morris Town</placeName>, a man of middle size, aged between 25 and 30 years, of a lively countenance, and streight hair: Had on a brown coat, striped jacket, white breches and stocking, rode a dark bay horse, says his name is <persName>Reddon</persName>, or <persName>Redmon</persName>, and that he came from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, with whom I chang'd a Ten Pound York bill (of the latest emission of that currency) for twenty-five dollars; the bill was marked on the back H. in one of the corners. The dollars since prove to be counterfeit, of which he had many more with him, and it is supposed will offer them to change for paper money. He enquired the road to <placeName>Goshen</placeName> and it is likely is gone that way. If any person or persons will apprehend and secure him in any of his Majesty's goals, so that he may be brought to condign punishment, he shall receive the above reward of Twenty Pounds, by me.</q>

            <p>It seems, however, that <persName>Kinney</persName> himself had been largely to blame for <persName>Ford</persName>'s escape. <persName>John King</persName>, formerly undersheriff of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName> and apparently no friend of <persName>Kinney</persName>, wrote after his flight to <persName corresp="#viaf_56609913">Governor Franklin</persName>, laying charges against the high sheriff in respect to <persName>Ford</persName>'s breaking jail. <persName>Kinney</persName> was given an opportunity to reply thereto, and the Provincial Council, after a careful study of all the evidence, reached the conclusion that <persName>Kinney</persName> was "blameable for negligence in his Office respecting the Escape of <persName>Samuel Ford</persName>."

            <p>A letter, dated <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101427">Morristown</placeName>, Aug. 30, 1773, and sent to <persName>James Rivington</persName>, gave the story of the trial conducted at the special Court of Oyer and Terminer. It ran as follows:
<q>This account you would have had sooner, but it was thought (for certain reasons) prudent not to publish it until this time.</q>
               <q>You have already mentioned in your paper that <persName>Samuel Ford</persName> and <persName>John King</persName> had escaped from goal. Their escape made it extremely difficult to discover their accomplices. The Court opened on Tuesday the 11th, and it was the Friday following before the least intimation could be got of any person concerned, when one of them, who lay under the <hi rend="italic">censure</hi> of three convictions, the one for aiding <persName>Ford</persName> and <persName>King</persName> in their escape, and the others for high misdemeanors, on being hard pushed, and in order to mitigate his punishment for these crimes, began to make a confession, this soon alarmed another of the accomplices, who made an ample and full confession.</q>
               <q>By which confessions, and those of the persons afterwards apprehended, these facts appeared ‚Äî That <persName>Ford</persName> had been in the business of money making many years, that in the year 1767, or 8, he followed it in <placeName>New-York</placeName>; but was apprehended on a suspicion of making money, and admitted to bail, and even then set about preparing materials to renew the business, that he soon removed back into this county, where he again entered into it, and made a connection in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, with a certain <persName>Captain Joseph Richardson</persName>, from whom he got a supply of types, he then attempted the <placeName>New-York</placeName> emission of Three Pound Bills, and made a considerable sum, but complained of the thinness of the paper, and the bad credit of the currency; at least in this and the neighbouring provinces, and gave a preference to the Jersey currency; but it is thought did little at it till the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> emission of 1769 came out, when he with <persName>Captain Richardson</persName>
                  <pb n="120"/>
went to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, and from thence to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> and the manufactoring towns, and <persName>Ford</persName> applied himself to learn the business of an engraver and type maker, and from his knowledge before in the art of carving, and an uncommon natural genius, he in the course of three months became so perfect a master of the business, that (on his return to <placeName>America</placeName>) he made all the types for his press, and in so masterly a manner, that the imitation of the Jersey and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills, which were struck by them of Three Pounds, and Thirty Shillings is so exact that the difference cannot be discovered without the most strict examination of a person well acquainted with the true bills.</q>
               <q>From the time of his return, till he was apprehended, he went on with uninterrupted success, and emitted large sums of the Jersey and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> currency; but principally of the latter, for these two years past, and was the less apprehensive of being detected for the following reasons:</q>
               <q>1st. His bills had stood the test of several treasurers examination, and had had their sanction, which he ever made an invariable rule to secure before he passed any of his new emissions.</q>
               <q>2dly. His press and all his implements were in an almost impenetrable swamp, at a mile distance from his house, and in which the water, most part of the year, was half leg deep, so that no person could track him, and he must <hi rend="italic">crawl</hi> on his belly some rods before he could reach it.</q>
               <q>3dly. As no person, except <persName>King</persName> and <persName>Richardson</persName>, knew where he did work, or had ever seen the place, and these, and all others concerned, were sworn to secrecy. ‚Äî He used to go to his work at day light, in the morning, with his gun, so that no person could suspect him. <persName>Ford</persName> was called the <hi rend="italic">Treasurer for the three provinces</hi>. He signed his own bills. By direction of the Court a number of persons went into the swamp, in search of his types, &amp;c. but found only his press, and a leather that covered the bills when they were struck, on which was the impression of a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Bill of ¬£3, of the emission of 1769.</q>
               <q>Upon these facts the following persons (who were only concerned as passers of the money, except <persName>Reynolds</persName>, who procured some types for <persName>Ford</persName>) to wit, <persName>Benjamin Cooper</persName>, Esq; <persName>Doctor Bern Budd</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_29879814">Samuel Haynes</persName> and <persName>David Reynolds</persName>, were indicted and plead guilty to their several indictments, and on the nineteenth they received sentence of death, to be executed the 17th of September next. Few scenes ever were more truly affecting than the one in the court-house, at the time of sentence passing.

‚Äî These four persons are remarkably handsome fine looking men, three of them about thirty, the other 40, they are all married and have children. All are descendants from the first families in the province, and all have parents living, and numerous relations ‚Äî the attendance of their relations and friends added much to the solemnity of it, so much that it is better conceived than described ‚Äî among a thousand people there was scarce a dry eye. The spectators were more sensible affected for those unhappy persons, as it appeared they had been drawn into it by the art, cunning and perswasion of that <persName>VILLAIN FORD</persName>.</q>
               <q>These were all the persons apprehended for capital crimes, except justice <persName>Ayres</persName>, whose crime was committed in Sussex county, it appeared he had not been in the practice for some time past, and if any judgement can be formed of his repentance, by his conduct and carriage, it was sincere before he was suspected, as his life had lately been so exemplary, that the congregation to which he belonged had promoted him to the rank of deacon, and the parson was so fully convinced of his innocence, that on the Sunday after his committment he PRAYED for his protection from <hi rend="italic">false accusers</hi>, and the Sunday following a report prevailed that he was released, when the Parson returned thanks for it; but alas! before the next Sunday certain accounts were received that he had confessed his crime.</q>
               <q>During these enquiries, sufficient evidence appeared to convince every one present, that <persName>Ford</persName> was one of the Persons that robbed the Treasury of this Province some years since, both, from his own confession to one of the convicts, who declared it on oath, as also from many other circumstance.</q>
               <q>From this account of <persName>Ford</persName>, the Public must view him in the light of the most accomplished <hi rend="italic">Villain</hi>, that this country ever produced, and it is hoped it will stimulate every well-wisher to the community throughout the continent, to be watchfull for, and active in apprehending him, especially when they have the promise of 500 l. from the Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, for convicting the Person who counterfeited the Currency of that Province, and of his being the man, against whom there is the fullest Proof. ‚Äî It is supposed he is gone to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4401696">Ohio</placeName>, and intends going down to the mouth of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1497">Mississippi</placeName>, <persName>Richardson</persName> has also made his escape.</q>
               <q>The Grand Jury in a polite Address, thanked the Court and Attorney General for the great Pains they had taken, in aiding them in their discoveries, and in a very particular manner gave their thanks; and those

               <q>You should have had this at large with the answer to it, but too much of your Paper would be taken up thereby, for one subject to ingross.</q>

            <p>The pursuit of <persName>Ford</persName> occupied considerable space in the newspapers for some time. On September 9, 1773, <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Rivington</persName>'s <placeName>New-York</placeName> Gazetteer</hi> reported: "By a letter from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName>, dated the 6th instant, we have certain intelligence that <persName>Ford</persName> the money-maker, was a few days past on the West branch of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q27538">Susquehanna</placeName>, where a number of persons, from all quarters are gone in pursuit of him, so that the much injured public may now expect this most dangerous man will be apprehended, and exemplarily punished, a circumstance most ardently wished, as it may possibly lead to an extension of mercy in favour of several persons who have been unhappily, through his immediate means brought into the most shocking and desperate circumstances."</p>
            <p>New light on the affair was shed by the following account published a week later in the same newspaper:
<q>On the 3d instant a further and very strict search was made for printing materials (concealed by <persName>Ford</persName>, the money maker) in the swamp where the press was found,<ref target="#CH8-n27">
                     <hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                  </ref> when, after much diligence exerted, a set of plates for printing the currencies of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName>, and <placeName>New-York</placeName>, with a quantity of types and other utensils for carrying on the counterfeiting bills of each province, were discovered and secured. In the course of his flight he put off some Jersey bills of his own manufacture amongst the Indians, who being afterwards apprized that they were counterfeited, very chearfully joined in the pursuit of this most pernicious artist.</q>

            <pb n="123"/>
            <p>Eventually <persName>Sheriff Kinney</persName> located in the woods near the place where <persName>Ford</persName>'s printing utensils had been found thirty-six counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> thirty shilling bills and part of a three pound bill, all supposed to be <persName>Ford</persName>'s work. <persName>Kinney</persName> sent them to the governor, who on February 8, 1775, laid the bills before the Provincial Council. That body ordered that they be committed to the care of the deputy secretary to be kept with the types and counterfeiting implements discovered in 1773 and already committed to his care.<ref target="#CH8-n28">

            <p>On September 13, 1773, <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Rivington</persName>'s <placeName>New-York</placeName> Gazetteer</hi> informed its readers of the fugitives: "Positive accounts are received that <persName>Ford</persName> and <persName>King</persName> were at <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q5470761">Fort Augusta</placeName>, near <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q27538">Susquehannah</placeName>, on the 29th of August, he was hovering in a canoe on one of the branches of that river, so he is not very likely to escape.</p>
            <p>"We are just now informed that <persName>Ford</persName> and <persName>King</persName> were on the 5th instant at a village called <placeName>Annaquauga</placeName>, and the chasseurs expected to be up with them the next night."</p>
            <p>Despite the rumors concerning the flight of <persName>Ford</persName> he was all the time at Smultz's Cabin, and news of this seems to have forced <persName>Sheriff Kinney</persName> to act, for about mid-September, on a Sunday morning, he went with a posse to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5103396">Rockaway</placeName>, where he picked up <persName>Abraham Kitchell</persName>, <persName>Ford</persName>'s brother-in-law as a guide, and proceeded in a leisurely fashion towards Smultz's Cabin. <persName>Young James Kitchell</persName>, <persName>Abraham</persName>'s son, told one <persName>Joseph Herriman</persName> what was up, and <persName>Herriman</persName>, throwing off his coat, ran off along a short cut to the cabin and warned <persName>Ford</persName>, so that, when the sheriff arrived, it was too late and <persName>Ford</persName> had decamped. It was rumored that <persName>Kinney</persName> himself had been involved with <persName>Ford</persName> and had purposely tarried. It was related that <persName>Abraham Kitchell</persName> had that Sunday remarked to the sheriff: "You dare not, for your own sake, arrest him."<ref target="#CH8-n30">

                  <persName>Rivington</persName>'s <placeName>New-York</placeName> Gazetteer</hi>, on September 23, devoted space to the latest developments:
<q>Last Friday between ten and twelve o'clock, was executed at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101427">Morris Town</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q845760">East-Jersey</placeName>, <persName>David Reynolds</persName>, who was convicted of counterfeiting and passing of base money; he died very penitent. <persName>Cooper Budd</persName> and <persName>Haines</persName>, condemned with him, are respited to the 15th of October. The public shall shortly be made acquainted with many interesting and authentic particulars relative to this dangerous confederacy. The last accounts of <persName>Ford</persName>, the most heinous of this destructive community, are, that he was seen asleep under a tree, guarded by <persName>King</persName>, and another man well armed; they take their rest alternately in this manner. <persName>Ford</persName> is reduced by a fever, joined to a complication of the most loathsome distempers, which prevent his travelling now any more than five miles a day, and as there are some very determined people engaged in the pursuit, it is expected he is ere now either found dead or taken alive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reason for the respiting of <persName>Cooper</persName>, <persName>Budd</persName> and <persName>Haines</persName> is probably found in this extract from a letter from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5102578">Perth Amboy</placeName>, dated September 15 and printed in the <hi rend="italic">New-York Journal</hi>; <hi rend="italic">or, the General Advertiser</hi> of September 23, 1773: "The Wives and Relations of most of the unhappy Money Makers, now under Sentence of Death, are here with the Governor, in Order to solicit him for a Reprieve.

            <p>The <hi rend="italic">New-York Gazette</hi>; <hi rend="italic">and the Weekly Mercury</hi> of September 27, 1773, thus recounted the execution of <persName>Reynolds</persName> in the presence of an estimated 15,000 spectators,<ref target="#CH8-n31">

Scheme of making and passing counterfeit Money; after the Execution of <persName>Rosecrans</persName>, <persName>Reynolds</persName> accidentally met with <persName>Capt. Richardson</persName> (of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, who is fled) and getting acquainted with each other's Characters, was by him introduced to <persName>Ford</persName>, <persName>Haynes</persName>, <persName>Cooper</persName>, <persName>Budd</persName>, <persName>King</persName>, and the rest of the <persName>Gang. Ford</persName> the Principal, termed by the Rest, the Treasurer of the three Provinces, had counterfeited the Money Bills of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, in so Masterly a manner as not to be distinguished from the true Bills without the nicest Inspection, and also several of the Gold and Silver Coins current in the British Colonies; and in passing these, <persName>Reynolds</persName> and the Rest of the Accomplices continued, till <persName>Ford</persName> and <persName>King</persName> were apprehended and imprisoned in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName> Gaol, from whence they soon after made their escape, as mentioned in the Papers. One of the Gang being convicted of aiding them in their Escape and other high Misdemeanors, to mitigate his Punishment, made some Confessions tending to the Discovery of the <persName>Rest</persName>, which alarmed another, who made an ample confession of the whole, in Consequence of which <persName>Reynolds</persName>, <persName>Haynes</persName>, <persName>Cooper</persName>, and <persName>Budd</persName>, were tried, confessed their Guilt, and were condemned to be hanged. Their Execution was ordered to be on the 17th Instant; before the Time, <persName>Budd</persName> and <persName>Haynes</persName> were respited for a Month, but <persName>Reynolds</persName> and <persName>Cooper</persName> were ordered to prepare for Execution at the Time appointed. A few Minutes before the Time, <persName>Cooper</persName> confessed himself privy to the Robbery of the Treasury at <placeName>Amboy</placeName>, and that he received Three Hundred Pounds of the Money; on which he also was respited till he should make further Discoveries. <persName>Reynolds</persName> was therefore ordered for Execution alone‚Ä¶</q>
               <q>
                  <persName>Cooper</persName> confessed that he was privy to the robbery of the Treasury at <placeName>Amboy</placeName>, and received 300 l. of the Money, that it was concerted by <persName>Ford</persName> and perpetrated by him and three Soldiers then quartered there; that the plan was, first to attempt to carry off the Iron Chest, if that fail'd, next to take the Key from <persName>Mr. Skinner</persName>'s Bedroom, and to kill him or any Person who should discover them; and that if afterwards any of them should be suspected and convicted, they were to turn <persName>King</persName>'s Evidence and accuse <persName>Mr. Skinner</persName> as being the only Accomplice with them. When some of them were shocked at this Proposal as thereby an innocent Person might lose his Life; <persName>Ford</persName> replied, <hi rend="italic">no, damn him, he will only be condemned, he has Friends enough to save him from the Gallows</hi>. That after breaking into the Treasure's Office adjoining to his Bed Room, they attempted to carry off
<pb n="126"/>
the Chest, but finding it difficult, set it down again, and breaking open a Desk in the Room, in hopes to find Money, they therein found an old Key to the Money Chest, which was rusty and thought unfit for Use (the Key then used being in <persName>Mr. Skinner</persName>'s Bed Room) with this old Key, they opened the Iron Chest, and thereby the Lives that would been exposed by their Search for the other Key, were probably preserv'd.

He was well armed, as was also a man that attended him, who, soon as day dawned, took his station before the house, watching narrowly every person who passed, until they departed. On <persName>Richardson</persName>'s going off, being asked if he was not afraid of being taken, he replied, no; damn me! A man whose pockets are lined with money, and his heart with courage, has nothing to fear but God; and before I am heard of again in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, I shall be out of the reach of pursuit.'"</q>

               <persName corresp="#viaf_56609913">Governor Franklin</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, in the light of the recent events, on November 12, 1773, addressed the General Assembly of the province with these words:
<q>A Discovery was made some time in the beginning of the last summer of a number of persons in the counties of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4943909">Middlesex</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101305">Monmouth</placeName>, concerned in making a base kind of Half Johannes, and Spanish Dollars, which happily led to the discovery of another gang of villains in the counties of <persName corresp="#_">Morris</persName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4144895">Sussex</placeName>, who had for several years past been employed in counterfeiting and passing the paper currency of this and the neighbouring colonies. From the confessions of some of them, corroborated by many striking circumstances, the affair of the robbery of the treasury, which had remained so long enveloped in darkness, has likewise been brought to light. Unluckily some of each gang have made their escape out of the province; but all of the former who were apprehended, and one of the chief of the latter have received that punishment for their crimes which the law would permit; three others, who were sentenced to death, have been respited, for very particular reasons, as you will see by the papers I shall order to be laid before you. No endeavours have been, or shall be wanting on my part, to have those who escaped, apprehended and brought to justice.</q>
               <q>As the Mischief in which these persons were engaged is of such extensive and pernicious a nature, I cannot but congratulate you upon the stop which has been put to its further progress: Nor can I doubt but you will think with me, that the thanks and grateful acknowledgements of the public are due to those Gentlemen who have with great zeal and abilities, and with considerable trouble and expence, been the means of detecting and apprehending the authors of it.</q>
               <q>On this occasion I think it proper to recommend to you the passing of a Law to make it a felony to counterfeit in this province the silver and gold coin of foreign countries. Many of them have now so general a circulation here, that the mischiefs resulting from their being counterfeited may be as destructive as the counterfeiting of our own paper currency.<ref target="#CH8-n39">

            <p>Five days later <persName corresp="#viaf_56609913">Governor Franklin</persName> followed his speech with a proclamation offering a reward of ¬£300 for the apprehension of <persName>Ford</persName>, a like sum for the capture of <persName>Richardson</persName>, and of ¬£50 for the taking of <persName>John King</persName>. <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Rivington</persName>'s <placeName>New-York</placeName> Gazetteer</hi> of December 16, 1773, which carried the proclamation, pointed out that the total of rewards for the three counterfeiters was ¬£750 for <persName>Ford</persName>, ¬£600 for <persName>Richardson</persName> and ¬£75 for <persName>King</persName>. The newspaper added that it was suspected that <persName>Ford</persName> would use the alias of <persName>Samuel Samson</persName> and <persName>King</persName> that of <persName>John Horton</persName>.</p>
            <p>The same newspaper on January 20, 1774, was still hopeful that <persName>Ford</persName> and <persName>King</persName> would be taken. "The pursuit of <persName>Ford</persName> and <persName>King</persName> the money-makers," wrote its printer, "has, ever since their escape from justice, been unremitted; and though it has not hitherto proved successful, yet there still remains great encouragement to expect they will be taken, ‚Äì ‚Äì an event that must reconcile every one to the pardon which has been lately vouchsafed to the three persons set at liberty from confinement at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101427">Morris Town</placeName>; and it is hoped a few weeks will enable us to pronounce these adventurers to be in safe custody."</p>
            <p>It turned out that <persName>Ford</persName> had left many creditors behind him, and the Inferior Court of Common Pleas of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName> on or before October 30 appointed <persName>Samuel Tuthill</persName> and <persName>Jonathan Styles</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101427">Morristown</placeName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_317273912">Thomas Millidge</persName> of <placeName>Hanover</placeName> to adjust and to settle the demands of his creditors.<ref target="#CH8-n40">

            <p>In 1763 <persName>Joseph Billings</persName> had been in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5207728">Reading</placeName> jail for counterfeiting, and it was reported that he had had to leave <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> for the like crime, had been whipped out of a regiment at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5206379">Pittsburg</placeName> for coining dollars, and had been imprisoned in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> for similar wickedness. <persName>Herman Rosencrans</persName> and <persName>Billings</persName> were acquainted as early as 1762, when, as <persName>Rosencrans</persName> claimed, he had sold a horse to <persName>Billings</persName> and received counterfeit bills for it.<ref target="#CH9-n1">

On January 15, 1770, <persName corresp="#viaf_18693541">Lieutenant Governor John Penn</persName> issued the following proclamation:

            <p>At the end of October, 1770, one <persName>Josiah Pitt</persName> was indicted at the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5220355">York County</placeName> for altering a two shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bill of credit to ten shillings and for passing the altered note.

            <p>A warning was printed in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of November 29, 1770, that counterfeit half Johannes, dated 1746 and made of base metal thinly gilded over, were circulating. They were somewhat broader, thicker and lighter than the true ones. If they were compared with the genuine coins, they might readily be detected, since the letters of the counterfeits were not so regular nor the workmanship so well executed.</p>
            <p>A few days later a notice was printed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> that counterfeit English guineas were passing in the city.

            <p>A dispatch from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName>, dated February 3, 1772, was published in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> ten days later.

the Counterfeits, and scarcely to be observed in the true Ones; the Coat of Arms is very remarkable in the Plainness of the Supporters. ‚Äì ‚Äì In the Word THREE in the Counterfeits, under the Sun, the two EE's are shorter than the Rest of the Word. ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì In the true Bills, on the right <persName>Hand</persName> Border, are two remarkable black Spots, near the upper and lower End, which are wanting in the Counterfeits: The Signers Names are wrote well, and rather better than the true Ones."<ref target="#CH9-n8">

            <p>The same month, February, 1772, false milled dollars, dated 1770 and made of base metal, were circulating. They were supposed to be cast and apparently rather well done. When compared with genuine ones, the counterfeits looked darker, felt smoother and were nearly five pennyweight too light.<ref target="#CH9-n9">

            <p>At the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5220355">York County</placeName> held the last week in April, 1772, one <persName>David Robinson</persName> was indicted for passing one ninth of a dollar of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> currency altered in its denomination to six dollars. He pleaded not guilty but was tried, convicted and given the comparatively light sentence of paying a fine of ¬£10 to the governor and costs of prosecution and suffering three months of imprisonment.<ref target="#CH9-n10">

            </p>
            <p>It seems likely that <persName>Robinson</persName> was one of a gang or at least the accomplice of some other counterfeiter, for altered <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> bills continued to appear. <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Chronicle, and Universal Advertiser</hi> of June 15, 1772, printed this notice: "Within a few Days past several Persons in this City have been greatly imposed on in receiving <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">MARYLAND</placeName> PAPER MONEY BILLS, many of which are altered by some Villain or Villains, from a small to a higher Value; Circumspection is therefore necessary. ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì Some of the Bills are altered from <hi rend="italic">One Dollar</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Six</hi>, and others from <hi rend="italic">Two-ninths of a Dollar</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">Four Dollars</hi>."<ref target="#CH9-n11">

            <p>On July 2 the public was cautioned against counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>

thirty shilling bills dated April 16, 1764, and signed <persName>John Johnston</persName>, <persName>Rich</persName>
               <hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <persName>Smith</persName>, and <persName>S. Smith</persName>, but so unlike the signing in the true bills as to be easily detected. The impression was of a remarkably blackish appearance, the word <hi rend="italic">New-Jersey</hi> on the left border was much plainer, as also the flourishing on the top and right edge, and very different from the true bills. They bore the printer's signature, G, but it was possible that some might carry another signature, especially after this warning.<ref target="#CH9-n12">

            <p>The same month other forged bills, twenty shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> notes, dated May 1, 1760, appeared in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>.

            <p>Two other types of counterfeited <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills were mentioned in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of August 19, 1772: one variety was of ten shilling notes, dated April 3, 1772, which were easy to detect, as there were no true ones of that date printed; the other counterfeits were two shilling bills altered to ten. These were well done but the fraud could easily be discovered, since the form of the two shilling bill was very different from that of any ten shilling bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>. The same newspaper on September 9 warned that counterfeit eighteen penny bills of the Bettering-house money had appeared; they were done from a copperplate and could readily be detected, as the letters were very irregularly cut and did not look as clear as those made with common printing types. At the same time people were cautioned to beware of one shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills altered to ten by the pasting of the word <hi rend="italic">Ten</hi> over <hi rend="italic">One</hi>, but so badly done that they might easily be recognized. It is likely that one of those concerned in altering the bills was <persName>John Underwood</persName>, who at a Mayor's Court held in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> at the end of October, 1772, was convicted of counterfeiting and passing counterfeit money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> and

sentenced to be whipped, to stand in the pillory, and to have both ears cut off and nailed to the post.<ref target="#CH9-n14">
                  <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
               </ref> The nature of the sentence shows that his crime was altering money and passing it.</p>
            <p>Early in June forged <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> dollar bills, dated March 1, 1770 and badly cut on copperplate, were passing. The letters on the face and back stood very irregular, and the bills on the whole were so poorly executed that one acquainted with printing letters could scarcely be deceived by them.<ref target="#CH9-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref> The persons concerned in passing them may have been the individuals referred to in the following item in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Chronicle, and Universal Advertiser</hi> of Monday, June 21, 1773: "Last Tuesday was committed to our Gaol, two Men taken up at <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q38249656">Potts-Grove</placeName>, for attempting to utter a counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> Eight Dollar Bill, and on searching, there were found on them eighty of those Bills." The same account was printed by <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of June 23, 1773, which, however, added:
<q>These Men were but just arrived from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, and since their Commitment, their Chests were searched on board the Ship that brought them, when 874 more of the same Bills were found therein.</q>
               <q>The above Counterfeits are dated March 1, 1770; the Face of the Bill is done with Printing Types, but the Arms and Ornaments are badly engraved on Copperplate, and the Words, Anno Domini, in Old English Print, are larger in the Counterfeit than in the true Bills; the Paper is thinner, and the Backs are so ill engraved, that they might easily be detected, should any have been passed by them before they were taken up.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One of these two men, <persName>Kelly</persName> by name, died early in July of a fever in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> jail, and by the middle of the month his associate was so desperately ill that his death also was expected,<ref target="#CH9-n16">
                  <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
               </ref> and it is probable that he escaped death on the gallows in the same manner as <persName>Kelly</persName> had done.</p>
            <p>Aside from the activities of <persName>Samuel Ford</persName> and his accomplices,
<pb n="139"/>
which are discussed in a separate chapter, the only further case of counterfeiting in 1773 was that of <persName>Thomas Collen</persName>, who was indicted at a Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5205788">Philadelphia County</placeName> in September for "forging &amp; counterfeiting 8 Dollars Bills." He was tried, found not guilty and discharged on payment of the costs of prosecution.<ref target="#CH9-n17">

            <p>The activities of the <persName>Ford Gang</persName> and a particularly successful forging of the currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> contributed to the enactment of new legislation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>. At the end of September a law was passed setting the death penalty without benefit of clergy for anyone convicted of counterfeiting or passing paper money so counterfeited of any British colony in <placeName>America</placeName>. The penalty for altering or passing altered currency of any British colony in <placeName>America</placeName> was the following: to stand in the pillory, to have both ears cut off and nailed to the pillory, to receive thirty-nine lashes, to pay a fine of ¬£100, one half to the governor and one half to the informer, to pay double damages to the person injured and to pay the costs of prosecution. If the culprit did not have the means to pay the monetary penalties, he or she might be sold for a term up to seven years to satisfy such payments.<ref target="#CH9-n18">
                  <hi rend="sup">18</hi>
               </ref> And on November 6, 1773, the Assembly of <placeName>New Castle</placeName>, <placeName>Kent</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4144895">Sussex</placeName> passed and sent up to the governor, who enacted it into law, a similar act "to prevent the Counterfeiting the Paper Money of other Colonies."<ref target="#CH9-n19">

            <p>Early in 1774 counterfeit one shilling bills of the Bettering-house money, dated March 10, 1769, and done with printing types, appeared. The letters were not clear and looked blacker and the impression was stronger than was the case with the true bills.

            <p>The execution of <persName>Repton</persName> did not restrain others, for in October, 1774, false twenty shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills, dated March 20, 1771, were found in circulation.

He broke out of the public jail of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5205788">Philadelphia County</placeName>, and on May 27 <persName corresp="#viaf_18693541">Lieutenant Governor John Penn</persName> issued a proclamation offering a reward of ¬£200 for his capture and delivery to the Sheriff of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5205788">Philadelphia County</placeName>. <persName>McAllister</persName> was described as "a young man, about eighteen or nineteen years of age, five feet eight or nine inches high, round shouldered, bow legged, a little pitted with the small pox," who wore his own hair. He had been found guilty of uttering and passing counterfeit bills of credit of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, knowing them to be such.<ref target="#CH9-n26">

            <p>Within about ten days, <persName>McAllister</persName>'s accomplice, <persName>Andrew Stewart</persName>, under sentence of death "for Counterfeiting and uttering Fifty Shilling Bills of the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>," had also made his escape from the jail, and in <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of June 7, 1775, <persName>Sheriff William Dewes</persName> had a notice printed offering a reward of ¬£250 for his capture.</p>
            <p>Shortly before the outbreak of the Revolution a plan to counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills was hatched abroad. <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Gazette</hi> (Pinkney) of June 1, 1775, printed on its first page the copy of a letter signed Britannophilus and sent from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName> to <persName corresp="#viaf_62815192">John Wilkes</persName>, Lord Mayor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName>. The mayor had given a copy of it to <persName>Arthur Lee</persName>, who, apparently, on March 22, 1775, sent it off from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> to <placeName>America</placeName>. It read in part:
<pb n="142"/>
               <q>I live in a great city in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>. Some weeks ago a printer came to me, and shewed me two bank notes [i.e. bills of credit] (not knowing the language, nor the contents) which two foreigners brought to him, to re-print them exactly: I found the one to be a bank note of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347242">Annapolis</placeName>, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName>, and the other of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, of 50 and of 5 shillings, both of 1774. I was surprized, and told the printer he should not at all meddle with the rascals who brought these papers. Afterwards I heard that they have been at two engravers, to get two others counterfeited, and they refused likewise. But as I do not doubt they will find out, in another town, some ignorant or hungry engraver, or printer, I beg your lordship to communicate these contents of my letter to the public, in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> Chronicle</hi>, to prevent any mischief and imposition on the honest Americans, vexed not only by taxes, but also by bad bank notes. It will give me great pleasure to read in this paper my notice, to frustrate the designs of these impostors.</q>

            <p>On Monday, January 1, 1776, <persName>Zachariah Smith Allen</persName>, a cordwainer, was detected in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> passing counterfeit three pound <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills of the emission of March, 1769, signed with the names of <persName>Richard Smith</persName>, <persName>John Johnson</persName> and <persName>Stephen Skinner</persName>. An indictment was filed against him on January 19, 1776, for having, on December 28, 1775, in the <placeName>East Ward</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> passed a false three pound <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bill to <persName>William Thorn</persName>, and the witnesses against him were <persName>Thorn</persName>, <persName>Charles Brannon</persName> and <persName>John King</persName>. The same day a second indictment was filed against him in the Supreme Court of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> for having, on December 26, 1775, in the <placeName>North Ward</placeName> of the city, passed a false three pound <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bill to <persName>Margaret</persName>, the wife of <persName>James Gordon</persName>, and in this case the witnesses were <persName>Margaret Gordon</persName> and <persName>Charles Brannon</persName> (or <persName>Brennon</persName>). <persName>Allen</persName> was arraigned on January 19, 1776, and pleaded not guilty, but there is no record of his having been tried. After his arrest a search of his lodgings revealed thirty-two ¬£3 bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> and about ¬£70 worth of goods, which he had presumably purchased with his counterfeits.<ref target="#CH9-n27">

As a result, most of the cases of counterfeiting connected with the three lower counties were reported in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_5191024">Germantown</placeName> newspapers and steps were frequently taken by the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> authorities to apprehend the guilty parties. In the earlier chapters of this book many incidents concerned with <placeName>New Castle</placeName>, <placeName>Kent</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4144895">Sussex</placeName> have been discussed: in 1724 <persName>William Sinton</persName>, jailed in <placeName>New Castle</placeName> for forging the paper currency, broke out and escaped; <persName corresp="#viaf_6469121">Governor Patrick Gordon</persName> in 1727 first discovered at <placeName>New Castle</placeName> the counterfeiting of <persName>Wallace</persName> and <persName>Willson</persName>; it was upon information supplied by a person in <placeName>New Castle</placeName> that a coiner, <persName>Zachariah Field</persName>, in 1730 was pursued by a hue and cry from the lower counties and was taken and punished; in 1734 <persName>Conway</persName> and <persName>Sherwin</persName>, who had been passing counterfeit ten, twenty, and probably also fifteen shilling <placeName>New Castle</placeName> bills, were discovered by <persName>Richard Grafton</persName>, who went from <placeName>New Castle</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4950065">Salem</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, for that purpose,<ref target="#CH10-n1">

tion, and bills of the same denomination were counterfeited again in 1748; in 1753 and again in 1756 the ten shilling <placeName>New Castle</placeName> bills were forged, and in 1761 two shilling <placeName>New Castle</placeName> bills altered to ten shillings made their appearance.<ref target="#CH10-n2">

            <p>Unfortunately the court records of <placeName>New Castle</placeName> County are only partially preserved and those which have survived yield no information on cases of counterfeiting, though coiners and counterfeiters certainly came before the courts in <placeName>New Castle</placeName>, as is shown by the incidents mentioned above and by the following item printed in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> Gazette</hi> of October 25, 1749: "We hear that a Man is in Gaol at <hi rend="italic">Newcastle</hi>, for counterfeiting some of the Bills of Credit of this Province; and that the Plate, and some unsigned Bills, were found upon him: But they are so very ill done, and so unlike the true Bills, that the Fraud may be easily discovered."</p>
            <p>The court records of the other two counties, however, contribute somewhat to our knowledge of colonial counterfeiting. At the May, 1745, term of the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4144895">Sussex County</placeName>, <persName>Garret Condon</persName> was presented for uttering false and counterfeit money. It was ordered that the presentment "be put in Bill of form and process to issue." The case was continued to the August and November sessions. <persName>Condon</persName> was released on bail, for at the February, 1746, term of the court "<persName>John Worthington</persName> the Surety in this Case brings in the body of the s<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Garret." The prisoner was then committed to jail and the court ruled that he be allowed three shillings a week until his trial, which was to be continued to the Court of Oyer and Terminer.<ref target="#CH10-n3">

            <p>The Grand Jury at the August, 1755, term of the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4143221">Kent County</placeName>, presented two men for passing <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> currency supposed to be counterfeit. One of them, <persName>Isaac Gray</persName>, was committed for want of security. The other, <persName>William Smith</persName>, provided

bail, himself in the amount of ¬£500 and three others, <persName>Benony</persName> and <persName>William Watson</persName> and <persName>Richard Smith</persName>, each in the amount of ¬£250. <persName>Smith</persName>'s case was continued from term to term until the May, 1756, sessions. When, at that time, no person appeared to prosecute him, he was discharged by proclamation on payment of fees. <persName>Gray</persName>, however, remained in jail, and his case was continued until at the August, 1756, term it was recorded in the minutes that he "Broke Gaol &amp; Run away."<ref target="#CH10-n4">

            <p>At the May, 1764, term of the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4143221">Kent County</placeName>
               <persName>James Wells, Jr.</persName>, was indicted for uttering one false dollar. A subpoena was issued for <persName>Thomas Murphy</persName>, a blacksmith, and <persName>Stephen Davis</persName> to appear to testify against him at the August sessions of the court. <persName>Wells</persName> pleaded not guilty and was released on bail, himself in the amount of ¬£500 and <persName>Henry Wells</persName> in the like amount. In August the case was continued and <persName>Wells</persName> was again released on bail, himself in the amount of ¬£500 and <persName>Daniel Wright Newnan</persName> (or <persName>Newman</persName>) in the like amount. <persName>Murphy</persName> and <persName>Davis</persName> each were required to furnish bail in the amount of ¬£50 for their appearance to testify. The case was continued to November, when bail for <persName>Wells</persName>' appearance was provided by <persName>Murphy</persName> and <persName>Newnan</persName>. In February, 1765, the case was again continued, and <persName>Wells</persName> was committed to the sheriff for want of bail. Henceforth the case was continued from term to term until in May, 1769, it disappeared from the court docket.<ref target="#CH10-n5">

            <p>One <persName>Philip McGaugy</persName> was twice indicted at the May, 1767, term of the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4143221">Kent County</placeName>, on each count for passing a counterfeit dollar. A subpoena was issued for <persName>Fenwick Fisher</persName>, Esq., <persName>Richard Lee</persName> and <persName>Alexander Munroe</persName> to testify for the <persName>King</persName> at the next sessions. The prisoner pleaded not guilty, and <persName>George Read</persName> prosecuted for the <persName>King</persName>. At the August term <persName>McGaugy</persName> changed his plea on each count to guilty; on the first count he was fined ¬£5, required to pay fees and to give security for his good behavior for twelve months; on the second count he was sentenced to pay ¬£5 and costs.<ref target="#CH10-n6">

            </p>
            <p>At the same time that <persName>McGaugy</persName> was indicted, in May, 1767, one <persName>Barnet</persName> (or <persName>Barnett</persName>) <persName>Ripton</persName> was presented by the Grand Jury at the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4143221">Kent County</placeName> for counterfeiting and passing dollars. <persName>Fisher</persName>, <persName>Lee</persName> and <persName>Munroe</persName> also were the witnesses against him. <persName>Ripton</persName> pleaded not guilty. At the August, 1767, term of the court he was tried, convicted and sentenced to stand one hour in the pillory, to receive thirty-nine lashes on the bare back, and to provide security in the amount of ¬£50 for his good behavior for twelve months.<ref target="#CH10-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> His sentence was doubtless so much severer than that of <persName>McGaugy</persName> because <persName>Ripton</persName> did not admit his guilt and also because he both counterfeited and passed the coin. It seems not at all unlikely that <persName>Barnet Ripton</persName> was the "<persName>Bernard Repton</persName>" who was convicted of counterfeiting at a Court of Oyer and Terminer in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> in April, 1774, and executed at the end of that month.<ref target="#CH10-n8">

            <p>In November, 1769, an indictment of one <persName>William Morgan</persName> for uttering counterfeit dollars was returned Ignoramus by the jury at the Court of Quarter Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4143221">Kent County</placeName>, and the defendant was discharged on payment of fees.<ref target="#CH10-n9">

                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> the assembly of the Three Lower Counties passed an act fixing the pillory and a fine of ¬£100 for the counterfeiting of its bills of credit. In keeping with the general trend in the other colonies the penalties became more severe. An act of 1759 appointed the penalty of death without benefit of clergy for those convicted of counterfeiting or passing counterfeited bills of the Three Lower Counties. The informer was to receive ¬£50 from the property of the convicted criminal but, if the person convicted was insolvent, the trustees of the Loan Office were then to pay the informer ¬£20. It was also provided that an individual convicted of altering the bills of the Three Lower Counties or of passing them when altered was to stand in the pillory, to have both ears nailed to the pillory and cropped, to receive thirty-one lashes on the bare back, to pay a fine of ¬£100, one half to go to the informer and one half to the government, and to pay double damages to the person grieved, as well as all costs and charges of prosecution. If the convict had no property, he might be sold for any term up to seven years to furnish satisfaction. The trustees of the Loan Office were to pay ¬£10 to the informer against an insolvent offender. The false bills were to be delivered to any of the trustees of the Loan Office, used as evidence at the trial, and then destroyed by the trustees in the presence of a committee of the assembly.<ref target="#CH10-n11">

            <p>An act for emitting ¬£30,000 in bills of credit, passed on September 2, 1775, provided the same penalties as those contained in the act of 1759, with, however, two minor exceptions: the sums to be paid by the trustees to an informer against an insolvent offender were cut in half.<ref target="#CH10-n12">

            </head>
            <p>The amount of money counterfeited during the Colonial Period can never be precisely ascertained. In many instances the sums forged have not been recorded, and, of course, only when false currency was detected, was any notice taken of it. From certain cases mentioned in this book, however, an idea of the considerable volume of counterfeits may be obtained.</p>
            <p>In the Seventeenth Century only coin was in use, and it is stated that on one occasion <persName>Charles Pickering</persName> had twenty-four pounds of silver mixed with base metal to be coined into bits. <persName>John Rush</persName> was said to have sworn that he spent half his time in making false Spanish money, and towards the close of the century the great quantity of lead and pewter farthings and half pence in circulation induced some fifty-three citizens of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> to petition the general assembly to suppress the counterfeits.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>David Wallace</persName>, it is known, imported ¬£1,000 in false <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>; one <persName>Eanon</persName>, who died during the crossing from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> to <placeName>America</placeName>, had 118 <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> counterfeit bills in his chest; in the chest of an associate, <persName>William Scot</persName>, 582 false 18<hi rend="sup">d</hi> bills were found, and another partner, <persName>Anthony Adamson</persName>, was said to have had a large quantity of the same. A coiner, <persName>Zachariah Field</persName>, had on his person false pistoles, pieces of eight and Lion dollars, while 101 false dollars were discovered in his saddle bags. A certain <persName>Grindal</persName>, it was charged, imported 600 twenty shilling bills from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>. <persName>Robert Conway</persName> and an associate named <persName>Sherwin</persName> were said to have brought in ¬£5,000 in forged bills and to have passed about ¬£700 of them before they were seized, while bills to the amount of ¬£1,668/15/‚Äì were taken from <persName>Conway</persName> and burnt. <persName>William Bodie</persName> imported ¬£700 in half crown bills; in the possession of one <persName>Whitesides</persName> 1,029 <placeName>New Castle</placeName> bills were found; <persName>Peter Long</persName> passed off nearly ¬£6,000 in counterfeits without
<pb n="150"/>
being detected, and in the chest of his cousin, <persName>Robert Jenkins</persName>, 971 forged twenty shilling bills were discovered; a man turned over to the authorities by <persName>Tom Bell</persName> had ¬£17 in bogus currency on his person; in the pocketbook of <persName>John Bellamy</persName> were found four false pistoles, a counterfeit <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> five shilling bill and ¬£80 in forged <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode Island</placeName> currency; <persName>Lummis</persName> and <persName>Bradford</persName>, seized in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, had about them 102 fifteen shilling bills, 142 twelve shilling bills and 89 six shilling bills; <persName>Heinrich Jaeger</persName> admitted that he had made ¬£40 in counterfeit money; <placeName corresp="#geonames_5191024">Germantown</placeName> coiners apparently put into circulation a vast number of false doubloons and dollars; <persName>Sigismund Hainly</persName> confessed that he had imported ¬£20 in counterfeit paper; <persName>Daniel Jeffron</persName>, when taken up, had on him about 1,000 false <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> ten shilling bills, which <persName corresp="#viaf_223945477">Governor Sharpe</persName> of that province referred to as "a vast quantity"; <persName>John Davis</persName>, when arrested, was in possession of ¬£3,500 in counterfeits; <persName>Herman Rosencrans</persName> had on his person when apprehended 68 bills of ¬£3 each; <persName>Samuel Ford, Jr.</persName>, was so prolific and successful in his counterfeiting that his associates called him she treasurer of the three provinces; one <persName>Kelly</persName> and another Irishman had on them when taken into custody 80 False <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> eight dollar bills, and in their chests were found 874 more bills, all brought in from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>; in the lodgings of <persName>Zachariah Smith Allen</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> were discovered 32 forged bills of ¬£3 each and ¬£70 worth of goods, presumably purchased with counterfeits.</p>
            <p>The above items, incomplete as they must of necessity be, show the serious nature of the attempts to counterfeit the money of the colonies and the evil effects on the credit of the provincial paper currency. <persName corresp="#viaf_6469121">Lieutenant Governor Gordon</persName> in 1727 compared counterfeiting with poisoning the waters of a country and declared that it "would effectually overthrow all Credit, Commerce and Traffick, and the mutual Confidence that must subsist in Society, to enable the Members of it to procure to themselves and Families their necessary Bread," and <persName>David Lloyd</persName>, Speaker of the House, spoke of it as a "detestable Crime." <persName corresp="#viaf_18757496">Lieutenant Governor Thomas</persName>, in advocating severer legislation against counterfeiting, stated: "Few
<pb n="151"/>
things require more the Attention of a Government than the Money current in it; for upon the real value of that depends all confidence in Trade, Forreign and Domestick. Yours has been so frequently counterfeited of late, that there is reason to apprehend the Security of your Laws has given encouragement to it." Later, Governor <persName>Belcher</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, reporting to the council and assembly of that province the activity of a band of counterfeiters, remarked: "And this Matter well deserves your speedy Care and strict Enquiry, as it strikes at the very Vitals of your Currency, and so must nearly affect not only your Commerce, but your other Estates also." The importance of checking counterfeiting was also stressed by <persName corresp="#viaf_1481669">Lieutenant Governor Richard Penn</persName> when he wrote in 1773 in a proclamation: "It is of the greatest Importance to the Trade and Commerce of this Province, that the Credit of all such bills as have been emitted by Law, should be supported and preserved, and that Forgers and Counterfeiters of them should be discovered, and brought to condign and exemplary Punishment."</p>
            <p>The greatest suffering from counterfeit money was on the part of the poor and ignorant. This fact was well known and was, for example, pointed out in the <hi rend="italic">Pensylvanische Berichte</hi> by <persName corresp="#viaf_34890457">Christopher Sauer</persName>, who wrote that it was impossible to make a perfect copy of a bill, since the printer of the genuine currency "has‚Ä¶secret signs of which another person does not think. The poor man accepts the counterfeit and cannot keep it long; whoever has doubts about it then goes to the printer. The printer knows his own work, and thus the matter becomes apparent. It is shameful for one to try to support himself in this fashion, for usually the poor or the stupid or simple people have to suffer from it if they want to buy something or pay their debts when those who understand it do not take the money from them or when they make a cross through it."</p>
            <p>Coin was, as a rule, counterfeited in the provinces, and, in the course of time, so was the paper currency to a greater and greater extent; a very large amount of paper money, however, was imported from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2750405">Holland</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, and above all from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>. This
<pb n="152"/>
may be readily understood, for suitable paper and capable printers and engravers were easily found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName>. <persName>Jenkins</persName>, <persName>Long</persName>, <persName>Bodie</persName> and <persName>Davis</persName>, for example, had bills made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. <persName>Daniel Jeffron</persName> secured his counterfeits in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2759794">Amsterdam</placeName>. <persName>Sigismund Hainly</persName> had false half crown and nine penny bills made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>; the <placeName>New Castle</placeName> counterfeit money circulating in 1753 was thought to be imported from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>; in 1775 two "foreigners" were reported to be trying to have <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> currency printed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_6469121">Lieutenant Governor Gordon</persName> in 1727 stated: "‚Ä¶ the design has been laid to pour in upon us a Flood of our Own Bills Counterfeited from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, where they have so artfully imitated most of those of Jersey, that it requires more skill to distinguish them, than is to be expected amongst the common, and especially amongst Country people." And <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> was indeed the source of the counterfeits imported by <persName>Wallace</persName>, <persName>Eanon</persName>, <persName>Scot</persName>, <persName>Adamson</persName>, <persName>Grindal</persName>, <persName>Conway</persName>, <persName>Whitesides</persName>, probably <persName>Samuel Ford</persName>, and <persName>Kelly</persName>. <persName corresp="#viaf_34890457">Christopher Sauer</persName>, writing in 1747, remarked: "Sometimes before false paper money has been made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> and brought into this country and invariably has been discovered at once." But <persName>Sauer</persName> was much too optimistic about the situation, as is shown by the fact that <persName>Peter Long</persName> had successfully passed away nearly ¬£6,000 in forged bills brought from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. With regard to the two emissions of 1723 and supplements in 1725‚Äì1726 it has been stated that counterfeiting of them was so successfully practised, that "within four years after their first emission it was found necessary to call in the whole, as it was not possible to discern between the good and bad notes."<ref target="#CH11-n1">

            <p>Often the occupation of a counterfeiter is not known, but sometimes it is recorded. Because of their technical knowledge a number of silversmiths are found among the counterfeiters: Charles Picker-

ing, <persName>Edward Hunt</persName>, <persName>Andrew Clark</persName>, <persName>Gideon Casey</persName>, <persName>John Bruleman</persName>, <persName>Samuel Ford, Jr</persName>., at least after he settled in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> using the alias of <persName>Baldwin</persName>, and <persName>Joseph Billings</persName>, who, like <persName>Ford</persName>, had also learned engraving and printing. Likewise persons skilled in working with metals are fairly numerous among the counterfeiters: blacksmiths such as <persName>Richard Thomson</persName>, <persName>Stephen Barnes</persName>, <persName>John Lummis</persName>, and <persName>Benjamin Gilbert</persName>; <persName>Zachariah Field</persName> is described as understanding in metal work; <persName>John Jones</persName> was a smelter; <persName>Benjamin Cooper</persName> had been a partner of <persName>Ford</persName> in the iron business; <persName>Heinrich Jaeger</persName>, a printer, apparently became involved in crime because of his trade.</p>
            <p>Other counterfeiters or passers came from various walks of life: <persName>Robert Fenton</persName> was a servant, and a skilled metal worker; <persName>John Jay</persName>, <persName>Thomas James</persName> and <persName>Zachariah Smith Allen</persName> were cordwainers; <persName>Hercules Roney</persName> and <persName>William Kerr</persName> were weavers; <persName>Anthony Adamson</persName> was a ship captain, and <persName>Ichabod Higgins</persName> and probably also <persName>Robert Jenkins</persName> were sailors; <persName>Robert Duncan</persName>, <persName>Matthew Berry</persName> and <persName>Dennis Connell</persName> were described as yeomen; <persName>Rice Price</persName> was a slaughterer; <persName>Thomas Carr</persName> was a laborer; <persName>Archilaus Lewis</persName> was a tavernkeeper; <persName>Richard Cooley</persName> was a perukemaker; <persName>Bern Budd</persName> was a doctor; <persName>John King</persName> had been undersheriff of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>; <persName>Squire Ayres</persName> was a justice of the peace and deacon; six women were concerned in counterfeiting: <persName>Martha Hunt</persName>, the wife of <persName>Edward Hunt</persName>, <persName>Rebecca Johns</persName>, <persName>Margaret Thomas</persName>, <persName>Susannah Buckler</persName>, <persName>Ann Tew</persName> and <persName>Alice Richards</persName>.</p>
            <p>A remarkable number of counterfeiters broke jail or fled from justice, an indication of their resourcefullness and of the insecurity of the jails of the time: <persName>William Sinton</persName>, <persName>John Jones</persName>, <persName>Joseph Watt</persName>, <persName>Isaac Gray</persName>, <persName>Joseph Bradford</persName>, <persName>Ichabod Higgins</persName>, <persName>John Hannah</persName>, <persName>Samuel Ford, Jr.</persName>, <persName>Grindal</persName>, <persName>Andrew Stewart</persName>, and <persName>John McAllister</persName> were successful in breaking out of jail; <persName>Jacob Ebberman</persName> fled from the officer who was taking him to prison, as did <persName>Joseph Richardson</persName>; <persName>John Nicholas</persName> and <persName>Henry Bosworth</persName> forfeited their bail and fled; <persName>Thomas James</persName>, <persName>William James</persName>, and <persName>John Gilkey, Jr.</persName>, took to their heels and could not be found when wanted by the court.</p>
            <pb n="154"/>
            <p>In the seventeenth century an amazing difference is found in the punishment meted out to counterfeiters: <persName>Pickering</persName>, <persName>Buckley</persName> and <persName>Fenton</persName> were convicted of counterfeiting and circulating Spanish coin ‚Äì ‚Äì they claimed that their mint was not in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> ‚Äì ‚Äì and <persName>Pickering</persName>, found guilty of a high misdemenor, had to make satisfaction to the persons injured, pay a fine of ¬£40 and give security for good behavior; <persName>Buckley</persName> was fined ¬£10 and required to furnish security for good behavior; <persName>Fenton</persName> was sentenced to sit in the stocks for one hour. <persName>Lasy</persName>, who confessed that he had counterfeited Spanish money and passed it, was sentenced to stand at the public place of correction in <placeName>Chester</placeName> on two different court days for three hours each day, to bear affixed on his breast a paper with his crimes written in capital letters, and to pay costs.</p>
            <p>Only two years later, however, <persName>Charles Butler</persName>, convicted only of passing false Spanish coin, was charged with misprision of treason and sentenced to have his entire estate confiscated and to be imprisoned for life. To be sure, the council of the province recommended mercy in his case and he was probably pardoned.</p>
            <p>In 1720 <persName>Edward Hunt</persName>, who had counterfeited Spanish coin, was convicted of high treason and executed, while his wife, <persName>Martha</persName>, who was convicted of passing her husband's counterfeits, was fined ¬£500 and sentenced to imprisonment for life.</p>
            <p>When the first <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> paper bills were emitted, it was provided that counterfeiting or passing should be punished by pillorying, cropping of both ears and whipping with thirty-one lashes. In addition a person convicted was to pay a fine of ¬£100, costs, double damages to the person grieved, and, if insolvent, might be sold for a term up to seven years to make satisfaction.</p>
            <p>A law passed in 1739 made counterfeiting the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills, within or without the province, or knowingly passing such counterfeits, punishable by death without benefit of clergy, while altering or passing altered <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills was punishable by pillorying, flogging with thirty-one lashes, cropping of both ears, and paying a fine of ¬£100, costs, and double damages to the person grieved.</p>
            <pb n="155"/>
            <p>In 1767 <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> provided the death penalty for counterfeiting any gold or silver coin current in the province. A person convicted of knowingly passing such false coin was to stand one hour in the pillory, have both ears cropped, and pay a fine of ¬£100 and costs and charges of prosecution.</p>
            <p>In 1773 an act was passed imposing the penalty of death without benefit of clergy on any person convicted of counterfeiting the paper currency of any British colony in <placeName>America</placeName> or of passing it when so counterfeited. For altering or passing altered currency of any such colony the penalty was pillorying, cropping of both ears, flogging with thirty-nine lashes, paying double damages to the person grieved, a fine of ¬£100 and all costs. The same year the assembly of <placeName>New Castle</placeName>, <placeName>Kent</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4144895">Sussex</placeName> passed a similar act.</p>
            <p>The Three Lower Counties on <placeName corresp="#geonames_4142224">Delaware</placeName> set as the earliest penalties for counterfeiting their paper currency or for passing it when so counterfeited the pillory and a fine of ¬£100. An act of 1759, however, made such offences punishable by death without benefit of clergy, while a person convicted of altering their bills or of knowingly passing them when altered was to stand in the pillory, have both ears cropped, receive thirty-one lashes, pay a fine of ¬£100, all costs and double damages to the person grieved.</p>
            <p>Persons executed for counterfeiting in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> were <persName>Edward Hunt</persName>, <persName>Sigismund Hainly, Sr.</persName>, <persName>Herman Rosencrans</persName> and <persName>Bernard Repton</persName>. Three others were condemned to death, <persName>Sigismund Hainly, Jr.</persName>, <persName>Andrew Stewart</persName> and <persName>John McAllister</persName>, of whom <persName>Hainly</persName> was pardoned and the other two broke jail and fled.</p>
            <p>The legislation mentioned above in general guided the courts in the eighteenth century. There was, however, considerable variation in the severity of the sentences meted out. As a rule there was a combination of punishments inflicted. Persons punished with the pillory, cropping of both ears, and thirty-one lashes appear to have been <persName>Richard Kinner</persName>, <persName>John Hawkins</persName>, <persName>Lawrence Wolverston</persName>, <persName>Joseph Watt</persName>, <persName>Cornelius Walraven</persName> and <persName>Ann Tew</persName>. Some of these also incurred fines and other financial penalties. Others who stood in the pillory in
<pb n="156"/>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> or the Three Lower Counties were <persName>Samuel Jackson</persName>, <persName>Hercules Roney</persName>, <persName>James Huston</persName>, <persName>William Kerr</persName>, <persName>Daniel Jeffron</persName>, <persName>John Underwood</persName>, <persName>Barnet Ripton</persName>, <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Eastburn</persName>, <persName>John Anderson</persName>, <persName>Josiah Pitt</persName>, <persName>Anthony Adamson</persName>, <persName>William Scot</persName>, <persName>Robert Teas</persName>, <persName>Robert Black</persName>, <persName>Robert Conway</persName> and his partner, <persName>Sherwin</persName>, <persName>Whitesides</persName>, <persName>James Williamson</persName>, <persName>John Thomas Jones</persName>, <persName>Stephen Barnes</persName> and <persName>Francis Huff</persName>.</p>
            <p>Individuals flogged were <persName>Roney</persName>, <persName>Huff</persName>, <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Eastburn</persName>, and <persName>Anderson</persName>, each with twenty-one lashes; <persName>Kerr</persName>, <persName>Ripton</persName>, <persName>Tew</persName> and <persName>Teas</persName>, each with thirty-nine lashes; <persName>Robert Black</persName> with twenty lashes; <persName>Matthew Berry</persName> and <persName>Dennis Connell</persName> each with eight lashes on one indictment and seven on another; other persons flogged ‚Äì ‚Äì the number of lashes is not stated ‚Äì ‚Äì were <persName>M√ºller</persName>, <persName>Durry</persName>, <persName>Blayster</persName>, <persName>Jeffron</persName>, <persName>Conway</persName> and <persName>Sherwin</persName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Kerr</persName>, <persName>Jeffron</persName>, <persName>Hannah</persName> and <persName>Rosencrans</persName> each had one ear cropped; <persName>Robert Black</persName>, <persName>Walraven</persName>, <persName>Conway</persName>, <persName>Sherwin</persName> and <persName>Underwood</persName> were also cropped, but it is not recorded whether one or both ears were cut off.</p>
            <p>Imprisonment was frequently imposed as a penalty in the eighteenth century, for example, on <persName>George Perkins</persName>, <persName>Samuel Jackson</persName> (four months), <persName>Christopher Marshall</persName> (two months), <persName>Jacob Greator</persName> (one month), <persName>David Robinson</persName> (three months), <persName>Joseph Richardson</persName>, <persName>Alice Richards</persName> (six months), <persName>John Thomas Jones</persName> (six months) and <persName>Stephen Barnes</persName> (six months).</p>
            <p>Sometimes all property was confiscated, as apparently in the case of <persName>George Perkins</persName>. Fines were often imposed: ¬£100 in the cases of <persName>Ann Tew</persName>, <persName>Josiah Pitt</persName>, <persName>Robert Teas</persName>, <persName>Conway</persName>, <persName>Sherwin</persName> and <persName>Whitesides</persName>; ¬£50 in the cases of <persName>Christopher Marshall</persName>, <persName>William Kerr</persName>, <persName>Gideon Casey</persName> and <persName>Samuel Jackson</persName>; ¬£40 in the cases of some convicted coiners; ¬£30 in the case of <persName>James Huston</persName>; ¬£25 in the cases of <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Eastburn</persName>; ¬£20 in the cases of certain coiners; ¬£15 in the case of <persName>William Shremer</persName> (later ¬£10 of this was remitted); ¬£10 in the cases of <persName>David Robinson</persName> and of certain coiners of gold; ¬£5 in the cases of <persName>Jacob Greator</persName>, <persName>Philip McGaugy</persName>, and some coiners of silver.</p>
            <pb n="157"/>
            <p>In some instances those convicted were required to furnish security for their good behavior, sometimes for twelve months, as <persName>Samuel Jackson</persName>, <persName>Christopher Marshall</persName>, <persName>John Eastburn</persName>, <persName>Philip McGaugy</persName>, <persName>Barnet Ripton</persName> and <persName>John Anderson</persName>, or for six months, as <persName>John Thomas Jones</persName> and <persName>Stephen Barnes</persName>.</p>
            <p>When bills were emitted, it was left to the discretion of a committee to select such devices as would render counterfeiting difficult. As <persName corresp="#viaf_34890457">Christopher Sauer</persName> pointed out, it was impossible for paper currency to be imitated in such a way that the printer of the genuine bills could not recognize the counterfeits. It was difficult for the criminals to copy accurately the signatures of the signers, and still harder to match the ink and paper. In fact, the paper was a special obstacle for the counterfeiter, and this was particularly true in the case of the paper which came to be used by <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> and which was white on one side and gray on the other.</p>
            <p>In some instances, as in the case of <persName>Ford</persName> and his associates, well-organized gangs were in operation and were in contact with other similar groups. The formation of counterfeiting gangs was a growing tendency in the later years of the colonial period, and during the Revolution counterfeiters operated on a vast scale both for profit and to injure the credit of the patriot money.</p>
