               <p>The year 473 B. C. was a disastrous one for Tarentum. In that year, we learn from <name type="place">Aristotle</name>;<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> although they were supported by an auxiliary force of 3000 Rhegians, the Tarentines sustained a crushing defeat at the hands of the Messapo-Iapyginians and the Peuketians. This appalling reverse took place not far from where the villages of <name type="pname">Mottola</name> and <name type="place">Gioja del Colle</name> now stand. Perhaps the most important result was a change of the constitution and the establishment of a democracy. This triumph of the popular party, according to <name type="pname">Franéois Lenormant</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> was prompted by the <name type="place">Athenian</name> democratic spirit which, thirty years later, was to be so strongly evident in <name type="pname">Magna Grécia</name>, after the foundation of Thurium.</p>
               <pb n="2"/>
               <p>It has long been supposed that this democratic revolution left its mark in the <name type="place">Tarentine</name> coinage of the period, and that the first issue of <hi rend="italic">nomoi</hi>,<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> exhibiting on their reverse the new type of a seated male figure, is to be brought into relation with this institution of a democratic form of government at Tarentum.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Raoul Rochette</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> in a learned and interesting paper on this class of coins, endeavored to prove that the seated figure could be none other than the Demos, or impersonation of the Tarentine people, and this identification, although incorrect, has held the field since first expressed by this erudite <name type="place">French</name> numismatist in 1833. The three accurate plates<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> which were carefully engraved and published with his paper, owing to new types which have since come to light, are now inadequate.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Sir Arthur J. Evans</name> in his masterly monograph "The Horsemen of Tarentum",<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> has also given us, so far as the scope of his work would allow, an excellent chronological summary of this class of coins. For details, however, he refers the reader
<pb n="3"/>
to the publication by Raoul Rochette.</p>
               <p>It is with this long neglected and very interesting series that I am here proposing to deal at some length, giving a description and a tentatively chronological classification of all the hitherto known die-combinations. As <name type="pname">Rochette's</name> essay is now out of print, I believe such a work will be of great service to students as this series includes some of the finest products of the Tarentine mint.</p>
               <p>Carelli,<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> in his monumental work, though far more complete than <name type="pname">Garrucci</name>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> for this class of coins, is often inaccurate, although some of his results are very beautiful.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> As I hope to show, many of his engravings are misleading and untrustworthy. In fact, neither the engraver of Carelli's plates, nor any other engraver, can successfully give the stylistic<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> differences of the original coins he is depicting. His task was made increasingly difficult because most of the specimens of this series which have been preserved for us, are found, owing to their long circulation, in very poor condition only. Frequently,
<pb n="4"/>
too, they are imperfectly struck. A really fine, well-centered nomos of this class with both types complete is very rare, and brilliant specimens in <hi rend="italic">fleur de coin</hi> condition are hardly ever to be seen. Their study, in consequence, is surrounded with peculiar difficulties, and this plea is offered in extenuation of discrepancies we shall find in the interpretations of the accessory symbols on certain rare types represented only by poorly preserved examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Raoul Rochette's</name> theory that the seated figure was no other than the Tarentine Demos, is now rightly discarded by the majority of numismatists<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> since the controversy between <name type="pname">Mr. E. J. Seltman</name>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> and the late <name type="pname">Mr. J. P. Six</name>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> about the so-called "seated Demos of Rhegium". Both numismatists, while disagreeing on the explanation of this Rhegian coin-type, rightly recognized that at Tarentum the seated figure was certainly Taras, the eponymous founder or "oekist", expressly designated<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> by the inscription TAPAΣ on the architype of this series. They agreed to reject "the Demos theory", such abstract
<pb n="5"/>
and allegorical figures not having come into use earlier than the fourth century.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Sir Arthur J. Evans</name> wrote,<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> in 1889,
<q>"Although this figure has with great probability been regarded as an impersonation of the Tarentine Demos, it is none the less true that this personification was itself assimilated to the idea of the heroic founder,"</q>
and clearly anticipated the above conclusion which tallies with the opinion expressed by the late <name type="pname">Dr. Head</name> in the first edition of his famous <hi rend="italic">Historia Numorum,</hi> (1887).</p>
               <p>The existence of a <name type="place">pre-Hellenic city</name>, at Tarentum, before the arrival of the Lacedaemonian colonists, led by Phalanthos (circa 705 B. C.), may today be considered as well authenticated. The old city of the native Salentines and Messapo-Iapygians who first possessed the country, undoubtedly received at a very early date a rather important Cretan element through colonization.<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Ancient tradition<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> reports that Icadios, Apollo's son, and his brother Iapyx, had
<pb n="6"/>
both sailed from Crete for <name type="place">Italy</name>. Iapyx after his safe arrival founded the Iapygian colony. Icadios was miraculously saved from shipwreck by a dolphin on whose back he came to the Parnassos shore. With Iapyx had also landed in Italy, Satyra, the daughter of Minos, and the eponymous local nymph of Saturium. Beloved by Poseidon, she gave birth to Taras, the heroic native founder or "oekist" of Tarentum. Taras also gave his name to a small river which runs into the sea to the west of <name type="pname">Mare Piccolo</name>. It is known even today under the name Tara. Local tradition adds that Taras, after reigning for many years, fell by accident into this river while offering a sacrifice to his father, Poseidon. The Tarentines, unable to find his body and believing that Taras had left them in order to rejoin his father, immediately bestowed on him Divine Honors of Heroization. On his death, according to the Greek custom, the <hi rend="italic">οἰκιστής</hi> of each colony was worshipped as a hero, and games were often instituted in his honor.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Prof. Studniczka</name>, in his brilliant monograph
<pb n="7"/>
"Kyrene" (1890), maintains that throughout the Tarentine coinage, the legend TAPAΣ refers to the mint rather than to the type, and that the hero riding the dolphin is Phalanthos, the historical oekist of Tarentum. This theory is in harmony with the lines of Pausanias (lib. x. ch. 13):</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"For before Phalanthus reached Italy they say that he was cast away in the <name type="pname">Criséan Sea</name>, and was brought to land by a dolphin." (Frazer's Translation, Vol. V, p. 519).</q>
               </p>
               <p>This identification is shared by <name type="pname">Mr. Aubrey Gwyn</name>, a firm believer in the value of local tradition, in his very remarkable papers<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> "The Character of Greek Colonization." However, <name type="pname">Sir Arthur J. Evans,</name> whose opinion is always entitled to great weight prefers in accordance with Pollux quoting <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>, to call the dolphin rider "Taras". I cannot presume to enter into a discussion of the value of the arguments adduced on either side, but for the early Tarentine coinage new data will be presented in the course of this study. These
<pb n="8"/>
lead me to prefer <name type="pname">Prof. Studniczka's</name> theory. After the beginning of the fourth century, when the dolphin rider is first represented on coins in a boyish form more appropriate to the youthful Taras, it is more cautious to follow <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evans</name> and <name type="pname">M. E. Babelon.</name>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> It is, however, impossible to decide where and when Phalanthos ends and Taras begins. Divine honors were paid to both heroes and in early days they were probably confused under the same worship. I therefore venture to recognize on the so-called "democratic" series: Phalanthos, the historic founder of Tarentum astride on the dolphin, opposed to the seated Taras, the mythic <hi rend="italic">οἰκίοτύς</hi>, just as we shall later find them similarly opposed on certain subsequent "horsemen".<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> Taras and Phalanthos, as it might be presumed, are thus both worthily commemorated on this beautiful series of coins.</p>
               <p>Taras, the seated oekist, is portrayed in varied aspects showing his intimate association with the city he has founded. As a hero, he appears seated holding out a kantharos (Pl. I), and his heroic character
<pb n="9"/>
in one case is emphasized by the introduction of a sepulchral altar in front of him (Type 33). As the founder and organizer of a hereditary monarchy which was to be continued for a few years after the end of the sixth century, we shall find him holding the royal staff (Type 50). As an active agent and as creator of the community's industrial pursuits, he is frequently represented holding the wool distaff, a reference to the famous Tarentine textile industry (Pls. II-VII). In other instances, he is depicted as an ephebos indulging in the pleasures of youth (Pls. VIII, XII and XIII). As the son of Poseidon, he holds the trident—a sign of his maritime power (Types 9 to 9B, and 15); and when grouped with the panther, he appears closely akin to the <name type="pname">Chthonic Dionysos</name>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> always connected at Tarentum with the heroized departed (Pls. IX-XI). <hi rend="italic">En resumé</hi> Taras appears as the embodiment of the race; and in honoring their cekist, the Tarentines did little more than give full scope to their religious faith and civic pride.</p>

               <head>DATING AND CLASSIFICATION.</head>
               <p>Owing to the absence of dependable historic data, an arrangement into definite chronological periods for the Oekists (as for convenience the writer proposes to call this class of Tarentine <hi rend="italic">Nomoi)</hi> is an extremely difficult undertaking. As already noted <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evans</name> has given the following chronological summary dividing them into three main categories:</p>
               <p rend="hang">Class I.—Of Archaic character (guilloche border) B. C. 473–466.</p>
               <p rend="hang">Class II.—The seated Demos surrounded by a wreath. B. C. 466–460.</p>
               <p rend="hang">Class III.—Alternated with early equestrian types. B. C. 460 to c. 420.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Dr. Head</name> in his second edition of <hi rend="italic">Historia Numorum</hi> accepts this dating but <name type="pname">Dr. K. Regling</name>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> prefers to divide the Oekists into only two distinct periods.</p>
               <p rend="hang">I. —From 473 to 450 B. C.</p>
               <p rend="hang">II. —From 420 to 400 B. C.</p>
               <p>and even dates as low as the third century B. C., a <hi rend="italic">nomos</hi> of this class, of abnormally low weight, formerly in the Warren collection.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="11"/>
               <p>The writer hopes to bring forward serious considerations to show that the oekists do not form, as generally assumed, a single and continuous issue, alternating with the first equestrian types, as shown by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evans</name>, but that from the very beginning of their issue they were alternated and often struck simultaneously with other early Tarentine nomoi presenting on the reverse die, opposed to the youthful hero astride on the dolphin, various types which were struck in more than one <hi rend="italic">atelier</hi> of the ancient Tarentine mint. After the first issue of the excessively rare Tarentine incuse nomoi, minted for commerce with the Achéan cities of <name type="pname">Magna Grécia</name>, the chronological order of the subsequent double relief series is reasonably certain.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> We are, however, still ignorant of the exact duration of the issues exhibiting in turn on their reverse, the wheel, the hippocamp, the archaic head of Taras or of his mother the local nymph Satyra. The last types of one group and the earliest of another invariably overlap.</p>
               <p>The evidence of finds, the study of the

various dies, the close comparison of style, fabric and epigraphy of each of the above types, shows, in the writer's opinion, that many nomoi with these varied reverses were often issued simultaneously and for a longer period than has been recognized hitherto.</p>
               <p>The date of issue of several of the latest nomoi with the wheel, hippocamp, male or female head reverses, must be brought down almost to the middle of the fifth century, i.e. about thirty-five years after the appearance of the first oekist. This I hope to show was struck at the latest c. 485 B. C. Indeed when we find the inscription TAPA<graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/> on nomoi exhibiting the wheel,<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> hippocamp,<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> or juvenile head,<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> of late archaic or even early transitional style, denoting issues later than c. 473 B. C. (the cable border or early double circle enclosing a ring of beads or pellets having given way to the plain beaded ring), we are fully authorized to date the issue of these coins many years after the earliest seated oekists of pure archaic style (inscribed <graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/>AяAT, surrounded by a cable
<pb n="13"/>
border in conformity with the early incuse coinage, c. 550-520 B. C.), or the first archaic hippocamp nomoi struck about 510 B. C.</p>
               <p>In this paper it is my purpose to supplement the work of Raoul Rochette. In order to secure many of the facts that I have been able to collect, I have ransacked every available source of information, including old and recent sale catalogues, pamphlets and monographs, not neglecting several rather obsolete numismatic works now rarely consulted.</p>
               <p>Owing to the kindness of the keepers of public cabinets and of private collectors to whom my sincerest thanks are extended, I have been able to bring together casts of a large number of oekists. This assemblage, without purporting to be considered as a <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi>, has some fair claim to being as nearly as possible complete and up to date.</p>
               <p>The following public and private cabinets in which oekists are represented have been personally visited, when possible, or consulted for the present study:</p>

               <p>I regret that the learned keeper of the <name type="place">Taranto</name> Museum, Cav.

I have particular pleasure in expressing in these lines my sincerest indebtedness to <name type="pname">Mr. Sydney P. Noe</name>, the Secretary of the American Numismatic Society who has read the proofs of this article and given me invaluable help in securing many important casts which I had been unable to obtain.</p>
               <p>In my attempts to distribute the oekists into successive chronological divisions, I have always taken into account the invaluable
<pb n="16"/>
evidence supplied by finds which have come to my knowledge during the last twenty-five years, in the course of repeated visits to <name type="place">Southern Italy</name> and <name type="place">Taranto</name> itself. Unfortunately, for obvious reasons, this evidence, which should always supply the safest and best data for fixing any chronological succession, must, nowadays, be weighed with greatest caution. Dealers or detainers of coin-hoards are invariably inclined to conceal the real circumstances of finds, and rarely take the trouble to note their composition before their dispersal. They always prefer to give unreliable or even misleading information, in order to avoid trouble with the authorities, thus depriving science of invaluable assistance.<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The epigraphic evidence supplied by Tarentum's early coinage, although very valuable, must also be taken into account rather cautiously and given weight only when supplemented by the evidence of style and fabric. We find, for instance, on some of the early incuse nomoi, the form <graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/>AяAT on the obverse associated with
<pb n="17"/>
TARA<graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/> on the reverse of the same coin ;<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> on others,<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> of extreme rarity and of somewhat later style, <graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/>AяAT figuring on either side. On the subsequent double relief series the forms of letters and direction of inscriptions appear often to vary at random on unquestionably contemporary issues<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> and even on the obverse and reverse of the same coins, probably according to the degree of instruction, the fancy or the origin of the engravers. This condition is present on the succeeding series as well, even down to 315 B. C., when we find on a gold drachm or half stater the inscription A<graphic url="NNM15_sym2.jpg"/>AT retrograde.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref>
               </p>
               <p>This series is made simpler by the fact that with three exceptions, the obverse type is the <hi rend="italic">παράσημου,</hi> Phalanthos, astride on the dolphin. Later <hi rend="italic">we</hi> shall see how he comes to be confused with Taras. Very often the same obverse die is used with several reverse dies. At other times the same reverse die will be utilized with a new obverse die but such cases are very rare owing to the greater wear upon reverse dies. The rather long and continued
<pb n="18"/>
service of certain obverse dies allows us to determine with certainty the chronological succession of the reverses combined with them, using the state of wear shown or the progression of breaks or defects as criteria.</p>
               <p>In fact, that the die criterion is the safest and most conclusive in any tentative chronological arrangement, has been fully demonstrated by the notable results obtained by such able numismatists as Messrs. <name type="pname">P. Gardner, G. F. Hill, Sir Arthur Evan</name>, <name type="pname">Prof. K. Regling, Messrs. J. Mavrogordato, C. T. Seltman, Miss Agnes Baldwin</name> and, foremost of all, by <name type="pname">Prof. Tudeer</name> and <name type="pname">Mr. E. T. Newell.</name>
               </p>
               <p>Unfortunately the bad preservation of most of the existing oekists renders the die comparisons somewhat delicate, though long numismatic experience can nearly always make the necessary allowances for wear in circulation or defective striking.</p>
               <p>Chronological conclusions based on style considerations are also very important when applied to the oekists. They were first issued when the finest archaic Ionian
<pb n="19"/>
art, imported during the aristocratic rule at Tarentum, was flourishing in <name type="pname">Magna Grécia</name>. They were struck down to c. 400 B. C., when the truly Tarentine art was beginning to attain its freest and most congenial development. The gradual variations of style displayed on the oekist series are very remarkable, but we quickly observe, as with other contemporary issues,<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> that the finest types with the seated oekist of purely Grecian style (viz. the master dies) have been copied, time after time, by contemporary indigenous engravers of very unequal capacity and often in a rather poor style. These are characteristic examples of the uneven work to be found in other <name type="pname">Magna Grécia</name>n mints even during the best period. This is proved by the evidence of several finds, and is in agreement with the opinion expressed by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> in his paper "The Artistic Engravers of Terina" (<hi rend="italic">Num. Chron.,</hi> 1912). In other instances, several types of oekists have been coarsely imitated in a very barbarous style by the "Mixo-Barbari", avery appropriate name
<pb n="20"/>
for the indigenous Messapo-Iapygian and Peuketian borderers. Not having any coinage of their own, they struck barbarous imitations of the Tarentine issues from the very beginning of the double relief series,<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref> probably at Lupia or Sallentium. Reference will be made to all the plated oekists I have been able to trace and I shall describe them at the end of each group of the normal series to which they belong.</p>
               <p>Finally I shall also include in my catalogue a few other extremely rare plated oekists, which through their artless and unintelligent design betray the work of ancient forgers. These forgeries are generally a combination of the obverse and reverse types belonging to two different issues. They are real "mules" and they supply us with valuable help in dating several normal series.</p>
               <p>I am fully aware that the chronological succession proposed in this paper for the various types of the seated oekist, can at some points be but tentative and conjectural. Many time-limits are quite arbitrary
<pb n="21"/>
and when venturing to determine new datings in contradiction to those hitherto holding the field, it should be understood that the author does not make for them any claim to finality. He will feel entirely satisfied if the present undertaking proves useful for the further investigation and study of a long neglected series of coins. From an artistic standpoint this series offers us in a compendious form, a brief but invaluable record of the formation and progression of Tarentine art during the fifth century.</p>
               <p>As most of the oekists are rare, I have given under each type the list of all specimens known to me struck from the same combination of dies, without pretending to quote all extant examples especially for the commoner types. When selecting specimens to figure on the plates I have always taken the finest procurable and, when necessary, given the photograph of more than one example, in order to give a complete representation of any particularly rare type hitherto inaccurately described. Whenever possible I have noted
<pb n="22"/>
the weight, size and provenance, such information often helping to identify a coin previously published by other authors.</p>
               <p>With regard to the chronological arrangement followed in the course of the present study I have divided, for the sake of convenience, the issues of the Tarentine oekists into four main Periods summarized within their approximately chronological limits, as follows:</p>
               <p>I.—Of archaic style (showing the influence of early Ionian and Spartan sculpture), B. C. c. 485-473.</p>
               <p>II.—Of late archaic to early transitional style (influence of Pythagoras of Rhegium) B. C. c. 473-460.</p>
               <p>III.—Of transitional to early fine style (influence of Peloponnesian and early Attic sculpture), B. C. c. 460-443.</p>
               <p>IV.—Of early fine style to period of finest art (Attic influence of Pheidian sculpture and pictorial influence of Zeuxis), B. C. c. 443-400.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 1.</hi> This beautiful and, in my experience, all but unique nomos, was published by Fiorelli<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> when describing briefly the splendid example in the <name type="place">Naples</name> cabinet. <name type="pname">Garrucci</name> in his inaccurate engraving<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> of the same coin, as usual, alters the exquisite archaic purity and delicacy of the original. This coin is an admirable example of all that is finest in Gréco-Ionian archaic art, and certainly one of the masterpieces of Magna Graecia's early coinage.</p>
                  <p>The obverse of the specimen that I am fortunate in possessing, owing to its worn condition strongly recalls several beautiful early grave stelé. <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> has rightly pointed out in his famous monograph,<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref> the striking parallelism between the earliest oekists of this type and the old Spartan sepulchral<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> reliefs on which
<pb n="26"/>
the heroized deceased holding out a kantharos,<ref target="#CH1-n40">40</ref> is represented seated upon a similar throne, alone or with his wife. In fact Type No. 1 gives us the key of the meaning of this new type.</p>
                  <p>The seated, Dionysos-like figure can represent only the heroized Taras, the traditional or heroic founder (<hi rend="italic">ο</hi>ίκιστή<hi rend="italic">ς</hi>) of Tarentum. The kantharos held in his hand, which Rochette regarded as allusive to to the Tarentine vintage,<ref target="#CH1-n41">41</ref> certainly stands here as the visible emblem of heroization. The distaff, with spirally twisted wool, although it refers to this Tarentine industry,<ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref> can also be explained by its Chthonic connections,<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref> emphasizing here the sepulchral significance of the new type.</p>
                  <p>The archaic style displayed on this remarkable coin type at once strikes us as a combination of Ionian and Spartan art. One feels the tradition of the refined early Ionian art of the end of the sixth century, in the conventional delicacy of design and the skill in rendering the formal folds of the drapery. On the other hand the huge and disproportionate kantharos, the severe
<pb n="27"/>
and rather stiff attitude of the seated Taras reminds us strongly of the early Peloponnesian influence. The bearded head<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref> of the heroized oekist, with its early Laconian head-dress, recalls the well known life size bronze Head of a Warrior,<ref target="#CH1-n45">45</ref> from the Acropolis at Athens, of éginetan art, and must also be compared to the beautiful head of Zeus<ref target="#CH1-n46">46</ref> of Olympia, also belonging to the last years of the sixth century.</p>
                  <p>The quite exceptional position of the heroized Taras on the obverse die relegating the city-arms to the reverse, the unusual size of the well-spread flan, and its thin plate-like fabric, the accurate neatness of both borders enclosing the types, the design of the exergue,<ref target="#CH1-n47">47</ref> and above all the extreme rarity of this master die, single out this splendid nomos as the prototype of the oekist series. The explanation of the somewhat late archaic character of some of the letters of the inscriptions may be due to the foreign origin of the engraver, a true artist, possibly of Ionian birth.</p>
                  <p>The reverse die exhibits Phalanthos, both hands extended, the palms turned
<pb n="28"/>
downward in suppliant guise. This type, slightly modified, had made its first appearance on three very rare nomoi,<ref target="#CH1-n48">48</ref> with the wheel reverse, the latest of which cannot have been struck much later than c. 500 B. C. It is also frequently associated with the hippocamp reverse on nomoi of transitional style,<ref target="#CH1-n49">49</ref> struck c. 473-460 B. C.</p>
                  <p>On purely numismatic grounds, and taking into account also morphological considerations, we can date the issue of type No. 1 before 476 B. C. close to the time the unique tetradrachm of étna was struck [cf. Hill, Coins of Sicily, pl. IV, 13], and a few years later than the issue of the also unique, but plated, stater of Peparethos, exhibiting Dionysos, or rather Staphylos, his heroized son seated on a diphros, which strongly recalls the first Tarentine oekist. The dating proposed by <name type="pname">Mr. W. Wroth,</name>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n50">50</ref> 490-380 B. C., for all the early silver coinage of Peparethos must, I believe, be revised and placed twenty-five years earlier on the evidence of the existence of a stater of Peparethos<ref target="#CH1-n51">51</ref> (as Wroth, pl. V, 8 with the
<pb n="29"/>
obverse die recut) in the 1911 <name type="place">Taranto</name> find. <name type="pname">M. E. Babelon</name> has dated the deposit of this hoard in which incuse Sybarite coins fresh from the mint occurred in great abundance, c. 507 B. C., a very few years after the overthrow of Sybaris. The much too late date of 473 B. C., hitherto proposed by all numismatists, had been accepted only in order to bring the appearance of a new Tarentine type into relation with the institution of the new democratic form of government, which took place in the year 473 B. C. and thus presumably confirm the seated Demos theory. There is no doubt, in the writer's opinion, that <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name>, who has accepted this late dating, must have been somewhat misled by the rather uneven style of the example of this type then possessed by him<ref target="#CH1-n52">52</ref> [pl. I, No. 1A. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and "Horsemen", pl. 1, 7].</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 1A.</hi> This nomos is only a plated coin, a rather weak and sketchy imitation of No. 1, the work of an indigenous forger probably of Messapo-Iapygian birth. All the archaic refinement and
<pb n="30"/>
beauty of style displayed on the master die, have disappeared on this plated imitation. A glance at Plate I will show how most of the details of the original have been carelessly copied by the forger. The elegant fold of the himation's end, falling behind the back of the seated oekist, is now only indicated by a rough line and all other details are, more or less, neglected. The reverse is also very awkwardly drawn, the position of the hero's arms impossible and reversed. All the splendid equipoise of the original is ruined. The legends of Type No. 1, TA<graphic url="NNM15_sym5.jpg"/>A<graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/>A<graphic url="NNM15_sym2.jpg"/>AT, are copied TA<graphic url="NNM15_sym5.jpg"/>AΣ and A<graphic url="NNM15_sym4.jpg"/>AT, the final <graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/> suppressed on the reverse for want of space.</p>
                  <p>Taking the above into consideration I cannot accept such a late date as 473 B. C. for the first appearance of the seated oekist in the early Tarentine coinage, and I trust I shall not greatly err in assigning to Type No. 1, the approximate date of before c. 485.</p>

                     <name type="pname">Mr. Arthur Sambon,</name> in a short paper<ref target="#CH1-n53">53</ref> concerning the Metapontine Acheloés didrachm,<ref target="#CH1-n54">54</ref>
                     <pb n="31"/>
expresses the opinion that, at Metapontum, the use of the cable or guilloche border was continued until 470 B. C. This border, at Tarentum, is always found on the early incuse issues [c. 550-515 B. C.], for which I cannot see my way clear to accept the much too late dates of c. 515-500 B. C., proposed lately by the same learned numismatist, in his otherwise very valuable paper on <name type="pname">Magna Grécia</name>'s incuse coinage.<ref target="#CH1-n55">55</ref> It is well ascertained, in my opinion, that the coinage introduced at Tarentum during the middle of the sixth century, was from the very start an importation of fully-formed Graeco-Ionian art, and that the earliest incuse coins were not of primitive and rude style, but of careful and masterly work.<ref target="#CH1-n56">56</ref> The cable border only very exceptionally<ref target="#CH1-n57">57</ref> figures on the "wheel" Tarentine nomoi, struck from c. 520-500 B. C., for local circulation, about ten years before the cessation of the incuse series. The usual border for the earliest nomoi of this type is a raised band ornamented with dots<ref target="#CH1-n58">58</ref> and on the latest issues of this class, after c. 500, the raised border
<pb n="32"/>
gives place to an ordinary dotted circle.<ref target="#CH1-n59">59</ref> The same remarks apply to the hippocamp series and there is no doubt that the cable border wholly disappears at Tarentum before 473 B. C., about ten years earlier than at Metapontum.</p>
                  <p>Various explanations<ref target="#CH1-n60">60</ref> have been given to elucidate the choice of the cable border which was so popular on the early incuse coinage of <name type="place">Southern Italy</name>. <name type="pname">Mr. W. Deonna,</name> the well-known archaeologist has, I believe, found<ref target="#CH1-n61">61</ref> the best interpretation of this highly ornamental border which can be traced to primitive Assyrian art, and even when applied on purely numismatic ground, "<hi rend="italic">C'est un symbole religieux sans doute pro-phylactique"</hi>. The cable border would thus have the same purport and meaning on <name type="pname">Magna Grécia</name>'s early coinage as the swastika on the coins of the Thraco-Macedonian coast, Corinth and Sicily, if we are to accept the new and remarkable explanation of this symbol, given by <name type="pname">Mr. J. N. Svoronos,</name> in his very able and important but much discussed, paper <hi rend="italic">"L'Hellenisme Primitif de la Macedoine"</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n62">62</ref> The cable
<pb n="33"/>
border considered as a religious apotropaion is a most becoming frame for the architype of the heroized oekist.</p>
                  <p>The chronological arrangement of the succeeding group of oekists, is fixed by the regular concatenation of the dies. This group exhibits the same archaic characteristics as the earlier version of the heroized Taras. The seated oekist is however now relegated to the reverse die. The style displayed in this group is very uneven and typical of the remarkable artistic falling back soon after 500 B. C., also to be found in other mints outside of Tarentum. It is probably the result of the anarchical spirit then prevailing in consequence of the unavoidable interference of indigenous elements which it was often necessary to tolerate. This artistic confusion lasted several years at Tarentum during the long struggle with her Messapo-Iapygian and Peuketian neighbors. I would assign to the present early issue of oekists the approximate dates of c. 480-473 B. C.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 2.</hi> This rare type closely follows the first version of the heroized Taras but the work is very different and entirely of Spartan character. The style displays a roundness and heaviness of form which contrasts strongly with the early formal elegance of the architype. The engraver has however given truer proportions to the kantharos and has happily filled up the vacant space beneath the seat with a sheep's fleece, or possibly a panther's skin (κωδioν). The mystical purport of the latter, and its consequent appropriateness for the heroized oekist, has been clearly demonstrated by <name type="pname">Mr. J. N. Svoronos.</name>

to point out that this four legged stool, throughout Grécian antiquity, has always been reserved to gods<ref target="#CH1-n66">66</ref> and the heroized departed. At Tarentum the religious and chthonic character of the diphros, is fully confirmed by the choice of a similar seat as a coin type, on some exceedingly rare small divisions<ref target="#CH1-n67">67</ref> of the nomos (probably trihemiobols = 1½ obol or 1¼ litra), at times associated with the symbol of a lustral branch.<ref target="#CH1-n68">68</ref> This latter type must represent the sacred diphros of Taras, no doubt an important ritual object, during the religious festivities (θєοξєνία or Nєκυσία) instituted in the oekist's honor.</p>
                  <p>The new παράσημον version of Phalanthos, astride on the dolphin, with his extended hands as if applauding, has been explained by <name type="pname">M. E. Babelon</name>

                  <p>This obverse die [Type 2] appears to have been in use for an unusually long time and is found coupled with four varied reverses [Types 3 to 5].</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 3.</hi> The utilization of this reverse die must have been of comparatively short duration. It was soon replaced by a new one. Fortunately among the four known examples of this rare combination of dies [Type 3], two, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, are brilliant specimens and do full justice to the archaic refinement of this type. It betrays an early Tarentine mannerism strongly contrasting with the rather heavy style of type 2.</p>
                  <p>The himation is now closely drawn round the body of Taras and reaches his chest much higher up than on types 1 and 2, giving to the seated oekist a rather effeminate appearance, and this is emphasized by the archaic chignon of his head-dress. <name type="pname">Carelli</name>

description of the androgynous type.</p>
                  <p>The charming coin (3<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) now in my cabinet, was formerly in the collection of <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name>, who had obtained it from the celebrated Archbishop of <name type="place">Taranto</name>, Capyciolatro.<ref target="#CH1-n73">73</ref> It is of abnormally high weight (8.35 gr.) and I have elsewhere<ref target="#CH1-n74">74</ref> drawn attention to this quite exceptional piece. The monetary standard employed for these issues must now be briefly considered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <name type="pname">Dr. Regling</name>, in his masterly paper on the Italic standards (Klio, Bd VI, Heft. 3, p. 504) has weighed 127 oekists giving an average weight of 7.73 gr., with a maximum of 8.22 gr. and minimum of 5.80 gr. But if we take into account only finely preserved and normal examples of the earliest issued oekists, we shall find an average weight slightly above 8 gr. This is in accordance with the normal weight of all the early Tarentine staters from 550 B. C. to c. 450. They were struck on a system in which the nomos or stater weighed 8.23 gr. or somewhat less, following with sufficient approximation, Corinth's standard, 8.25, then prevailing in <name type="pname">Magna Grécia</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n75">75</ref>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="44"/>
                  <p>
                     <name type="pname">Dr. Regling</name> has noted the following average weights for the other early Tarentine issues:</p>
                  <list rend="numbered">
                     <item n="1.">Reverse, wheel, 7.92 gr.</item>
                     <item n="2.">Reverse, archaic head, 7.83 gr.</item>
                     <item n="3.">Reverse, hippocamp, 7.95 gr.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But these slight variations in weight, for almost contemporary issues, must be a result of the condition of the examples weighed. Even after having taken into account the tendency of standards to fall, I cannot accept the figures quoted above as representing the normal Italic standard. It is only towards the end of the fifth century, that the weight of the normal Tarentine or Italic nomos comes down to 7.79 as established by <name type="pname">Dr. Regling.</name> In my opinion, even the Tarentine incuse nomoi were struck on the full weight standard, roughly in accordance with the one of about 8.29 gr. in use by the great majority of Greek Achaean cities during 550-480 B. C. The particularly thin and flat fabric of these early Tarentine incuse coins exposed them to a very rapid loss in weight through wear and oxidation, and the not
<pb n="45"/>
always obvious crystallization of the silver. <name type="pname">Dr. Regling's</name> proposed standard for these early incuse nomoi, based as it is on average weights, although sanctioned by so high an authority as the late <name type="pname">Dr. B. V. Head</name> in the second edition of <hi rend="italic">Historia Numorum</hi>, is certainly subject to error on the light side and this can only be explained as a result of condition and the small number of coins examined. <name type="pname">Dr. Regling</name> weighed four incuse nomoi, with the Hyakinthian Apollo [av. wt. 7.69 gr.], and ten of the normal type [av. wt. 7.54 gr.]. I have been able to trace<ref target="#CH1-n76">76</ref> and in most cases note the weights of 44 Tarentine incuse nomoi: 33 (Phalanthos on dolphin), 8 (the Hyakinthian Apollo), and 3 combining both types. All really fine examples invariably reach to the weight of 8 gr. The finest three and therefore the heaviest specimens among the eight incuse Tarentine nomoi in my cabinet, all from different die-combinations, weigh respectively 8.06, 8.05 and 8 gr., giving an average weight of 8.037 gr., and a fine coin of this class in the de Luynes collection weighs 8.10 gr.
<pb n="46"/>
In fact, since the Tarentine incuse nomoi were intended, as <name type="pname">Dr. Regling</name> rightly pointed out, for trade with the Achaean colonies, they could not possibly have been struck on a lower standard than the one followed at <name type="place">Taranto</name> for local use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 4.</hi> Unfortunately, all the specimens of this extremely rare type are in a bad state of preservation. Judging from the very small number I have been able to trace, the new reverse die must have been in use for a very short time only and it would seem to have been discarded owing to premature breaking. This seated oekist has the same characteristics as type 3, and the engraver has now suppressed the animal skin on the diphros. The double circle border visible on a, is quite new and a simplification of the more elaborate border on type 3, which is identical with the border of the obverse die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 5.</hi> This time the new reverse die outlives the very much worn obverse whose damaged and deteriorated condition with almost obliterated inscription, is plainly visible on the brilliant piece <hi rend="italic">a</hi> now
<pb n="47"/>
in my collection (weighing 8.22 gr. P1. I, 5<hi rend="italic">a</hi>).</p>
                  <p>At an early date the plain dotted border of type 5 had already appeared on "wheel" nomoi and is frequently met with on other contemporary types,<ref target="#CH1-n77">77</ref> all struck before c. 473 B. C.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 6.</hi> As we have seen, the above reverse die is also found combined with a new obverse die on No. 6, but a close comparison of the <name type="place">Cambridge</name> nomos No. 5<hi rend="italic">b</hi> with the four examples I have been able to trace of No. 6 shows that they were contemporaneous issues, and that the reverse die of No. 5 had evidently alternated with the obverse dies of Nos. 5 and 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 6A.</hi> This slightly differing reverse is known only in the example in the Berlin Cabinet, and is of very early and very coarse workmanship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 7.</hi> This rare type was first published by <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name> as the prototype of the oekist issue. It is remarkable for its very primitive heavy workmanship. The eye of the oekist is wide open, globular and almost protruding. The figure of Taras
<pb n="48"/>
seems of a piece with the diphros, and his body is not felt or indicated through the heavy drapery which hangs like an unyielding mass. The result is suggestive of the early Spartan style. Even the dotted border is very irregular. It would seem that the die must have been very hastily engraved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 8.</hi> This plated coin is an ancient forgery. It is of quite unusual style, and is now photographed for the first time. The unduly narrow waist of the oekist is reminiscent of late Minoan art. The omission of the final Σ of the ethnic<ref target="#CH1-n78">78</ref> on the reverse added to other peculiarities of this type, lead me to believe that we have here a new concoction of the very same engraver who forged No. IA. It is difficult to decide, however, if this interesting plated type was intended to copy No. 7 or some other contemporary normal oekist of which as yet no example has come to light.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 9.</hi> On this version the heroized oekist holds, in place of the distaff, the trident of his father Poseidon, symbolizing the sea-faring power of the city he has founded. We know almost nothing of the early history of Tarentum, save that, like
<pb n="51"/>
Sybaris and Croton, it quickly became both rich and powerful. As early as the last years of the sixth century, the Tarentines had established themselves on all the Salentine and part of the Ionian sea-coasts, as far as the Iapygian promontory. This growth came after the founding of two purely Hellenic naval colonies: Callipolis and Hydrus. These commanded both the Gulf of Tarentum and the Ionian Sea at their entrance.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately the three known examples of this new type are all carelessly struck and not well preserved. <name type="pname">Dr. G. Macdonald</name>, the distinguished keeper of the Hunter collection, in his valuable catalogue of that famous cabinet, when describing the rather poorly centred, and, at that time, the supposedly unique specimen of type 9, described the trident, held in the oekist's right hand, as a staff. After a careful re-examination of the original, at my request, <name type="pname">Dr. Macdonald</name> informed me that the seated figure holds either a trident or forked stick. Fortunately the example <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> recently come to light, and now in my
<pb n="52"/>
collection through the courtesy of <name type="pname">Mr. E. T. Newell</name>, shows quite clearly the prongs of the trident. They are of a very primitive shape, the middle prong being longer than the side ones, which curve outward. This coin confirms the very poor engraving of the Hunter specimen first given by <name type="pname">C. Combe</name>, pl. 55, No. VII, with the conspicuous but inaccurately drawn trident. The Santangelo coin <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the identification of which is impossible in Fiorelli's catalogue, has only quite recently been brought to my notice. Its condition unfortunately is very poor. Moreover it is restruck on a Corinthian Pegasos of a fairly early issue, judging from the depth of the incuse square plainly visible opposite and beneath the outstretched kantharos of the seated oekist.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the evident progress of art displayed on this type, I cannot agree to the dating of c. 460 B. C., proposed by <name type="pname">Dr. Macdonald</name>. The changed position of the legs of the seated Taras, with the left foot drawn back, so as to occupy the vacant space beneath the diphros, the refinement in the treatment of the himation, neatly
<pb n="53"/>
folded round the knees with one end hanging down in a conventional, but graceful, fold, are certainly distinct improvements. Nevertheless, the very broad shoulders and slim waist of the oekist, the unskilful combination of profile and frontal views, displayed on both dies of this type are suggestive of primitive art. So, too, with the double border, which finds a parallel only on type 4, the dotted line of exergue, and the type of Phalanthos on the dolphin holding a cuttle-fish, copied from the earliest "hippocamp" nomoi — all these are indications which authorize us to associate this remarkable type with the last issues of the preceding group, and to date type 9 before c. 473 B. C.</p>
                  <p>A close examination of examples <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, shows that the small symbol beneath Phalanthos,<ref target="#CH1-n79">79</ref> on his dolphin, is again the usual cockle-shell, but of diminutive size, with the hinge turned upwards to left. It is somewhat unskilfully drawn, but it is not an uncertain object<ref target="#CH1-n80">80</ref> or helmet, as suggested by <name type="pname">Carellis'</name> engraving — a bad copy of the Hunter coin engraved by Combe in 1782.</p>

It differs from No. 9 in that the folds of the himation are further from the feet. On <name type="pname">Carellis'</name> very inaccurate engraving of this coin, these folds are spread over and partly hide the right side of the diphros. Carelli, however, not having detected that his coin (type 9A) was from the same obverse die as the Hunter example, this time depicted the small cockle-shell beneath the dolphin correctly, and his engraving of the obverse type contrasts favorably with the absurd representation of the seated oekist (No. 9<hi rend="italic">a</hi>).</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 9B.</hi> This very charming reverse die is of a rather more advanced style and the trident, now held very close to the diphros, is of the usual shape with three upright prongs. The addition of the animal skin on the diphros is also an improvement. Many of the details are obscure owing to the worn condition of the unique Parma coin, which may have been issued a few years after Nos. 9 and 9A, in order to utilize again the same old obverse die.</p>

               <head>PERIOD II</head>
               <p>c. 473-460 B. C.</p>
               <p>If the Tarentines established themselves upon the Salentine coast without quarrelling with the natives no very great period elapsed before they were at war with them. Successful in the beginning, the Tarentines were utterly defeated by the barbarians, with great slaughter in 473 B. C. This disaster and the subsequent revolution are the first events in Tarentine history to which we can assign a definite date. The Tarentines were not long in avenging their defeat first upon the Messapo-Iapygians and a few years later upon the Peuketians. Thus all the Iapygian peninsula came into their possession and Tarentum regained its former splendor and opulence under the new democratic form of government.</p>
               <p>It is during the period of victorious prosperity almost immediately following the establishment of the new regime that I propose to ascribe the first oekist (No. 10),
<pb n="56"/>
upon which the seated Taras is seen surrounded by the olive wreath, a significant symbol of this victory<ref target="#CH1-n81">81</ref> of the Tarentine popular party. Associated with it is the new and symbolic legend <hi rend="bold">TAPANTINON,</hi> which must be translated: (Nomos) of the Tarentine People.</p>
               <p>Considering the extreme rarity of most of the other "wreathed" oekists, their issue must have been of very brief duration. This small group gives us a valuable chronological limit for a number of "unwreathed" oekists, some of which were certainly struck before the "wreathed" types. That all these issues are more or less contemporaries of each other, however, is proved by the use in common of certain obverse and reverse dies and by the progression of style from late archaic to transitional.</p>
               <p>The lines of the figures and the attitude of the seated oekist have now become much less rigid, the modelling of the body is less conventional and shows greater mastery, and the faint indications of perspective show some improvement. Many
<pb n="57"/>
types now display an effort of the die-engravers to express a feeling of poise in the seated figure. Presumably the Tarentine school of artists must by this time have felt the influence of Pythagoras of Rhegium, known as the first sculptor to aim at rhythm and symmetry<ref target="#CH1-n82">82</ref> and whose Europa seated on the Bull,<ref target="#CH1-n83">83</ref> erected at Tarentum<ref target="#CH1-n84">84</ref> soon after c. 480, was so highly prized by the Tarentines.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> has dated the Tarentine "wreathed" oekists somewhat later, B. C. 466-460, following <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n85">85</ref> in order to bring these types into connection with the appearance on the Rhegian dies of a similar type issued<ref target="#CH1-n86">86</ref> c. 466 B. C., when the Rhegians recovered their political freedom.<ref target="#CH1-n87">87</ref> I am far from denying that the Tarentine wreathed oekists, (of whose priority I am convinced) may have influenced the Rhegian coinage, but the appearance of the olive wreath on other contemporary Tarentine coin-types, one with the archaic head reverse (see <ref target="#fig-3">Fig. 1</ref>), the other of the hippocamp class, confirms, in my opinion, the commemorative character
<pb n="58"/>
of the wreath border at Tarentum, a most appropriate token of the Democratic Victory in 473 B. C.<ref target="#CH1-n88">88</ref> There can be little doubt that the symbolical wreath occurring on all these exceptional Tarentine nomoi, points to the same connection. We may, therefore, propose for this small wreathed issue, conjointly with the more important series of un wreathed oekists, standing in immediate die-relation to it, the approximative dates of c. 473-460 B. C.</p>

                  <p>A remarkable and extraordinarily rare nomos of early transitional style with the reverse die exhibiting the head of the local nymph Satyra, the mother of Taras, enclosed in a similar olive wreath, must certainly have been issued simultaneously with the oekist type No. 10. Very probably it was engraved in the same <hi rend="italic">atelier.</hi> The close affinity in design and style of both obverse dies is most striking and suggests actual identity of handiwork. <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name> first published the specimen,<ref target="#CH1-n96">96</ref> in brilliant condition, from the Brera cabinet of <name type="place">Milano</name>. A second example in the de Luynes<ref target="#CH1-n97">97</ref> collection, <name type="place">Paris</name>, has been photographed by M. E. Babelon in the <hi rend="italic">Revue Numismatique</hi> (1904), pl. I, 6. The authenticity of this type has been unjustly suspected<ref target="#CH1-n98">98</ref> and the beautiful Brera nomos put aside with other spurious coins by the
<pb n="67"/>
late curator of that collection <name type="pname">Mr. S. Am-brosoli</name>.</p>
                  <p>A third example from the same dies is now in my cabinet (see <ref target="#fig-3">Fig. No. I</ref>). It happily proves the absolute genuineness of this important coin of the "wreathed" democratic issue. It is somewhat badly struck, and is oxidized as well (weight 8.02 gr.). It comes from the small, but highly interesting, find made in 1914 in the neighborhood of <name type="place">Taranto</name> (Appendix C). There were in addition fourteen other early Tarentine nomoi of various types.</p>

                  <p>Closely allied with the above types is the the very rare "hippocamp" nomos with the crab symbol, on which the dolphin-rider holds in his extended hands a similar olive wreath. I have lately added to my

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 10A.</hi> This presumably unique plated oekist is in too poor condition to call for any special remark, but again it may possibly be the work of the same forger who engraved Nos. IA and 8.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 11.</hi> It is needless to draw attention to the beauty and attractiveness
<pb n="69"/>
of this splendid oekist in the British Museum.</p>
                  <p>The head-dress with its large chignon (κρωβύλος), the somewhat effeminate features of the oekist, his simple and hitherto unnoticed necklace,<ref target="#CH1-n103">103</ref> are late archaic or early transitional characteristics which find their counterpart on some of the youthful heads on the reverses of the earlier or contemporary Tarentine nomoi,<ref target="#CH1-n104">104</ref> litré<ref target="#CH1-n105">105</ref> and hemilitré generally identified as representing the nymph Satyra. Although there can be no question as to the femininity of most of the heads on this group of coins, the evidence of oekist No. 11 seems, in some doubtful cases, in favor of a male identification: Taras.<ref target="#CH1-n106">106</ref> On all the contemporary small fractions of the Tarentine nomos exhibiting on their obverse dies a cockle-shell, the youthful heads, on their reverses, are frequently but carefully enlarged copies of the oekist's head with its picturesquely changing headdress.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 12.</hi> This unpublished combination of dies is unique in my experience
<pb n="70"/>
and of a slightly later issue than No. n. The weak early-transitional style of the obverse die strongly recalls Nos. 10 and 13 and all these obverse dies are probably the work of the same native second-rate engraver. The condition of the reverse die points also to its posteriority in date, a small crack which does not appear on No. 11 being now visible, just above the oekist's forearm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 13.</hi> This extremely rare type, now photographed for the first time, was known until lately only from the description given by the late <name type="pname">Prof. Dressel</name> of the then unique oekist in the Berlin cabinet, formerly in the collection of General Fox. This coin is unfortunately covered with a thick coat of oxide.</p>
                  <p>The two new and very fine examples <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> came to my attention in 1920, one having found its way into the hands of a prominent dealer in Switzerland, the other having been sold in England. They were purchased by <name type="pname">Mr. Cl. Céte</name> and myself about the same time. Considering the great rarity of this type and suspecting a
<pb n="71"/>
find, I soon learned, although as usual the information was reluctantly given, that both coins came from a hoard of about 320 Tarentine nomoi, purchased at Reggio by an Italian dealer.</p>
                  <p>This find, I was told, came from the neighborhood of Gerace (?), and included before its dispersal the following types: A few nomoi of the early wheel issue (cf. Note No. 57), many "hippocamps", the two above wreathed oekists and probably an oekist of type No. 20 (cf. Pl. VI) the balance being "horsemen" of Evans Periods I and II, the latest of which, now in my cabinet, was in absolute mint state.<ref target="#CH1-n107">107</ref> The date of the deposition of this hoard may have been circa 410 B. C., a few years after the beginning of Evans Period II.</p>
                  <p>The obverse die of No. 13, of very poor transitional style, shows evident signs of wear due to its previous service with another reverse die [No. 14R, Pl. V] before being coupled with this wreathed reverse.</p>
                  <p>It is the conspicuous break of this die above the cockle-shell, that the late <name type="pname">Dr. Dressel</name> described as a symbol of doubtful
<pb n="72"/>
meaning or a fish(?). An earlier stage of this flaw is clearly visible on No. 14R of Group II A, described below.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 13A.</hi> This coin, unique to the best of my belief, although of a very similar type, is of a somewhat later archaic style. The obverse die, which is of finer work than No. 13, is also to be found coupled with another reverse on No. 16E (Group II B) cf. Pl. V.</p>
                  <p>On all the following types excepting Nos. 15 and 17, the seated Taras is represented without any border, holding the usual distaff and leaning on a long plain staff (σκη̑πρoν) symbolizing his authority over the colony he has founded.</p>
                  <p>For the sake of convenience I have divided the second group into two sub-series A and B according to the direction of the obverse type first to right, and after to left, following the data given by the various die-concatenations, which are rather intricate owing to their considerable number.</p>

<pb n="84"/>
a conspicuous elaboration of anatomical detail together with an archaic stiffness of attitude. The relation of the right arm to the body is very awkward and typical of early art. Certain other details, such as the arrangement of the formal folds of the himation, tightly drawn round the legs of Taras on No. 14, or the androgynous appearance of No. 14A, closely connect these oekist dies to No. 11 of the wreathed issue, and all three reverses may be the work of the same artist.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 14B.</hi> We have in this type a very good example of refined conventional archaic art. The position of oekist's left leg, drawn back to occupy the vacant space beneath the diphros, first inaugurated on the somewhat earlier types Nos. 9, 9A and 9B, and found also on most of the wreathed oekists [Nos. 10, 10A, 11 and 12], finds its parallel in early Ionian and Attic sculpture. In spite of these formal conventions, the figures of both Taras and Phalanthos are very advanced for the period, notwithstanding mannerisms in certain details characterizing the early transitional art.</p>
                  <pb n="85"/>
                  <p>The de Luynes specimen of this type is restruck over a Corinthian pegasos [see Pl. III, 14B. <hi rend="italic">b</hi>]. The position of the ♂, clearly visible (lying flat beneath the Pegasos), the traces of Athena's helmet and profile, the depth of the incuse square allow us to identify the Corinthian stater with tolerable probability as one of the types figured on Pl. ccviii of M. E. Babelon's <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi>, under Nos. 7 or 12.</p>
                  <p>These Corinthian coins are now dated by <name type="pname">Prof. P. Gardner</name> in his valuable "History of Ancient Coinage," circa 550 B. C. Many Metapontine staters, of the thick incuse fabric, belonging to the early years of the fifth century, are restruck on coins of Corinth of similar types and we note this peculiarity<ref target="#CH1-n108">108</ref> on another contemporary Tarentine oekist described under No. 141 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, now in Santangelo collection, <name type="place">Naples</name>. This, however, is restruck on a much earlier Corinthian pegasos, with the swastika or millsail reverse, dated c. 600-550 B. C. It is noteworthy that the weight of these restruck coins always corresponds to the correct Italic standard notwithstanding the
<pb n="86"/>
original slightly heavier weight of the Corinthian coins used as blanks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 14C.</hi> The new form of legend, on this extremely rare type, TAPANTINOΣ, has been completed by <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name> with the word △HMOΣ understood, and this was one of his best arguments, apparently confirming the seated Demos theory which has so long held the field. An unusually fine oekist in my cabinet, of a very similar type [cf. No. 16H] displays the same form of legend TAPANTINOΣ [hitherto badly read TAPANTINΩN, owing to the incomplete or poor condition of the inscription on most of the known specimens] on the obverse die, associated with the usual Tarentine παράσημου: Phalanthos astride on the dolphin.</p>
                  <p>This form of inscription, also occasionally found on some rare early horsemen,<ref target="#CH1-n109">109</ref> not being confined to the type of the seated figure, cannot refer to all these different representations and therefore must be identified with the coin. We shall accordingly read the legend TAPANTINOΣ (νόμος) as on the well known coins of Alexander

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 14D.</hi> The particularly awkward design of this presumably unique oekist, in the Vienna cabinet, makes me suspect that the coin is plated. There is, however, no doubt that Nos. 14C and 14D are strictly contemporary in spite of small differences in the forms of some letters of the inscriptions, especially the letter 0 which is square (◊) on No. 14C, and round on No. 14D. But we know from an early inscription found at Metapontum<ref target="#CH1-n110">110</ref> that both forms ◊ and ○ were at times used simultaneously and indiscriminately in <name type="place">southern Italy</name> during the first years of the fifth century. The ◊, however, is met in no case, after 450 B. C.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Types No. 14E to 14N.</hi> All these not uncommon oekists do not call for any special remark, and it is very probable that many other dies or die-combinations of this rather monotonous series may have escaped my notice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 14N.</hi> So far as I am aware this ugly and barbarous type <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, has never been
<pb n="88"/>
described as a plated coin, though often published by early writers such as Mionnet, de Dominicis and <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name>. The <name type="place">Paris</name> specimen's unusually lightweight (6.37 gr.) is quite sufficient to betray this ancient forgery in spite of the good preservation of its silver coating. On the new example <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> from the same dies, purchased during 1895, by the Berlin cabinet, the interior bronze core is plainly visible on both faces of the coin. The large ill-shaped letters of the ethnic, with the final <graphic url="NNM15_sym1.jpg"/> suppressed, the stiff and poor design of the feet of the seated oekist, with their soles flat on the ground in front of the diphros, are reminiscent of the earlier plated oekist of type No. 8, and this poor imitation of No. 14 may well be the work of the same forger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 14O.</hi> This plated oekist is quite remarkable on account of its very fine style and can only be the work of the same official engraver to whom we owe the normal oekists Nos. 14L to 14M. I am almost certain that the obverse of <name type="pname">Mr. Mavrogordato's</name> unique coin is actually issued from the same die as No. 14M, and
<pb n="89"/>
that, when struck, this plated oekist must have been included in the regular issue, the style and fabric of the coin precluding the possibility of its being the product of a private forger [see also No. 14R]. I shall subsequently draw attention (cf. p. 195) to another plated oekist of a later issue [cf. No. 55], now in my cabinet, struck from the very same pair of dies in use for the normal issue of that type.</p>
                  <p>This disgraceful practice, so dangerous for the coiner, may be the true explanation of the abnormal low weight of a few other oekists which have reached us with their silver plating untouched. It shows the danger of dating coins solely on weight data.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Types Nos. 14P and 14Q.</hi> It is only for comparison's sake that I have reproduced (PI. IV) these two very barbarous plated ancient forgeries. Possibly the plated coin sold at the Bompois, 1882, <name type="place">Paris</name> Sale (lot No. 155), described as exhibiting the seated Demos holding the Palladium (!) in place of the upright distaff, and which I have been unable to trace, may be but an illpreserved example of Nos. 14P or 14Q.</p>
                  <pb n="90"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 14R.</hi> This very rare type which, as we have already noted, shares its obverse die with the wreathed oekist of No. 13, is of very sketchy design and of a weak style similar to that displayed on some late and probably contemporary "hippocamp" nomoi.<ref target="#CH1-n111">111</ref> The excellent preservation of the obverse die shows that this combination of dies was issued before No. 13. The abnormally light weight (5.90 gr.) of the example <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> in my cabinet, which is of ordinary preservation [see Pl. V] and certainly from the same dies as both other known specimens of this type, has led to the discovery that my coin is plated over an unusual core of white metal, probably of lead. <name type="pname">Sir Charles Oman's</name> oekist of this type weighing 7.96 gr., as well as the three known examples of the wreathed issue [No. 13] struck from the same, easily identified, obverse die, are certainly normal and not plated coins. The <name type="place">Naples</name>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n112">112</ref> oekist of No. 14R, disfigured by an ancient chisel-cut on the reverse, may possibly be plated, although Fiorelli does not mention it, as he invariably does in such cases (e. g.
<pb n="91"/>
after his description of the coin No. 1801, in his catalogue: <hi rend="italic">arg. fod.</hi> viz., plated). The inference is somewhat bewildering and probably can find no better explanation than the one offered above for <name type="pname">Mr. J. Mavrogordato's</name> plated oekist of type 14O.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 15.</hi> Unfortunately the two known examples of this new version of the seated oekist, hitherto unpublished, are both in very poor condition.</p>
                  <p>On the de Luynes' coin, however, the oekist's trident is discernible in place of the regal staff; and this extremely rare modification of No. 14, recalling the earlier No. 9, had certainly been detected by the late duke, otherwise he would not have admitted so poorly preserved a coin into his particularly choice collection.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 16.</hi> In 1782, C. Combe first published this poorly preserved nomos in
<pb n="102"/>
his catalogue of the Hunterian collection, as follows: "<hi rend="italic">Figura fere nuda sedens a s. d. tres hordei spicas, s. fusum"</hi> and his highly fanciful and inaccurate engraving of the coin shows the seated oekist holding in his right hand, three disproportionally large ears of com while he is clutching in his left hand a short distaff. <name type="pname">Carellis'</name> figure, taken from Combe's engraving, is equally absurd and misleading. <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name>, however, when referring<ref target="#CH1-n113">113</ref> to this coin, recognized that the seated figure held the usual long staff in his left hand, but did not observe that the supposed ears of corn were only flaws of the die or possibly traces of restriking as suggested to me by <name type="pname">Mr. G. Macdonald</name> after a recent examination of the Hunter coin. That the coin is not restruck is proved by the beautifully preserved nomos which has quite recently come to my notice through the kindness of <name type="pname">Dr. K. Regling</name>. This oekist [Pl. V, 16B], from the same dies as the Hunter example, and exhibiting the identical flaws to the right of the seated oekist, is in the Prince of <name type="pname">Waldeck's</name> splendid collection at <name type="place">Arolsen</name>.
<pb n="103"/>
On this very fine coin we can see clearly that the right hand of Taras is empty. Possibly he extends his hand to receive a small dolphin,<ref target="#CH1-n114">114</ref> unless this too is merely one of the die-flaws that has the fortuitous appearance of a small dolphin swimming downwards from right to left. The <hi rend="italic">soit disant</hi> stems and two other ears of com are certainly only flaws of the die. At any rate the conception of the seated oekist, as patron of the Tarentine harvests,<ref target="#CH1-n115">115</ref> may now be safely dismissed.</p>
                  <p>The reverse die of this type, strikingly recalling the archaic character of No. 14, is certainly the work of the same engraver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 16A.</hi> The community of the obverse die between the apparently unique Nervegna coin and No. 16, shows that the interval betewen their issue must have been slight, but considering the worn condition of this die on No. 16A, there can be no doubt that these two issues are placed here in their proper chronological sequence. We shall again find this obverse die associated with a new reverse [No. 17, Pl. VI] and judging from the occasionally
<pb n="104"/>
fine condition of the die in this third association, it must have been put in use, first concurrently, and then in alternation, with the reverse of No. 16A. The highly interesting reverse die of No. 16A, with the legend TARANTIN⋄Σ, had already been in use for some time with another obverse die on No. 14C [Pl. III], but owing to the not quite satisfactory condition of the three specimens hitherto known, it is impossible to decide which of the issues preceded the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 16B.</hi> When I first published this very interesting and extremely rare variety, eleven years ago, I did not take into account its blurred condition. This is owing to a slip of the die, in the right part of the held of my coin which is otherwise in brilliant condition. I ventured to explain the letter A, placed to the left of Phalanthos, as the abbreviated signature of a mint official or engraver of the coin. The specimen in <name type="pname">Mr. C. Céte's</name> collection, from the same dies, is unfortunately in rather poor condition and rubbed to right of the dolphin rider. This nomos, how
<pb n="105"/>
ever, shows faint traces of the letter T placed opposite the A near the border, and the inscription must be read A∣ T, [TA retrograde] an unusual, though not unique, abbreviation of the ethnic in the early coinage of Tarentum.<ref target="#CH1-n116">116</ref> This reading is confirmed by another extremely rare and hitherto unpublished oekist [see No. 19, Pl. VI] a specimen of which was included in the 1914 find with <name type="pname">Mr. C. Céte's</name> example of No. 16B.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Types Nos. 16C to 16G</hi> are rather common and do not call for any special remarks. Type No. 16E, however, is highly important as sharing its obverse die with the apparently unique wreathed oekist of No. 13A. The condition of this obverse die shows that the wreathed issue was preceded by No. 16E.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 16H.</hi> I have already pointed out the import of the legend TAPA<hi rend="italic">N</hi>TI<hi rend="italic">N</hi>⋄Σ associated with the type of Phalanthos riding the dolphin. The last two letters ⋄Σ of the inscription are clearly legible only on examples <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 16I.</hi> The great interest of
<pb n="106"/>
this remarkably rare type lies in the large cicada<ref target="#CH1-n117">117</ref> which appears in the field of the obverse die, behind Phalanthos above the dolphin. Fiorelli when first publishing the <name type="place">Naples</name> example, on which the symbol is not struck up, added only: <hi rend="italic">dietro simb. incerto.</hi> One must note the minute and realistic skill with which the artist has depicted the membranous, diaphanous wings of the cicada, so clearly recognizable on my fine specimen [see Pl. VI]. The quite exceptional position of this symbol is rather difficult to explain being in contradiction to the unchallenged theory of <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> that at Tarentum before circa 350 B. C. all the symbols—fish, cockle-shell, dolphin, murex, cuttle-fish, cray-fish or crab — placed in the field are in no case associated with the figure of the dolphin rider. "The marine objects may themselves be regarded as an integral part of the type and as representing, like the curling waves that sometimes replace them, at times the little inner sea of Tarentum, at times the open Ionian waters, on the produce of both of which the life and industries
<pb n="107"/>
of the city were so largely dependent."</p>
                  <p>The cicada, however, is a solar symbol often associated with Apollo. The historical founder of Tarentum, Phalanthos, bom at Amyklae,<ref target="#CH1-n118">118</ref> a centre of Mycenaean culture of Laconia, is only a modification of the Delphinian Apollo of Cretan descent,<ref target="#CH1-n119">119</ref> and this quite exceptional cicada-symbol is thus appropriate for the Amykléan Phalanthos. Should this explanation be rejected, we might consider as an alternative that the cicada represents a <hi rend="italic">marque d'atelier,</hi> possibly dedicated or situated near the Temple of the Hyakinthian Apollo of the city.</p>
                  <p>It is highly probable that the several different <hi rend="italic">"botteghe"</hi> or <hi rend="italic">"ateliers"</hi>, of the early Tarentine mint may have been dedicated to the deities and state patrons of the city. I am rather inclined to consider the hitherto unexplained and often conspicuous single letters that appear in the field of the earliest horsemen of late archaic style struck c. 450 B. C., or somewhat earlier [see p. 112] as mint marks of some of
<pb n="108"/>
the Tarentine ateliers (with the exception of Θ, probably an early engraver's signature) the letter <graphic url="NNM15_sym19.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NNM15_sym20.jpg"/> standing for Poseidon,<ref target="#CH1-n120">120</ref> A for Apollo, and T for Taras. Cf. Evans, Pl. II, 2 and 4 with <graphic url="NNM15_sym19.jpg"/>, Evans, PI. II, 5 (with inverted A near the left elbow of Phalanthos), and Evans, PI. II, 1, with T.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 17.</hi> In spite of the very fine workmanship of this rare version of the eponymous hero, this oekist must be included in the present group because its obverse is from the same die as Nos. 16 and 16A. The peculiar position of the right arm and hand of Taras is also found on contemporary types of Rhegium and shows clearly the influence of early fifth century Attic models.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 17A.</hi> This type, very similar to that preceding, is much more common but of equal merit, and both these reverse dies may well be the work of the same artist.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 18.</hi> The <name type="place">Naples</name> oekist seems to be unique, but owing to its defective striking it is impossible to ascertain if this nomos is a replica of Nos. 17 and 17A or

a modification of the following No. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 19.</hi> This extremely rare oekist happily confirms the reading of the unusual form of the ethnic A ∣ T, separated by the type, submitted for No. 16B, the letter T being very distinct on the original in my collection [cf. Pl. VI, 19a].</p>

               <head>PERIOD III</head>
               <p>Circa B. C. 460-443.</p>
               <p>It must of course be understood that the time limits assigned to this period are only approximate. There is no historical information for this interval that can supply any help in our classification. It will however hardly be doubted that it is in the years immediately following c. 460 B. C., that the first issues of Tarentine nomoi with the horseman, of very early transitional style, finally superseded the latest hippocamp and youthful head reverses. These were probably struck during certain agonistic festivities, together with the oekists, some of which are combined with strikingly
<pb n="110"/>
similar obverse dies.<ref target="#CH1-n121">121</ref> I have not been able to trace any early horseman actually sharing the same παράσημου die with an oekist, though, it is well known,<ref target="#CH1-n122">122</ref> that some "wheel" and "archaic youthful head" nomoi have the same obverse die in common. I have in my collection two nomoi of early transitional style, one with the hippocamp, the other with the head of Satyra, both struck from the same obverse die. We may therefore surmise that the oekists and the contemporary early horsemen were probably issued in different <hi rend="italic">ateliers</hi>. The style and morphological succession of their obverse types are unquestionably similar in both series, and there can be little doubt of their contemporaneity. This is also confirmed at times by epigraphic evidence, and by the contents of well-known finds such as the <name type="place">Paestum</name> (1858) and the 1864 Calabrian hoards<ref target="#CH1-n123">123</ref> which included, side by side, oekists and very early horsemen equally well preserved.</p>
               <p>The following oekists can be classified according to the data obtained from their
<pb n="111"/>
die-combinations. There must also be taken into account, criteria based on the development of their workmanship which progresses rapidly from transitional to early fine style during the first ten years proposed for their issue.</p>
               <p>The oekists of this period are characterized by an increased delicacy in rendering details and by a truer understanding of the anatomical structure of the human body, combined with a greater freedom of movement. Towards the end of this issue we shall observe the first artless attempts to render true linear perspective in the representation of the four-legged diphros.<ref target="#CH1-n124">124</ref>
               </p>
               <p>On the oekists of this third period, the double circle border enclosing a ring of beads or pellets, has wholly disappeared. This border, however, is found on many of the earliest horsemen such as Type Ai [Evans, Period I, Pl. II, I] or BI [Evans, Period II, Pl. II, 4] with the same "mint mark" <graphic url="NNM15_sym20.jpg"/> as the architype of the horsemen BI [Evans, Period I, PI.

The horseman of this type published by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name>, PI. II, 4, struck on a small flan, does not show the early border surrounding the obverse type.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Types Nos. 20 and 20A.</hi> I am inclined to date the issue of this type immediately after the striking of the earliest horsemen of Type A1 and B1, <name type="pname">cf. Sir Arthur Evan's</name> First Period, which suggest very primitive art, and were, in my opinion, struck possibly even earlier than 460 B. C., in spite of the epigraphic evidence pointing to a somewhat later date. The inscriptions carefully noted on all the oekists of my Second Period are varied at random, and show, as already noted, the unreliableness of epigraphy as a criterion at Tarentum during the greater part of the fifth century. [cf. <ref target="#fig-6">Fig. No. 4</ref>.]</p>
                  <p>The long use of the obverse die of No. 20, (found coupled with at least four reverse dies), provides us with valuable criteria for placing other closely connected types of oekists in their probable chronological succession.</p>
                  <p>The seated hero on the reverse, strongly recalls No. 19 of the preceding Period, and is of a slightly more advanced transitional
<pb n="128"/>
style. The oekist's figure has lost much of its rigidity especially on the somewhat later No. 20B struck when the obverse die shows unmistakeable signs of long striking. These oekists are all very rare and are not mentioned by either Carelli or <name type="pname">R. Rochette.</name> Their style is rather weak and closely agrees with that of one of the early horsemen depicted by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> [Pl. II, 3, 9 and Pl. XI, 1 ], and others<ref target="#CH1-n126">126</ref> which have come to light since 1889. That all belong to these early issues is proved by their die-combinations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 21.</hi> This last utilization of the obverse die, now badly damaged, with a new version of the heroized oekist, considering the rarity of the type, must have been quite exceptional, and is, I believe, only a mule of No. 31 described hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Types Nos. 22, 23 and 24.</hi> These three oekists share the same obverse die on which Phalanthos holds in his right hand a strigil. The <name type="place">Naples</name> and Aberdeen coins of the first two types appear to be unique, all three are certainly the work of
<pb n="129"/>
the same engraver. This obverse die comes in use again during Period IV on Nos. 56 and 56A.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Types Nos. 25, 25A.</hi> This rather common type is only a revival of the monotonous version so frequently met during the previous period but now displaying the same weak transitional style noted above. The only interest of this type lies in the exceptional transfer of the seated oekist's type to the obverse die, and in its rather flat and spread fabric also to be noticed on the following very rare contemporary types Nos. 26 to 34.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 26.</hi> The obverse of this type like Nos. 22, 24, presents the legend TAPA<hi rend="italic">N</hi>TI<hi rend="italic">NΩN</hi>, with the Ω in place of O and is of a remarkably advanced style for the period. The cockle-shell symbol is an exquisite representation of the<hi rend="italic">Pecten-Jacobés,</hi> much appreciated even today by the inhabitants of modern <name type="place">Taranto</name> under the name of <hi rend="italic">Pettine.</hi> The appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Ω</hi> in the inscription at this early date can be explained by the commercial relations of the Spartan City with Ionia and its

                     <name type="pname">Magna Grécian</name> colony of Velia, whose earliest coinage, from c. 500 B.

                  <p>I have in my collection a second example of this remarkable horseman from the same dies, showing quite clearly the earlier
<pb n="131"/>
form R of the inscription on the reverse. The Berlin example of this type [Dressel, 1. c., p. 242, No. 95] confirms this reading, though the coin is somewhat worn, and the end of inscription obliterated.<ref target="#CH1-n128">128</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 27.</hi> This oekist which shares the same obverse die with No. 26 shows strong Attic influence and makes one think of this figure as a slightly older type of those youthful gods seated in the east frieze of the <name type="place">Parthenon</name>. <ref target="#CH1-n129">129</ref> The himation is no longer represented with stiff formal folds. We can now trace an effort at freedom in the smaller folds made by the movement of the legs, while the larger folds still retain the conventional form.</p>
                  <p>It must be noted here that the beautiful example depicted on Pl. VIII, 27<hi rend="italic">a</hi> has in the field to right of the oekist's elbow the letter <graphic url="NNM15_sym21.jpg"/> of an early form incised (graffito). I have been able to trace this letter A generally shaped <graphic url="NNM15_sym12.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NNM15_sym21.jpg"/> on many oekists that have passed through my hands [No. 13 <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> No. 14R <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, No. 16C <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> No. 26 <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> No. 56A <hi rend="italic">c].</hi> This letter A is probably only the initial of A[NAΘAMA], showing
<pb n="132"/>
that these coins were dedicated as offerings for a special religious purpose in the temples of one of the gods or state patrons, the character of the incised letter apparently precluding the reading of <hi rend="bold">A</hi> for <hi rend="bold">A [EθΛON]</hi> or prize money as on the celebrated Metapontine coin though, should this last interpretation perchance be the right one. our oekists would be a most becoming prize for the winners of games instituted in the honor of the two principal Tarentine state patrons: Taras and Phalanthos.</p>
                  <p>Owing to the exceptional low weight of the example <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of this type, 6.58 gr., <name type="pname">Dr. K. Regling</name> dates it c. 281 B. C., after the reduction of the Tarentine nomos to about 6.80 gr. on the basis of the Roman six-scruple standard.<ref target="#CH1-n130">130</ref> This extraordinarily low weight should receive the explanation proposed for <name type="pname">Mr. J. Mavrogordato's</name> plated oekist. [Type 140.] <name type="pname">Mr. E. P. Warren</name> has kindly informed me that he cannot now trace this coin at Lewes House, and as it is not to be found in the <name type="pname">Boston</name> Museum of Fine Arts, it has been impossible for me to secure a cast in order to ascertain
<pb n="133"/>
if it was actually struck from the dies of No. 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 28.</hi> This oekist without the cockle-shell beneath the dolphin seems to be quite unique. In other respects it is very similar to our No. 20A. The coin is very poorly preserved and of very weak transitional style.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 29.</hi> This highly interesting type, also in the Santangelo collection at <name type="place">Naples</name>, is presumably unique and hitherto known only from <name type="pname">Carellis'</name> engraving which is very inaccurate owing to the very poor condition of the coin.</p>
                  <p>The usual cockle-shell is here replaced by a very realistic murex-shell <hi rend="italic">(tritonium nodiferum)</hi> known today at <name type="place">Taranto</name> under the popular name of <hi rend="italic">Buccino.</hi> The obverse type is surrounded by a linear border <hi rend="italic">incuse</hi>, unique in all the Tarantine series. The <hi rend="italic">tritonium nodiferum</hi> must not be confused with the true purple-shell or <hi rend="italic">Murex brandaris</hi>, of which an exquisite representation is to be found on the earliest gold stater,<ref target="#CH1-n131">131</ref> struck at Tarentum. It also figures on one of the Tarentine nomoi with
<pb n="134"/>
the head of Nymph Satyra on the reverse, which may be dated a few years earlier than our oekist. Garrucci's representation of this extraordinarily rare nomos, Pl. XCVII, 17, taken from the Bunbury specimen now in my cabinet,<ref target="#CH1-n132">132</ref> is very inaccurate as one can judge from the <ref target="#fig-7">Fig. No. 5</ref>.

Phalanthos is represented holding an olive wreath, perchance commemorating a victory of the Tarentines over the Peuketians. He is dishevelled and ithyphallic, possibly a punning allusion to his name (φαλλός, φάλανθος).</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 31.</hi> This remarkable type shows a bold attempt to render perspective for such an early date. On No. 29 the diecutter had drawn the two back legs of the diphros in perspective [cf. Pl. VIII], but this rather pretentious new type is somewhat unbalanced, and it is evident that the engraver failed to place the diphros perpendicular to the exergue, thus destroying the equipoise of the seated oekist [cf. Pl. VII]. The footstool (θρῆνυς) is uncomfortably high. This stool, ornamented with lion's feet, has been taken by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur</name> for an Ionic capital and explained as a visible emblem of heroization. There are however, other redeeming points in this elaborate version of the seated Taras.

The skilful rendering of the folds of his himation is unrivalled for such an early issue. As noted above this reverse is also used with the much earlier obverse die on No. 21 [cf. Pl. VI,] which, owing to the condition of that old die, I proposed to consider as a mule.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 33.</hi> This splendid type is one of the masterpieces of the Tarantine mint. The heroic character is deliberately emphasized by the appearance of a sepulchral altar or tomb before which the heroized oekist is engaged in a solemn sacrifice as though occupied with the sacred rites without which no Greek city was founded.<ref target="#CH1-n133">133</ref>

The site of this tomb has been identified, with great probability by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> and Signor Viola,<ref target="#CH1-n134">134</ref> as an eminence bordering the ancient walls of Tarentum not far from the Témenid gate.

                  </p>
                  <p>The oekist has again been transferred to the obverse die, no doubt in order to protect the high relief. However, a small break in the die, near the end of the distaff [see Pl. VIII, 33<hi rend="italic">a</hi>] must have occurred almost as soon as the die was put into service. It rapidly increased in size impairing the beauty of many examples that have reached
<pb n="138"/>
us. It is owing to this break that the distaff has at times been described<ref target="#CH1-n138">138</ref> and engraved as an oar, [cf. Magnan, 1. c., T. I. Tab. 39, No. XVIII, Pl. VIII, 33<hi rend="italic">b</hi>] or as the raised back of the diphros [cf. Pl. VIII, 33<hi rend="italic">i</hi>]. I cannot agree with the opinion expressed by the late <name type="pname">Dr. H. Dressel</name> that the type of the reverse is of somewhat earlier style.<ref target="#CH1-n139">139</ref> The drawing of the figure, in true perspective, is most life-like, and his hair streaming in the breeze is one of the first hints of the <hi rend="italic">argutiae minutiarum</hi> which later attains to such perfection on the Tarantine dies. However, the dotted border surrounding the obverse type is an early feature, associated with many of the contemporary horsemen. It gives place on the subsequent oekist issues to a plain linear border.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 34.</hi> This type, one of the very finest representations of the heroized oekist, shows a remarkable advance in style. The poise of the seated figure, and the delicately elaborated composition of the drapery, suggest again the influence of Attic marble reliefs and resemble in a remarkable
<pb n="139"/>
way the Parthenon frieze. This almost purely Pheidian style apparently would indicate a somewhat later date of issue than the one proposed for the end of Period III.</p>
                  <p>A close and repeated examination of the obverse die, has led me to the conviction that this type is struck from the very same die as the one used for Nos. 26 and 27 [see Pl. VIII] after a careful recutting. The engraver has greatly improved the figure and arms of Phalanthos and recut his waist, unduly narrow on Nos. 26, 27. The practice of recutting old dies at Tarentum is undeniable from the very start of its coinage. I have in my collection three incuse nomoi all struck from the same obverse die (easily identified from several small breaks) each specimen showing successive stages of the recutting. The large square mark on the reverse [see <ref target="#fig-7">Fig. No. 5</ref>] in the field to right of the head of Satyra has been cut into the old die after a first issue of this remarkable type before the addition of the mark of value,<ref target="#CH1-n140">140</ref> indicating that this nomos was the unit or stater.
<pb n="140"/>
The rather early date proposed here for No. 34 is apparently further corroborated by the evidence of the 1914 find which included an example of this type in fine condition. The analysis of the coins of this small hoard shows, as will be seen in Appendix C, that its deposition could hardly have been later than c. 440 B. C.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 35.</hi> This unique example, with the obverse type turned to left, is plated over a bronze core and probably was intended to imitate the preceding No. 34. Unfortunately, the coin being of small flan, a great part of the seated oekist, which is of unusually good style for an ancient forgery, is lost and cannot be examined with any detail.</p>
                  <p>Carelli gives, Plate CVI, 55, the engraving of an extraordinary type which can be described as follows:</p>

                  <p>
                     <name type="pname">L. Sambon,</name> probably following Carelli, describes an oekist p. 239, in his well-known <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les Monnaies de la presqu'éle Italique</hi>, under No. 30, as follows: <hi rend="italic">"il pose le pied droit sur une proue de navire"</hi> Finding it impossible to trace any example answering to the above descriptions I consulted my late friend <name type="pname">Dr. Imhoof-Blumer</name>, whose experience has always been placed most willingly at the disposal of numismatists, but he informed ‘me that he had never met a Tarentine oekist anything like <name type="pname">Carellis'</name> engraving.</p>
                  <p>It is by mere chance that I found quite recently the source from which Carelli had copied this incongruous type, while examining the very obsolete plates of Goltzius' <hi rend="italic">Sicilia et Magna Grécia, sive his torié urbium et populorum Graecié</hi> published at Bruges in 1576.

                  <p>The Greau sale catalogue (1867) mentions under lot No. 287 the following coin "<hi rend="italic">Sans legende?

I believe that the version of the seated Taras as patron of the Tarentine fleet, may safely be discarded as one of the countless inventions of the wholly unreliable Goltzius.</p>

               <head>PERIOD IV</head>
               <p>Circa B. C. 443-400</p>
               <p>The approximate date of 443 B. C. proposed as a limit for the oekists of our Third Period, is the date of the foundation of Thurium. Erected on a site not far removed from the ruins of Sybaris, Thurium was established by the Athenians in the hope that the new city would take the place and importance of the former Achaean colony. Fearing that the newly founded city might ally itself with the Achaeans of Metapontum and the bordering Lucanians who, during the middle of the fifth century, had greatly extended southward their incursions to the prejudice of the peaceful énotrians, the Tarentines decided to seize the territory between Thurium and Metapontum, formerly belonging to Siris, a city which had been destroyed by the Achéans of Metapontum, Sybaris and Croton [B. C. 560]; and to establish there a fortress to hold all their foes, whether Greek or Lucanian, at check. War for the possession of Siris was waged on land and sea; the
<pb n="144"/>
Thurian armies were led by a Spartan exile named Cleandridas. Hostilities lasted about fourteen years, but finally the victorious Tarentines obtained a favourable treaty of peace, giving them possession of the coveted territory but allowing to the Thurians many privileges. One result was the foundation of Heraclea [B. C. 432], a joint colony of Tarentum and Thurium, a few miles further inland than the old Siris. The Tarentines thus reduced Metapontum almost to vassalage.</p>
               <p>The progress in style displayed by the last oekist-issues, grouped under Period IV, is most remarkable and the engraver's art reaches a level almost unrivalled in the subsequent Tarentine series.</p>
               <p>Side by side with the evident influence of Attic models of purely Pheidian style, we now find on many new versions of the seated Taras a pictorial element suggestive of the painters' rather than the sculptors' art. It is impossible not to accept <name type="pname">Lenormant's</name> view recently accepted by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n141">141</ref> that the pictorial style on all the more or less contemporary coin
<pb n="145"/>
types of Magna Grécia, was due to the influence of the great painter Zeuxis who during the last quarter of the fifth century B. C. had made Croton the centre of his activity.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately most of the finest types of the Tarentine oekists have been copied by native engravers of very slight skill, and we find many examples of carelessness and want of finish. This is also to be observed, even during the best period, at Terina, Metapontum and in other Magna Grécian mints. That the oekists of Tarentine Greek style and those of poor workmanship are to be grouped together as strictly contemporary, is fully corroborated by the evidence of the small but highly important 1914 find from the immediate neighborhood of <name type="place">Taranto</name>. I was fortunate enough to be able to examine this find in its integrity before its dispersion, and can give its analysis (Appendix C). All the coins were more or less coated with a tenacious greyish oxide. The removal of this coating left the surface of many of the coins somewhat eroded. It is noteworthy that
<pb n="146"/>
no early horsemen were included in this small find, but negative evidence proves nothing and it is now conceded that many early equestrian nomoi were issued before oekists of advanced style as Nos. 34, 37<hi rend="sup">A</hi> and 42, and all three of these were represented in this find by very fine or brilliant specimens.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> has expressed the opinion that between the early horsemen of his First Period (c. 450-430 B. C.) and those he has described under his Second Period (c. 420-380 B. C.), the Tarentine moneyers had stopped the striking of the equestrian types and had reverted to the precedent oekist-issues; and <name type="pname">Dr. K. Regling</name> shares the same opinion even extending from 450 to 430 B. C., the interval between the first two horsemen Periods.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt that after c. 430 B. C., the oekist-nomoi must have formed the principal staple of the Tarentine currency, but since 1889 when <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> published his monograph, many new equestrian types of late transitional to early fine style have come to light which lessen the lapse
<pb n="147"/>
noticed by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> in the artistic development between horsemen of his Periods I and II. Apparently this disturbing gap is now satisfactorily filled. Most of these new horsemen are unpublished. They show so many affinities in design and such great similarity in the style of their die-cutting with many oekists of the Fourth Period, that it is difficult to date them as late as 420 B. C. I am therefore very much inclined to believe that both oekists and horsemen continued to be struck, side by side, from 430 until c. 400 B. C., when the equestrian types permanently displaced the seated oekist. This conclusion receives corroboration from the evidence supplied by the very important hoard of 1908, from the Ionian Calabrian shore (?) of which I can give but a summary, from notes taken during 1910 (Appendix A), when I had the opportunity of hurriedly looking through this find which had passed into the hands of a prominent dealer. The five oekists included therein were in exactly the same condition of preservation as the bulk of the horsemen belonging to the first two Periods
<pb n="148"/>
represented in this remarkable hoard, and their contemporaneity was obvious.</p>
               <p>The weight standard of the oekists during their last issues is now somewhat lower and the average weight proposed by <name type="pname">Dr. K. Regling</name> of 7.73 gr. is correct, though some exceptional pieces noted weigh 8.14 and even 8.20 gr. We also find certain issues [see No. 37] represented by examples in brilliant mint state, weighing as little as 7.63 gr.</p>

series, a real masterpiece of skilful equipoise and harmonious simplicity. This new version of the seated Taras holding a bird, probably a dove, by the tips of its wings, finds a parallel on many vase-paintings principally on Attic sepulchral white lekythoi dating c. 480 to 450 B. C. That the dove may have been connected with the cult of the heroized Taras is probable from its appearance on several extremely rare, new divisions of the Tarentine nomos struck under Attic influence after the foundation of Thurium. We have already noted a dove (cf. note No. 67a.) with flapping wings, seated beneath the sacred diphros, on a trihemiobol probably belonging to the same issue as our No. 37. On the reverse of contemporary obols with the head of Taras on the obverse, we find the representation of a dove-cote, at times represented facing—at times seen sideways.<ref target="#CH1-n142">142</ref> The extravagant explanation of Taras holding the dove, given by Cavedoni in his <hi rend="italic">Spiceligio Numismatico</hi>, (a punning allusion between TAPΣOΣ, the end of the bird's feathers, and the name of
<pb n="179"/>
TAPAΣ), is fanciful and must be rejected. This charming version of the seated oekist can refer only to the old heroic cult of Taras. The association of the dove with the soul is much later in its origin and is too well known to be inquired into here.<ref target="#CH1-n143">143</ref>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 37A.</hi> This extraordinarily rare variety is distinctly ungraceful and of unpleasing style, in spite of redeeming points of merit such as the treatment of the himation's folds and the bold foreshortening of the seated oekist's left foot. We have here a typical example of the work of a second-rate engraver, possibly of MessapoIapygian origin. The prawn on the obverse is almost barbarous compared to the lifelike model as figured on the master die.</p>
                  <p>The three small pellets, placed around Phalanthos in the field of the obverse are, however, a highly interesting new feature and can only be intended for marks of value. No doubt they indicate that the Tarentine nomos should be accepted in exchange of three Achaean thirds of stater, a wholly abnormal<ref target="#CH1-n144">144</ref> division in the Tarentine silver series, though used very frequently

at Metapontum; and we have seen, in the preceding historical summary, how closely related were Tarentum and Metapontum during the middle of the fifth century B.C. The brilliantly preserved specimen figured on Pl. IX. (Wt. 8.14 gr.) is the most recent oekist type represented in the 1914 hoard, buried probably not later than c. 440 B. C.</p>
                  <p>The obverse die is found in use with two other reverse dies on No. 42 [cf. Pl. X] and the unique No. 54.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 37B.</hi> The unusually light weight (6. 91gr.) and the very poor style of this curious oekist, formerly in the Lébbecke collection, make me suspect that this hitherto unpublished variety may possibly be an ancient, plated, forgery. Otherwise this oekist must have been minted by the Messapo-Iapygians at Luppia or Sallentium. The weight of similar barbarous imitations [cf. Types 42<hi rend="italic">a</hi>, 52A.<hi rend="italic">a</hi>, 59C, 59D] generally, is very inaccurate, ranging from 8.10 gr. to 5.95 gr.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 37C.</hi> The style of this apparently unique variety is also poor and
<pb n="181"/>
the features of the seated Taras, with his very large nose, strongly recall the profile of Phalanthos on the obverse of No. 37A.</p>
                  <p>The compiler of the G. Sim sale catalogue describing this coin calls the object, held by Taras in his extended right hand, "a barbed hook with dolphin." A careful examination of the original shows that the engraver has really represented on this variety, in place of the usual bird, a fish, turned to left, held in a small net. It is, however, very probable that this fish is only the blundered representation of a dove's body with the head lacking, and that the ignorant engraver misunderstood the bird for a fish, owing to the fact that the dove's upturned head is very often off the flan on many specimens [cf. Strozzi Sale Cat., Pl. III, No. 842]. Avellino in a letter, quoted by <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name>, describes an oekist in the <name type="place">Naples</name> Cabinet<ref target="#CH1-n145">145</ref> on which Taras holds <hi rend="italic">"dextra, parvum rete in quo piscis",</hi> and L. Sambon very probably refers to the same type when writing (his No. 34) <hi rend="italic">"Il tient un petit filet oil se trouve un poisson</hi>."</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 38.</hi> In order to give a complete representation of this rare and extremely beautiful type, I have given (Pl. IX) the photographs of four examples each one completing the other, as unfortunately the only brilliantly preserved specimen, the one from my collection, has its reverse type poorly centred. This striking version of the seated oekist offering a dove to a young panther's cub is markedly pictorial in character and must be compared to some of the finest contemporary products of the Terinéan and Pandosian mints on which the influence of the great Italiote painter Zeuxis is manifest.<ref target="#CH1-n146">146</ref> The young animal, leaping at the dove, looks like a cat, and <name type="pname">Lenormant</name>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n147">147</ref> referring to this type, has written a very interesting chapter in order to demonstrate that outside of Egypt, the Tarentines were the first to domesticate the cat; but it has now been well established by <name type="pname">Prof. O. Keller</name> and others<ref target="#CH1-n148">148</ref> that the cat did not become a domestic pet in <name type="place">Europe</name> until later. The close connection of the heroized Taras with the Chthonic Dionysos is well established.</p>
                  <pb n="183"/>
                  <p>It marks the influence of a Dionysiac cult superimposed on that of the eponymous founder, and is sufficient to explain his association with the panthers cub.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 38A.</hi> This apparently unique variety is of poor style and possibly the work of the second-rate die-cutter who engraved Nos. 37A and 37C. On this reverse die the finely drawn stool placed beneath the right foot of Taras [cf. Pl. IX], on the master-die, is represented by an almost meaningless curved line.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 39.</hi> This unpublished and possibly unique oekist is unfortunately very much rubbed and in such poor condition that even an accurate description of the reverse type is out of the question. Taras is represented for the first time quite naked, and Dionysos-like he apparently strokes the panther's head. The traces of what may be a lemniskos show beneath his left elbow, but this object may be but a fold of his himation, hidden by his chair, and only partly visible over his right thigh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 40.</hi> The instantaneous character of this very rare and picturesque
<pb n="184"/>
variety immediately strikes the eye. The young panther, placed in the field behind the seated Taras, has seen or scented the dove, held in the oekist's right hand, and is about to spring forward. This highly pictorial composition is a <hi rend="italic">tableau de genre</hi> and the real counterpart of No. 38. Unfortunately only the very poor specimen in the Berlin cabinet [cf. Pl. IX, 40<hi rend="italic">b]</hi> shows clearly the dove held by Taras.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 41.</hi> On this very rare version of unusually charming style, the seated hero holds, in place of the dove, on the back of his extended right hand a small spindle twined with wool at which the young panther, now turned to left, is about to spring. What an expression of the sinister attraction that a spool of wool has for playful kittens!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 42.</hi> There can be little doubt that this reverse die, offering the same version as the preceding type, but of poorer style, is the work of the same die-cutter who engraved the obverse die of this extraordinarily rare type. Strange to say the spindle of wool, placed on the back of
<pb n="185"/>
the seated oekist's hand, is more clearly drawn on this replica than on the masterdie. It disposes of the fanciful interpretations of this symbol hitherto offered by Carelli, James Millingen, <name type="pname">R. Rochette</name> and myself, when describing it as a murex or fish. The extremely fine example, 42a of Pl. X, from the 1914 find, shares the same obverse die with No. 37A, thus corroborating the classification proposed for all the preceding varied issues of fine style. [Nos. 37 to 41].</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 43.</hi> This very scarce type which is the last to share the now very much worn obverse die, which we have found associated with four other reverses [Nos. 38, 39, 40 and 41] represents the seated Taras holding the spindle of wool downwards. Judging from the expectant expression of the seated oekist's gracefully inclined head, the absence of the panther is somewhat surprising and this version may be better explained when compared with the previous Nos. 40 and 41.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 44.</hi> No doubt <name type="pname">Mr. Arthur Sambon</name>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n149">149</ref> is right in ascribing this unique
<pb n="186"/>
and very barbarous type to the mint of Luppia or Sallentium. The Messapo-Iapygian style and fabric are characteristic and unmistakable on this very curious imitation combining details taken from several contemporary reverse types.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 45.</hi> This obverse type is of a somewhat archaistic, conventional style. The large, naturalistic cockle-shell, as well as the perfect design of the dolphin, preclude the possibility of an earlier issue, and the immediate utilization of the reverse die with the following No. 46 confirms that the purported archaic style of Phalanthos on the obverse die, is due to a mannered archaistic affectation. The rather uncomfortable position of the forward-leaning figure, on the reverse die, with the footstool placed at an impossible angle, gives to this otherwise very carefully engraved version, an appearance of top-heaviness that recalls the somewhat earlier Nos. 31 and 32 [cf. Pl. VII] of Period III, undoubtedly the work of the same engraver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 46.</hi> The new martial attitude of Phalanthos who wears a crested
<pb n="187"/>
Athenian helmet and who is armed with the Tarentine circular shield and two lances, while he extends in his right hand the akrostolion, offers a clear allusion to the termination of the long war between Tarentum and Thurium for the possession of the territory of ancient Siris. In my opinion this type must have been struck c. 432 B. C. to commemorate the foundation of Heraclea, the Athenian helmet being a reference to the peaceful understanding between the two cities.</p>
                  <p>Beneath the dolphin a large fish is to be seen swimming to the left, (cf. also Types 47B and 48). A visit to the <name type="place">Naples</name> aquarium clearly demonstrated to me that this fish is the <hi rend="italic">serranus gigas</hi> which is often to be seen even now on the <name type="place">Taranto</name> fish market, and much sought for under the name of <hi rend="italic">cernia.</hi> Previously <name type="pname">Dr. Imhoof-Blumer</name> and <name type="pname">Dr. Keller</name>

                     <pb n="188"/>
is identical in all its details with the coins' presentation.</p>

                  <p>This remarkable type is signed by the engraver with a microscopical "E" on the lower part of the dolphin's body, and even the late <name type="pname">Prof. Von Sallet</name>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n151">151</ref> was inclined to regard this E as the initial of an artist's name. As already noted, the reverse die of this exceedingly rare type had been utilized with a very different obverse die on No. 45.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 47.</hi> Nos. 47 to 49 take high rank among the most beautiful of all Greek coins and are unsurpassed in elegance of design and exquisite delicacy of work.</p>
                  <p>The seated Taras extending a spindle twined with wool to the playful panther's cub, holds in his left hand a strigil and lekythos or oil flask of the ary ball os type
<pb n="189"/>
with the regular trumpet-mouth, narrow neck, and almost spherical body. These small vases were always utilized by athletes for oil anointings after palestra-exercise following the<ref target="#CH1-n152">152</ref> use of the strigil (<hi rend="italic">Ξύστρου</hi>) to remove dust and sweat. The strigil tied together with the lekythos was known under the name of <hi rend="italic">Ξυστρολήκνθον</hi>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n153">153</ref> and it is natural to find Taras holding these athletic accessories, so much used during games instituted in his honor. It is more than probable that the foundation of Heraclea must have been celebrated by the Tarantines with the revival of some religious celebration of an agonistic character closely connected with the heroes and state patrons of the city. Type No. 47, on which the trammels of archaic convention are still felt, appears to be quite unique. Unfortunately the coin is not in the best of preservation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 47A.</hi> That the seated oekist held the small aryballos, suspended with the strigil by a string from his left wrist, is ascertained by this coin, formerly in the <name type="pname">Garrucci</name> collection. Its poor style
<pb n="190"/>
shows that it is probably only a plated imitation of the oekist in my cabinet [cf. Pl. X, 47].</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 47B.</hi> This very beautiful type must have been struck c. 430 B. C. and is contemporary with the splendid first issue of nomoi minted at Heraclea, representing on the reverse, Heracles naked, reclining on the rocks and holding a wine cup in his right hand. The usual assumption that this thoroughly Attic conception belongs to the fourth century is untenable,<ref target="#CH1-n154">154</ref> and these rare nomoi must be dated immediately after the founding of the city.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 48.</hi> Unfortunately none of the three known examples of this extraordinarily beautiful type is in fine condition. The truly Pheidian style of this type bears an unmistakable resemblance to that of the Parthenon frieze; and the wonderful foreshortening of the seated oekist's legs closely wrapped in the beautifully executed folds of the clinging himation, does not find a parallel short of the Terinaean masterpiece of the artist, representing the
<pb n="191"/>
nymph seated on the overturned hydria,<ref target="#CH1-n155">155</ref> (struck c. 425 B. C.). This reverse type shares the same obverse die with No. 47B, signed by the artist E who is possibly also the engraver of the beautiful reverse die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 49.</hi> The following series of oekists [Nos. 49 to 53D] have been grouped together as sharing a similar obverse die on which Phalanthos is represented holding a large shield of Mycenaean or Minoan shape usually improperly termed Béotian, a fitting symbol for the Amykléan-bom hero.</p>
                  <p>The seated Taras on the reverse of No. 49 is represented entirely naked, holding in his right hand a distaff and giving wing to a very small bird. This highly picturesque version was probably suggested by the contemporary Terinéan coinage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 50.</hi> This new and very fine version of the mythic founder seated with his legs crossed, holding his royal staff, has been closely copied on one of the finest Rhegian dies,<ref target="#CH1-n156">156</ref> struck c. 420–416 B. C., thus giving us an approximate date for this Tarentine ékist.</p>
                  <pb n="192"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 51.</hi> On this rare die, Taras holds a small bird having its feet tied with a lemniskos. This apparently confirms <name type="pname">R. Rochette's</name> suggestion that similar types refer to a custom, described by Athenéus. During games and festivities, doves and other birds were liberated after having had their feet tied with lemniskoi, so that they might be easily caught by the spectators. "Έκ τЬντον περιστεραι κaθ' φάσσαι κaθ τρυγονεδ κθι." [Athen. V, p. 200C.]</p>
                  <p>The poor condition of the obverse die shows that this very pretty type must be dated among the latest of the oekist issues; and the presence of a very fine example of this type in the 1908 find points to the same conclusion. A white sepulchral Attic lekythos, in the Elgin collection,<ref target="#CH1-n157">157</ref> is adorned with a strikingly similar representation.</p>
                  <p>The painting represents a fine female figure, holding a bird in her right hand. Seated on a chair, in front of a stele, she has the grace of the goddesses of the
<pb n="193"/>
Parthenon frieze and of the Hegeso of the well-known stele.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Types Nos. 52, 52A.</hi> The oekist No. 52 hitherto unpublished, is interesting as having been copied by the Messapo-Iapygians in a very ugly and barbarous style: Only two examples of these curious imitations have reached us, No. 52A,—both of unusually low weight [5.98 and 5.95 gr.] precluding the possibility of their currency at Tarentum. They were probably struck for local use at Luppia or Sallentum.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Types Nos. 53 to 57 and Nos. 59 to 59E.</hi> The rather monotonous new version of Taras seated on his diphros, balancing the distaff on the back of his extended right hand, while he holds in his left, at times the strigil and lekythos, at other times the lekythos alone, and in one case [No. 56A] nothing, is among the most common reverse types in the whole series; and taking into consideration the large number of extant specimens, these ékists must have been issued for a rather extended period. Both the 1908 hoard and the small Torre del Ovo find (1918) show that these types,
<pb n="194"/>
not represented in the 1914 <name type="place">Taranto</name> deposit, were certainly among the latest issued. The style of these coins and of many horsemen (cf. Evans', Period II), is strikingly similar. A close comparison between the oekist, 53D (Pl. XII), and the horsemen, Evans Pl. II, 10, or 53C. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and Evans Pl. II. 8, shows such close affinity in design that the same handiwork may be suspected in both cases. In my description of the very slight variations of these types I have followed as much as possible their somewhat intricate die-combinations, only a few of which call for any special notice. No. 53B is remarkably ugly and of very poor style but must be certainly contemporaneous with the reverses of Nos. 53 and 53A, of fine style, sharing with them the same obverse die. [cf. Plates XI and XII.]</p>
                  <p>No. 53D [cf. Pl. XII], from the Lébbecke collection, now in the Berlin Cabinet is of very beautiful style and probably the prototype of the whole series.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 55.</hi> The condition of the obverse die of this rather common variety shows its long service. It was first utilized
<pb n="195"/>
with the beautiful reverse of No. 37 [cf. Pls. VIII and IX]. The strigil, held by Phalanthos, is now almost obliterated by wear [cf. 55a, 556, 55A]. The prawn, beneath the dolphin, is barely recognizable. It has been taken for a small dolphin by R. Rochette and others. On the reverse, the seated Taras is of unusually corpulent proportions and the type may well commemorate some agonistic festival. I have already mentioned on p. 89, when discussing No. 14O, the remarkable fact that one of the examples of Type 55 in my cabinet, 55<hi rend="italic">b</hi> on PI. XII, in brilliant condition though not quite struck up, is plated and struck from the very same obverse and reverse dies as all the normal examples issued from the same die-combination that have come under my notice. So high an authority as Mr. E. T. Newell, while in Marseilles, after submitting my plated coin to a careful examination, fully agreed with the above surprising conclusion. This may also explain the abnormally low weight of No. 27 <hi rend="italic">h.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Types Nos. 56, 56A.</hi> There is no doubt
<pb n="196"/>
that the obverse die of these two very late types is the identical one used during Period III with three different reverses, described under Nos. 22, 23, 24 [cf. Pl. VII]. In fact I had at first felt inclined to bring down the three latter types to Period IV, and to consider them as late revivals of the much earlier Nos. 16 and 20 of transitional style. I have finally and somewhat reluctantly ascribed them to my Third Period, because of the early form TAPANTINOΣ on the reverse of the unique Type 22 (Santangelo, Naples, collection) and because of the fresh condition of the obverse die. It is further certain that No. 56, which shares its reverse die with a new obverse die of later style on No. 57 [cf. XII], can hardly be given an earlier dating than the one proposed here. That this No. 56A is one of the very latest oekists struck at Tarentum is proved by the presence of a rather fine example in the Torre del Ovo find.</p>

                  <p>The sea is represented by a naturalistic fish, of the <hi rend="italic">labrax</hi> species, swimming over the curling crests of the waves. This convention for depicting the sea waves makes its first appearance on the contemporary horsemen in Evans' Second Period Type A, Plate II, 5, Type DI, Plate II, 8 (now in my collection), Type D2 (cf. Strozzi Sale Cat., Pl. III, 849, now in the J. P. Morgan coll.) and on two other very rare types, both represented in my collection and not described in the "Horsemen," on which the whole design is enclosed in a circle of waves, the first being an unpublished and presumably unique new obverse with reverse as Type A, Per. II, the second an earlier modification of Type K. Per. II (cf. Maddalena Sale Cat., Pl. II, 9-now in my cabinet—and Dressel, Berlin Cat. No. 96) inscribed TAPA|<graphic url="NNM15_sym14.jpg"/>TI|<hi rend="italic">N</hi>Ω<hi rend="italic">N.</hi> Unfortunately we have no oekist specimen of either Nos. 57 or 58, which share the same obverse die, in really fine condition, to give a complete representation of this new pictorial version of Phalanthos on his dolphin. The Berlin example, Type 57<hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                     <pb n="198"/>
is the only one tolerably well centred. On the badly centred but otherwise fine coin in my cabinet there are apparently two minute letters On, in the field to the left, above the dolphin's tail. They are also visible on the Berlin example, but they may be no more than traces of small breaks of the die (cf. PI. XII, 57 <hi rend="italic">c</hi>). Should, however, the letters ΟΠ really exist, they are either the <hi rend="italic">marque d'atelier</hi> of Poseidon or the initials of the actual die-cutter who may well have also engraved the obverse die of No. 45 (Pl. X) which is of a strikingly similar style.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Type No. 58.</hi> The five known examples of this very rare new version, in spite of their rather worn condition, rank among the most beautiful representations of the seated œkist. Taras, strigil in hand, is represented seated on some low structure of masonry, possibly the walled enclosure of the palestra, as if keenly watching an athletic contest. The flowing hair of the hero points to a more recent Pheidian tendency which we find paralleled in certain figures of the Parthenon frieze. <ref target="#CH1-n158">158</ref>

                  <p>It is impossible to assign a precise date to the cessation of the oekist issues, or to decide whether the final adoption of the

equestrian types must be regarded as the outcome of a new aristocratic reaction placing the chief authority in the hands of an annual strategos, as <name type="pname">Garrucci</name> believes, or merely as a testimony of the pride taken by the Tarentines in the training that made their cavalry so famous in the field. There is no doubt that this important revolution took place sometime between c. 420 and 380 B. C., the time limits assigned by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> to his horsemen of his Second Period. A close study of all the earliest equestrian types has convinced me that their classification must be re-examined and somewhat altered if we take into consideration the type figuring on the obverse die. Throughout the earliest Tarentine coinage, down to the end of the fifth century, with only three exceptions [the ékists of Nos. 1, 25 and 33], Phalanthos astride the dolphin, is always placed on the obverse die. Likewise on all the earliest horsemen, the city's arms invariably figures on the obverse die. After c. 420 the παράσημου is transferred to the reverse. Taking this important consideration into account we
<pb n="201"/>
shall note that the style characteristics, the form of the inscriptions and the equestrian types of all the early transitional style, with the horsemen on the reverse die, fully corroborate the anteriority of their issue. Therefore the following five horsemen of Evans' Period II with the παράσημου still in its usual position, must be assigned to Period I, c. 450-430 B. C.</p>
                  <p>1. Evans Type A1 (Per. II, Pl. II, 5) inscribed <graphic url="NNM15_sym2.jpg"/>AT. This martial type must have been struck during the war between <name type="place">Taranto</name> and Thurium and may have been issued some time before 432 B. C.</p>
                  <p>2. I have already noted that Type B [Evans, Per. II., Pl.4, cf. <ref target="#fig-5">Fig. No. 3</ref>, p. 112,] belongs to one of the early issues of Period I.</p>
                  <p>3. Evans Type F1 (Per. II) is the description of only a poor representation given by Carelli T. CIX, 102, of Type C1 belonging to Evans' Per.

                  <p>4.Type EI (Evans, Per. II, Pl. II, 9) is
<pb n="202"/>
struck from the same obverse die as Type CI, of Period I, and must have been, judging from its very early style, certainly struck before 420 B. C.</p>
                  <p>5. Type G [Evans, Per. II—cf. Strozzi Sale Cat., Pl. III, 847, now in my collection] shares the same obverse die with three other very early horsemen of Period I, similar to Type A2 of Evans, Per. I [cf. Pl. II, 3l.</p>
                  <p>The horsemen type is transferred to the obverse die for the first time on Type CI of Period II [Evans, Pl. II, 6], and the reverse of this type, exhibiting Phalanthos on his dolphin holding on his left arm a lance and large oval shield, while extending in his right a crested helmet, shows close affinity to the oekists of Nos. 49 to 53D, which are among the latest issued. I have in my cabinet three horsemen of a rather common variety of Type C, Evans, Period II, not described by <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name>. This type is represented in the Hunter collection [Macdonald, 1. c., p. 70, No. 40], one of them bearing the παράσημου on the obverse die, and the two others with
<pb n="203"/>
this type transferred to the reverse die.<ref target="#CH1-n161">161</ref> Owing to the similarity of the dolphin rider of this type with the reverse of Evans, Type HI (Per. II), these interesting horsemen may be dated c. 400 B. C.; and this gives us the extreme limit of the oekist issues, my conclusion being that the last Tarentine nomos exhibiting the seated oekist was struck about when the horseman type was transferred to the obverse die position, where it was maintained thenceforward on the Tarentine nomoi for fully two hundred years.</p>

I have lately had the good fortune of securing, for my cabinet, a beautiful example (wt. 8.00) of this all but unique incuse nomos with inscription retrograde on both sides. The obverse is from the same die as the Athenian coin (cf. A. Postolaka,

This remarkable nomos comes from a small <name type="place">Southern Italy</name> find made years ago which included only four other incuse staters, all in fine condition, two of Croton [one as <name type="pname">Pozzi</name> Sale Cat., Pl.

Macdonald, coll. Hunter, Pl. IV, 21] represent the dolphin-rider, as on the incuse nomoi, in a stiff archaic pose resting his right hand on the dolphin's back and extending his left. The evidence of the Sava Find, 1856, in which the "wheel" nomoi were numerous and somewhat worn allows us to date the earlier types of this class as far back as 520 B. C.; cf. L. Sambon, <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les Monnaies de la Presqu'éle Italique,</hi>

                  <p>All the above is confirmed by the, 1833, Calabrian find (cf. Avellino, 1833) and the Sava deposit referred to above. Both finds contained numerous worn nomoi with the wheel, a certain number of nomoi with the hippocamp reverse, in very fresh condition, and a few also brilliant examples with the archaic head reverse. In the Péstum Find, 1858, which, according to <name type="pname">Sir Arthur Evan</name> [cf. 1. c., p. 40], was buried as late as c. 392 B. C., there occurred a few not well preserved nomoi, with the hippocamp and seated oekist reverses side by side with fine and very fine equestrian types of Periods I and II [B. C. 450-380].</p>
