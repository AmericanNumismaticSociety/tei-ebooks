            <p>Contemporary history is always written by the victors, by the conquerors. When posterity treads the laborious path to truth in an attempt to find out <hi rend="italic">wie es eigentlich gewesen</hi> â to quote the famous words of Ranke â great difficulties lie ahead. The written account, biased already when conceived, leads us astray. The chronicles with their unimaginative lists of sundry events and officials, compiled by industrious clerks and civil servants, had a long way to go before they reached the present day editions. The record which confronts us is the product of many rounds of mechanical copying in the monasteries, where the eye of a monk all too easily missed a line and thus created a chronological confusion.</p>
            <p>In discussing the reign of Constantine the Great, one of the great watersheds of history, out of which was to emerge Western Christian
<pb n="2"/>
Civilization, we are faced with these very difficulties. Yet there is one source, continuous and inexhaustible when treated properly, which can corroborate or refute the eulogies of the panegyrists, namely, the coinage.</p>
            <p>Constantine's road to sole-rulership covered a period of eighteen years, from the summer day in 306 when his father's faithful soldiers acclaimed him Augustus in York, to the September day in 324 when he finally, at Chrysopolis, defeated his last opponent, <persName>Licinius</persName>, his fellow-ruler and rival during thirteen of these years. The triumph of Constantine indubitably was the triumph of the Christian faith, but the question whether the Church would have been persecuted and paganism championed by a victorious <persName>Licinius</persName> can never be truthfully answered. The school of the Belgian Henri GrÃ©goire, ingeniously claiming <persName>Licinius</persName> as the true defender of Christianity,<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> and disputing the authenticity of Eusebius' <hi rend="italic">Vita Constantini</hi>, one of the main sources for the history of the Constantinian epoch, has by now suffered defeat.<ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Nevertheless, it would be wrong to accept at their face value all the accusations directed against <persName>Licinius</persName> by the supporters of Constantine. During the last three years of Licinian rule the rupture between East and West was apparent. This period in the East has been named the "last persecution,"<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> though on feeble grounds. Admittedly, the freedom of the Church was curtailed, Christian courtiers, civil servants and officers dismissed, and, possibly owing to over-zealous provincial governors, some adherents of the Church killed. But this does not warrant calling <persName>Licinius</persName> a persecutor.<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> The religious policy of the years immediately preceding the final clash was an intrinsic part of the general policy of the Emperors; <persName>Licinius</persName>, indifferent in religious matters, might well have appeared as a sponsor and supporter of Christendom had the wheel of fortune turned the other way.</p>

               <p>The main results of these studies were presented in two lectures at the 1960 Summer Seminar of the American Numismatic Society of <placeName>New York</placeName>. I am greatly indebted to the Society, and particularly to its former president, <persName>Mr. Louis</persName> C. West and to its Executive Director, <persName>Mr. Sawyer</persName> McA. Mosser, not only for encouraging the preparation of these studies for publication, but also for the stimulating experience I gained at the Seminar. Prof. <persName>A. R. Bellinger</persName>, Chairman of the ANS Publications' Committee, has read through the typescript more than once with keeneyed criticism. I am much obliged to him for numerous suggestions arising out of his familiarity with the subject matter and his demands for lucidity in presentation. <persName>Mr. George</persName> Kustas of Buffalo University, kindly read the manuscript and corrected its English. For this I want to express my sincere gratitude. However, it goes without saying that the author is solely responsible for the views expressed and the errors remaining in this volume. My thanks are also due to the staff of the ANS for friendly co-operation during the process of finishing the typescript and producing the plates. <persName>Mr. R. A. G. Carson</persName> of the British Museum has not only encouraged my research work but also assisted in providing casts for the illustrations.</p>
               <p>In the text below references to the actual coins have been made through reference to the numbers of the items listed in the Index of Reverse Legends (comprising the gold coins only). Illustrations have been indicated by inserting the number of the plate together with the number of the rev. leg., e.g. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 100. To avoid confusion the bronze coins illustrated have been accorded letters instead of numbers. The corresponding reference will accordingly be e.g. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, a. All the bronze coins illustrated are from the ANS collection except the Domitius <persName>Alexander</persName> coin (Ratto, December 1932, 722).</p>

               <hi rend="bold">II. THE BATTLE OF THE MILVIAN BRIDGE</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Three battles mark Constantine's progress to supreme power; the Milvian Bridge, Cibalae and Chrysopolis. The first gave him <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, the second the Balkans, the third the entire East. Now, let us follow him from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> to Antioch, from a barely accepted Caesarship within the framework of the tetrachic system to acknowledged sovereignty, surrounded by oriental splendor, in the whole Roman empire.</p>
            <p>In view of later events we may assume that Constantine from the beginning aspired after something more than a subordinate rank in the Western provinces. The precarious position of Constantine and Maxentius drew the rulers of Gaul and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> together, and the alliance was confirmed through the agency of the old Herculius when Constantine in 307 was married to Fausta and encouraged to assume the title of Augustus. A year later Maximian, ambitious of power but failing to discharge Maxentius, was expelled from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and forced to seek refuge with Constantine.<ref target="#CH2-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> The relations between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> were broken, but about the same time Maxentius' attention was distracted from the Gallic scene by the usurpation of Domitius <persName>Alexander</persName> in Africa.</p>
            <p>The two following years may be described as a time of gathering storms. The quiet was broken when, as the story goes, the old conspirator Maximian was found responsible for an attempt on
<pb n="4"/>
Constantine's life. In 310 he was killed, or killed himself, in besieged Massilia.<ref target="#CH2-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>This event was probably the signal for a major change in the political constellations. The filial devotion of Maxentius flared up once more and, according to literary sources, he was resolved to avenge his father's death.<ref target="#CH2-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> The African usurper, however, prevented him from taking instant action. In these circumstances Constantine and Domitius <persName>Alexander</persName> naturally formed an alliance, the evidence of which can be found on the African milestone mentioning these two Augusti only.<ref target="#CH2-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> At the same time, possibly a little later, Constantine appears to have broken the isolation of Gaul in Europe; both <persName>Licinius</persName> and Daza are depicted on the coin obverses of this time.<ref target="#CH2-n10">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> The consent of <persName>Licinius</persName> was of paramount importance to Constantine when engaged in a war for supremacy in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>. A ruler <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> since 307, <hi rend="italic">de iure</hi> since 308, and specifically charged with the reconquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy,5</placeName>
               <persName>Licinius</persName> might in ordinary circumstances have been reluctant to accept Constantine's interference south of the Alps, but in 310 Galerius was taken seriously ill<ref target="#CH2-n12">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> and the stakes in the prosperous East were higher than those in the West. Both <persName>Licinius</persName> and Daza concentrated on the future division of the Eastern provinces, and the West was left to settle its disputes on its own. The fact that after the death of Galerius Daza captured Asia, reached the Bosporus and was halted only by the arrival of his rival<ref target="#CH2-n13">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> demonstrates how far-sighted <persName>Licinius</persName> had been.</p>
            <p>Thus the stage was set. Maxentius made the first move and in early 311 dispatched Rufius Volusianus to cope with the rebellion

in Africa.<ref target="#CH2-n14">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> At the same time that tension grew in the East, Galerius' condition was rapidly deteriorating. In the spring of 311 Constantine celebrated his second <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> and struck, among other reverses, the exceptional type SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI in gold at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 201â2).</p>
            <p>The date of this gold type can be established with a high degree of certainty. The early Treveran gold portraits of Constantine are very distinct in character; after the very first coins naming Constantine Caesar,<ref target="#CH2-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> we get a series of solidi of small module, thick flan, and high relief. The minting of this kind of solidus comes to an end when, shortly after the decisive victory at Pons Milvius, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> discontinues its gold series and Constantinian gold minting is concentrated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, first at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and Ostia, later at Ticinum. Gold coining was resumed at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> only towards the end of 313, possibly not before 314, and then with coins of distinctly thinner flans and larger module.<ref target="#CH2-n16">

            <p>Now the second group of Constantinian obverses can be classified chronologically, and the systematic arrangement shows the coins with the obverse legend CONSTAN-TINVS PF AVG (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 201) to be of earlier date, the coins with the obverse legend CONSTANTI- NVS PF AVG (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate I</hi>, 202) to be later. By a stroke of luck the chronological dividing line between these two kinds of obverse breaks can be dated to Constantine's quinquennial year, because a part of the obverses of the type VOTIS V MVLTIS X/VICTORIA AVG has the break N-T (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 312), another part the break I-N (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 313). The coins of the type SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI can be grouped in the same way.<ref target="#CH2-n17">

            <p>Thus it remains to establish when the Constantinian <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> were celebrated. The point of departure for the reckoning of regnal years was the <hi rend="italic">natalis imperii</hi> of the ruler, regardless of the title conferred upon him on his ascent to the throne. With regard to Constantine the situation is unusually complicated. His original <hi rend="italic">dies imperii</hi>, regularly celebrated in later years, was July 25th. The realization of the weakness of his position â the very fact which led him to accept the early alliance with Maximian and Maxentius â made him to a certain extent dependent on his allies. Thus he appears to have accepted the title of Augustus from Maximian on the occasion of his marriage to Fausta, although he seems to have delayed using it for some time.<ref target="#CH2-n18">

               </ref> until the conquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>; when the Roman senate conferred upon him the title of <hi rend="italic">Maximus Augustus</hi>, he can be supposed to have resumed his original <hi rend="italic">natalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dies imperii</hi>. His <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi>, however, would have been celebrated according to the earlier reckoning, on March 31, 311 and 312.</p>
            <p>We return now to the legend SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI. The reading was no novelty, but it had scarcely been in use since the days of Trajan.<ref target="#CH2-n20">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> A slogan revived after 200 years is not commonplace, but in this context two additional facts enable us to appreciate the true significance of this issue. The first is that the same type was struck by the usurper Domitius <persName>Alexander</persName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, a) in Africa.<ref target="#CH2-n21">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> This can be no mere coincidence. Clearly we have here another piece of evidence of the alliance between Gaul and Africa. But let us take the other fact, the fact that the type SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI was struck in two mints <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> and Carthage, out of reach of the Senate. The
<pb n="7"/>
implication of the type is that the Senate pays homage to an Emperor (Constantine or <persName>Alexander</persName>) on the verge of war or actually engaged in a war with the master of the Senate (Maxentius) ! Therefore, there is but one way of interpreting the evidence of the coins, namely that Constantine and, accordingly, his African ally, had reached an understanding with the Senate or with an opposition faction of the Senate. In itself this is not surprising, for we have ample proof of senatorial discontent with the tyrant of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n22">

            <p>Thus the Treveran gold coins of the type SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI have given us the ramifications of the Italian campaign of Constantine and, indeed, the date: the spring 311 instead of the generally accepted year 312.

By that time the first Constantinian gold coins had been issued at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.

               <p>The chronology of these events is not undisputed.

Forsch. in NiederÃ¶sterreich</hi> III, 1956, pp. 178ff.) which breaks away from the traditional adherence to Lactantius' account, more closely follows Zosimus, and enables us to restrict the number of Maximian's visits to Gaul to two. According to Seston the conference at Camuntum, a much less elaborate meeting with Diocletian than has usually been believed, took place in 307, when <persName>Licinius</persName> was charged with the reconquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, whereas the rank of Augustus was conferred upon him only a year later. Cf. also <persName>Dr. Kent's</persName> arguments in <hi rend="italic">NC</hi> 1957, PP. 21 ff. Andreotti, op. cit., p. 982, does not entirely accept Seston's theory, but concedes that preliminary discussions might have taken place before November 308, though not earlier than the Spring 308.</p>

               <p>The series of analyses of the metallic contents of these so called billon coins, not yet completed at the moment of writing, suggests the possibility that the whole series was a normal bronze series. The <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori aug</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Victoriae laetae princ perp</hi> would have been struck after Civil War I, whereas the Daza coins of the rev. <hi rend="italic">Soli invicto comiti</hi> should be regarded as Â½-folles struck before Mid-313. It should be noted that the two former types were struck in two <hi rend="italic">officinae</hi>, the latter in one off. only, and that the <graphic url="NNM146_023.jpg"/> series was the first to be struck in two off. And then, until well after Civil War I, the off. were marked A and B, whereas the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori aug</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Victoriae laetae princ perp</hi> both have the off. mark P and S. If this suggestion is correct, the gold rev. <hi rend="italic">Victoriae laetae princ perp</hi> would have been a creation of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and this would, in fact, strengthen my contention that the coins had been struck in the course of the decennial year. I propose to return to this question in the forthcoming volume of Roman Imperial Coinage (vol. VII). Cf. also note 1, p. 49 below.</p>

                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>

               <p>After studying the Arelate coinage I had an opportunity of working through the coinages of all other mints. Therefore, I propose to demonstrate how the coins in no single mint speak against the redating of the Bellum Cibalense, and in several instances permit no other conclusion.</p>
               <p>Let us start with Arelate. We know that the mint was created as a substitute for Ostia, and that the personnel of the Ostian mint was moved to Southern Gaul,<ref target="#CH3-n39">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> with the possible exception of some skilled die-cutters sent to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum.5</placeName> The time can be established roughly as shortly after the break of relations between Constantine and <persName>Licinius</persName> on the one hand and Daza on the other, i.e., any time after the conference at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mediolanum">Milan</placeName> in early 313. The exact time when the mint of Ostia
<pb n="11"/>
was closed cannot be ascertained, but Daza is adequately represented on all Ostian issues.<ref target="#CH3-n41">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> Now my <placeName>British</placeName> colleagues have argued that Arelate must have started working in mid-314, immediately before the Civil War I, traditionally fixed to the same year.<ref target="#CH3-n42">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> Thus the war would not have made any impact on the coinage of this mint. Their main argument appears to be that about a year was required for the transfer of the mint of Carthage to Ostia and that an opening date of 313 at Arelate "presupposes an operational celerity not evinced in the earlier move."<ref target="#CH3-n43">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> It is, however, quite clear that Messrs. Carson and Kent have exaggerated the duration of the transfer of the African mint to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>. Miss Cathy <persName>E. King</persName> has pointed out in her closely argued study of the Maxentian mints that the closure of Carthage must have been later than the British team supposed,<ref target="#CH3-n44">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> and that the reopening of the mint in Ostia took place almost six months earlier than they had thought.<ref target="#CH3-n45">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> Applied to Arelate this means that minting must have started well before the New Year's Day in 314; not even a start in the summer 313 should be considered impossible.<ref target="#CH3-n46">

               <p>This, of course, is conjecture based on an estimate of the duration of the transfer of the Ostian mint. The coins themselves are much

more outspoken, regardless of the fact that of the early series comprising mainly the reverse types MARTI CONSERVATORI and SOLI INVICTO COMITI, the date of two coins only can be definitely as sessed as 315, namely, two consular coins marked PARL and <graphic url="NNM146_026A.jpg"/>

                  </ref> the very series illustrating the conflict with <persName>Licinius</persName> as <persName>Licinius</persName> disappears from the obverses in the course of the first series and is absent from the two following. This conflict immediately preceded the nomination of the Caesars (officially confirmed at the settlement at Serdica on March 1, 317). The absence of <persName>Licinius</persName> from certain series cannot be due to pure chance, as the coins preserved to our days are fairly numerous. Of the <graphic url="NNM146_026E.jpg"/> mark a single <persName>Licinius</persName> obverse is known against 27 Constantinian; for the subsequent <graphic url="NNM146_026F.jpg"/> my material contains 6, for the <graphic url="NNM146_026G.jpg"/> mark 31 obverses of Constantine. The ratio of Constantinian to Licinian obverses for the other pre-317 marks is PARL 78/31 (15/7 63/24) <graphic url="NNM146_026A.jpg"/> 50/22 <graphic url="NNM146_026H.jpg"/> 19/3 <graphic url="NNM146_026I.jpg"/> 55/31</p>
               <p>Except for the <graphic url="NNM146_026J.jpg"/> issue we have a substantial representation of Licinian obverses. Assuming for the sake of argument that Arelate started coining in mid-314, and that Civil War I was fought in 314,
<pb n="13"/>
as the British scholars contend, we are faced with the inexplicable fact that Constantine throughout the war and the preliminaries to the war faithfully remembered his adversary on the coins, but a couple of years later, when peace ruled the Empire, ignored his fellow-ruler. The short series of PARL coins (with large flans and with the long obverse legend IMP C CONSTANTINVS PF AVG) undoubtedly struck before the consular coins of 315 marked PARL,<ref target="#CH3-n50">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> actually have a higher ratio of Licinian obverses than the second part of this issue with short obverse legends (15/7 and 63/24, respectively).</p>
               <p>It is time to leave Arelate and continue to the other Western mints. Londinium, strangely enough, remained completely unaffected by the events, and regularly coined Licinian obverses up to the settlement at Serdica; but almost as an afterthought the Licinii do not appear on the coins after the war at all, obviously an indication of the isolated position of the British Isles.<ref target="#CH3-n51">

They refer to a letter by St. Augustine (Ep. 88,2, not 82,2 as given by Carson- Kent). St. Augustine, however, records a letter by the <hi rend="italic">proconsul Africae</hi> Anicius Anulinus to Constantine, dated April 15, 313, in Carthage (as to the genuineness of the letter, cf. H. Kraft, <hi rend="italic">Kaiser Konstantins religiose Entwicklung</hi>, pp. 32ff., particularly p. 33, note 2). But the letter is not valid evidence in this context; it only shows that the news of the impending war had not reached Carthage by Mid-April. If this were the only evidence and the argument otherwise sound, Ostia might have ceased coining in March, if not earlier. It seems that the controversy regarding the time of the transfer of the Ostian mint to Arelate is a point of academic interest only. The fact that Daza appears to be present in all issues proves that coining easily could have been discontinued before Daza's disappearance from the obv., but not later than the last date when Daza can be attested as Augustus, acknowledged in the West (April 15, 313 in the inscription <hi rend="italic">CIL</hi> VI, 507 preserved by Cyriacus Anconitanus Parm., and recording the third consulships of Constantine and Daza).</p>

               <p>Civil War I gave Constantine almost all the Licinian territory in Europe, and two new mint cities, Siscia and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>.

The puzzling feature of the sequence is the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> with the Constantinian obverses dominant. <persName>Dr. Kent</persName> dates this type to 317 and presumes a discontinuance of coining between 314 and 317.<ref target="#CH3-n65">

               <p>Should hypothesis (ii) be accepted, we can find no reason for <persName>Licinius</persName> to discontinue coining after the war in one of his chief mints. The fact that it started working as soon as it fell into the hands of Constantine, proves that the staff had not been evacuated. Two years of inactivity at one of the major mints appears impractical and inexplicable. The probability that <persName>Licinius</persName> should have struck the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> dominated by Constantine at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> during these years is negligible.</p>
               <p>Turning from numismatic surmise to political reality, hypothesis (ii) can be dismissed as impossible. If military operations had ceased in 314 or early 315 and the peace treaty was signed two years afterwards, Constantine must have withdrawn his troops from Licinian territory during the negotiations for peace. It should be remembered that during the campaign he advanced very far into Licinian territory, actually to Philippopolis, thus cutting off his adversary, who had retreated to the northwest in the direction of Beroea,<ref target="#CH3-n68">

               <p>The disposition of the opposing armies in the theatre of war should be kept in mind when discussing the two remaining possibilities (iii) and (iv), both of which imply that the war was fought in 316. In either case <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> would have been isolated from the Licinian main army during the war, while the Constantinian fleet threatened the communications with its sovereign.<ref target="#CH3-n69">

                  </ref> In actual fact the problem whether (iii) or (iv) is the correct solution boils down to the question whether Constantine, having gained possession of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, continued striking the Licinian <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> as the Augustan counterpart to the types of the Caesars (PRINCIPIA IVVENTVTIS, CLARITAS REIPVBLICAE, VIRTVS MILITVM DD NN).</p>
               <p>A close examination of the bronze coins shows that the patron of Christianity, who many years earlier broke away from the tetrarchic

system, after the war hailed Jupiter his tutelary god. For Constantine two different obverse legends were used in the course of the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> issue, namely <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf inv aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, s) and <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, u). Of these obverse legends the former is the earlier; in prewar times Constantine had been depicted as a bearded middle-aged man (the portrait employed was probably a Licinian one), in the earlier part of the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> issue we find a broad tetrarchic portrait of a youthful man without beard; in one instance a Licinian portrait with beard is connected with the obverse legend <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf inv aug</hi>. This portrait is subsequently superseded by a new, narrow Constantinian portrait, the same portrait we encounter on the first Constantinian gold coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 235), and except for a few instances of the <hi rend="italic">inv (ictus</hi>) obverse legend (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, s), all these portraits are coupled with the short obverse legend <hi rend="italic">pf aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, u).</p>
               <p>The pattern is now clear. At <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> a new portrait of Constantine was created in the traditional style, and issued together with obverses of <persName>Licinius</persName>. The obverse legend for this part of the issue was <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf inv aug</hi>. Before the obverse legend was curtailed once more a new Constantinian portrait was created, this time an entirely different one, breaking away from the tetrarchic tradition. It is a fair inference that this happened when Constantine took possession of the city after the settlement at Serdica. At the same time the Licinian obverses disappeared. Expressed in terms of political history this shows that Constantine did not capture <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> during the war, but that the mint city itself during the war tried a policy of appeasing both Constantine (named <hi rend="italic">invictus</hi>) and its legitimate sovereign <persName>Licinius</persName>, a very natural reaction for a city in such an awkwardly isolated position as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica's</placeName>. After the war the city fell into the hands of Constantine, the tetrarchie portrait was superseded by a new one, gold coining started and <persName>Licinius</persName> disappeared from the bronze coinage. Thus hypothesis (iv) proves to be the correct solution of our problem.<ref target="#CH3-n70">

                  <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> as struck by Constantine after the war, there is always the possibility that the Jupiter type was continued as an emergency, very much in the same way as anachronistic gold types were issued. But would any mint official have taken the responsibility for this if Constantine really was considered Christian or an ardent champion of the Christian faith? We should also note that Constantine was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> very shortly after the settlement at Serdica, and that the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> must have continued to be struck for some time. The material is abundant and the obv. of curtailed obv. legg. (<hi rend="italic">pf aug</hi>) appear to be twice as common as the <hi rend="italic">pf inv. aug</hi> legends. If we assume that the <hi rend="italic">pf inv aug</hi> were contemporaneous with the Licinian obv., all of them struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> during the war, i.e. during at least 2â3 months, the numerical strength of my material (35 coins of each against about 70 of the obv. leg. <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf aug)</hi>, suggest that the <hi rend="italic">Iovi Conservatori</hi>, almost literally struck under the very eyes of Constantine, cannot have lasted a shorter time than the previous series. On the other hand we should note that the presence of the Emperor and the court in the mint city naturally increased the local need of cash, and therefore the intensity of striking. Again, the theory that the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> was allowed to continue as an emergency finds little support in the fact that at the same time new types were introduced both for gold and for bronze coining. It is therefore very unlikely that Jupiter appeared on the bronze coins against the intentions of the Emperor.</p>

                  <persName>Dr. Kent</persName>, dating the Civil War as 314, and realizing the difficulties involved if these coins be accepted as genuine, prefers to disregard them entirely.<ref target="#CH3-n73">

               <hi rend="bold">IV. THE THEORY OF THE TRAVELLING MINT</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The brilliant Austrian numismatist Georg Elmer once made the provocative suggestion that the late Roman gold mint was a travelling mint.<ref target="#CH4-n81">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Unfortunately the paper in which he developed this idea was never published in full; it has therefore been impossible to test his arguments in detail. Nevertheless <persName>Dr. Kent</persName> of the British Museum later followed the same line of thought in his study of the late fourth century gold coinage<ref target="#CH4-n82">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> and in a survey of the tetrarchic gold coinage Professor Pink hinted at a similar phenomenon by noticing how the center of gravity with regard to the coining changed according to the political activity of the Emperor.<ref target="#CH4-n83">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>I now propose to demonstrate that the travelling mint was a reality, and venture to illustrate how the organization worked in Constantinian times. I do not pretend to be able to give more than an outline, and I am fully aware of the fact that future research might occasion revisions in details.</p>
            <p>The notion of a travelling mint is closely connected with the fact that the Emperor, particularly before the foundation of Constantinople, had a moving headquarters and no fixed capital as an ad-
<pb n="24"/>
ministrative center. Thus it becomes of primary importance to establish his itinerary; again this has previously largely been done on the basis of his legislation, his edicts, rescripts and so on, grouped around certain events, unanimously fixed geographically and physically by our literary sources. Yet the milestones available are few, and the itineraries have remained largely conjectural. It is my conviction that a close analysis of the gold coinage enables us to construct and reconstruct the Imperial chronology with an accuracy almost equal to that derived from a study of the legislation. The final result will, of course, emerge out of an effort to reconsider the <hi rend="italic">"Regesten</hi>" in the light of numismatic research. In this context, however, I have thought it wisest to touch upon these legal matters only when they directly have affected the arrangement of the gold issues; a systematic revision of the dates of the Theodosian Code, the most important source for a study of Constantinian legislation, would certainly be outside the compass of this paper.</p>
            <p>Before attempting a discussion of details, a few words should be said with regard to the gold coinage as a whole. A striking characteristic is the wide range of types employed, particularly in the earlier part of the reign of Constantine â contrary to the practice adopted for the bronze coinage. Whereas the bronze coinage, at least in geographically restricted areas, generally speaking, was uniform, the gold coinage clearly was highly differentiated. Certain mints never coined any gold at all (Londinium, Lugdunum), others short series only (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, Arelate, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, Heraclea). Only rarely can we find exactly parallel sets of gold types in any two mints. We may find <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> exclusively striking the <hi rend="italic">vota suscepta</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> (263, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 264, 266, 267) of the Caesars, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> as the only mint commemorating the fifth consulship of Constantine, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> striking <hi rend="italic">votis x</hi> (i.e. <hi rend="italic">soluta) caess nn</hi> (315) but <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> coining <hi rend="italic">votis x caes n</hi> (314) of exactly the same reverse type. This, I believe, is an indication that many of the gold issues are not contemporaneous but successive.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it should be stressed that in most cases the individual mints, also when striking gold, retain their particular style of portraiture, an indication that the mints remained stationary whereas the organizers or controllers were mobile.</p>
            <pb n="25"/>
            <p>In order to establish the chronological sequence of the gold issues we should begin by studying the travels of the Emperor and as far as possible ascertain his whereabouts throughout his reign. On the whole, I propose to do this without the aid of the numismatic material. Once Constantine's itinerary is worked out, the next step will be to discover how far the gold minting coincides with the temporary residences of the Emperor. Once the general principle is placed beyond dispute, we may be entitled to infer that certain locally limited gold series presuppose a visit of the court to the mint city in question. My aim is to reconstruct the itinerary and to demonstrate how the literary sources, mainly the Imperial constitutions, and the numismatic material can be correlated.</p>

The expression "the travelling mint," though not strictly accurate, will be used in the sequel as a matter of convenience. In actual fact it seems impossible to ascertain at present to what extent the minting was mobile and to what extent the mobility of the mints coincided with the travels of the Emperor. Though the general rule probably was that the mints (the bronze minting) were stationary and that the Emperor (or court) when travelling employed the services of these mints, there are certain signs suggesting a great deal of mobility among the mint employees, signs not entirely compatible with <persName>Dr. Kent's</persName> theory of the fourth century bronze as struck not continuously "but in spasmodic outbursts of intense activity" (Pattern, p. 31).</p>

               <hi rend="bold">V. THE DATES OF THE THEODOSIAN CODE</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The basic source of our knowledge of the travels of the Emperor is the Theodosian Code.<ref target="#CH5-n84">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> A great number of Imperial constitutions record both date (<hi rend="italic">datum)</hi> and place of issue. The year is indicated by the consular year. In many instances either the date or the place is fragmentary or missing.</p>
            <p>Occasionally the subscriptions of the constitutions state also, or exclusively, the date and/or the place where they were received (<hi rend="italic">acceptum)</hi> and properly exhibited or proposed (<hi rend="italic">propositum</hi>). If nothing but the <hi rend="italic">acceptum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi> has been preserved, we get a <hi rend="italic">terminus ante</hi> for the constitutions as such but, of course, no indication of the date and place of issue. If, however, we know from other sources (possibly other constitutions) the Emperor's temporary residence, it is permissible to calculate the approximate time between the <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">acceptum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi>. If the place of the <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> coincides with the place of the <hi rend="italic">acceptum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi>, a very short time is likely to have elapsed between the one and the other.<ref target="#CH5-n85">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Owing to the varying and uncertain sources of the Theodosian Code, the preserved dates are to a high degree conflicting. This is eloquently illustrated by <persName>Mommsen's</persName> endeavour to work out the itinerary of the Emperors in his introduction of his edition of the Code.<ref target="#CH5-n86">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> The great German scholar was compelled to confine himself to general conclusions such as (for the year 319 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi>) "<hi rend="italic">De hoc quoque anno historia nobis utilia non suppeditat</hi>. Constitutions<hi rend="italic">, quae quidem locum habeant, ducunt ad Illyricum potissimum. Neque Roman neque Galliam hoc anno Constantinus adiit</hi>."<ref target="#CH5-n87">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The only way of escaping contradictory statements about dates and places is an examination of the principles underlying the com-
<pb n="27"/>
position of the Code. <persName>Mommsen</persName>, of course, laid a firm foundation for future research, and Otto Seeck, using his intimate knowledge of the Late Roman Empire and the legislative procedure finally succeeded in working out a logical and consistent arrangement.<ref target="#CH5-n88">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Any such arrangement necessarily involves a great deal of emendation and interpolation. The ruling principle is to make certain dates, established independently of the constitutions, points of departure, and then consider the constitutions which by their dates and/or places of issue clearly conflict with other evidence. Thus we are compelled to evaluate the possible sources of errors occurring in the Code. Seeck devotes some 150 pages to an excellent analysis of all the problems arising in this context.</p>
            <p>It would certainly take us too far to recapitulate Seeck's arguments. Some points of importance for the subsequent discussion should, however, be mentioned.</p>
            <p>The fundamental reason for the inaccuracies with regard to the consular years is the Emperor Theodosius' instructions that in any case of conflicting constitutions the chronologically later should be valid.<ref target="#CH5-n89">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> All the material of the Code should therefore be arranged in chronological order within each book and title. In addition each constitution was to be dated in an easily recognisable way, according to the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi>.<ref target="#CH5-n90">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> Seeck shows conclusively that the subscriptions frequently are interpolations based on the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi>, and more regularly so for the earlier parts of the period covered by the Theodosian Code (311â438). The result is, to quote his words: <hi rend="italic">"Wir haben hierdurch den methodischen Grundsatz gewonnen, daÎ² Datierungen</hi>, die <hi rend="italic">den Fasten genau entsprechen</hi>, minder <hi rend="italic">vertrauenswÃ¼rdig sind als solche</hi>, die <hi rend="italic">von ihnen in der Form irgendwie abweichen."</hi>
               <ref target="#CH5-n91">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>For the Constantinian time the dates of the subscriptions therefore on the whole correspond to the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> except for <hi rend="italic">"kleine Text</hi>- fehler, <hi rend="italic">me die Weglassung oder Entstellung der Iterationsziffern, Verwechslungen Ã¤hnlich lautenden Namen, z. B. Constante und Constantio u. dgl</hi>. m."<ref target="#CH5-n92">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> Once occurs a nonexistent consulate, and the only
<pb n="28"/>
deviation from the wording of the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> is the use of the formula <hi rend="italic">ipso A VII et C conss</hi>, which occurs three times. This wording is very likely original.<ref target="#CH5-n93">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> The close correspondence to the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> is also shown by the complete absence of postconsulates (to be discussed later) for the years 312â336.<ref target="#CH5-n94">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>(1) The first point of importance is accordingly that the consular years of the Constantinian period frequently are interpolations, that the iterations easily may be faulty<ref target="#CH5-n95">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> and that a confusion between rulers with similar names (Constantine I and II, Constantius and Constans) can be expected to occur. The same, of course, applies to <persName>Licinius</persName> and his son.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking the consulships of private persons can be expected to be correct.<ref target="#CH5-n96">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Invaluable aid for chronological considerations is rendered by extant or reconstructed lists of officials, particularly by the list of urban prefects.<ref target="#CH5-n97">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> In fact, a study of Late Roman prosopography is intimately connected with any examination of the Theodosian Code. Seeck regarded his Regesten as a <hi rend="italic">"Vorarbeit zu einer Prosopo</hi>- graphie <hi rend="italic">der christlichen Kaiserzeit"</hi> and he consistently tried to reconstruct the lists of the holders of Imperial offices. When the consulships are in doubt, the addressees of the constitutions frequently give valuable clues as to the date.</p>
            <p>(2) The second point of importance is therefore that we have to examine dubious dates (as indicated by the consular years in the subscription) in the light of the prosopographical data available; these as well as the geographical dates given in the subscriptions are even more important as chronological criteria than the consulates of the Emperors. <hi rend="italic">"Im allgemeinen gilt fÃ¼r die Kaiserkonsulate der methodische Grundsatz, daÎ² sie sich bis auf die Zeit des Valens herab fast beliebig untereinander vertauschen lassen. Welches in jedem ein- zelnen Falle zu wÃ¤hlen ist, darÃ¼ber entscheiden weniger die Iterations</hi>-

               <hi rend="italic">zifjern oder die Kaisernamen, als Ort und Adressat, mitunter noch auch der Inhalt des Gesetzes"</hi>
               <ref target="#CH5-n98">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The postconsulate is another conception, which should be mentioned here. Dating by postconsulates was employed when the consuls were unknown or unacceptable.<ref target="#CH5-n99">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Seeck states two important facts with regard to the postconsulates, (a) that they do not occur exclusively in the beginning of a year (when conceivably the authorities concerned had not been notified of the consuls of the year), and (b) that the compilers did their utmost to eliminate the postconsulates from the consular reckoning in the Code.<ref target="#CH5-n100">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> Another source of error was, of course, the unconscious omission of a postconsulate.<ref target="#CH5-n101">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>(3) The third point is thus that a seemingly incorrect date may depend on an omitted or deleted postconsulate. In these cases the right date would be either a year earlier<ref target="#CH5-n102">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> or later<ref target="#CH5-n103">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> than suggested by the subscription. Again, if the subscription records Imperial consulates, we may have several starting points when counting backwards or forward.<ref target="#CH5-n104">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>We have noted above that the <hi rend="italic">accepta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proposita</hi> have little chronological significance with regard to our particular purpose. The computers of the Theodosian Code appear to have held the same view. When, however, constitutions recording solely the note of acceptance or proposal were included in the Code, this appears to
<pb n="30"/>
be due to lack of complete records of the Imperial legislation.<ref target="#CH5-n105">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Consequently texts with solely <hi rend="italic">accepta</hi> or <hi rend="italic">proposita</hi> were added as a kind of emergency. In an effort to reconstruct the original text an <hi rend="italic">acc</hi>. or <hi rend="italic">p(ro)p(ositum</hi>) frequently appears to have been substituted by a <hi rend="italic">dat</hi>.<ref target="#CH5-n106">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Otherwise the guiding principle seems to have been that preferably the <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> should be recorded rather than the <hi rend="italic">acceptum</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">propositum. Datum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi> in the same text are clearly due to negligence.<ref target="#CH5-n107">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>(4) The fourth point emerging out of Seeck's examination is accordingly that a <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> may be a substitution either for an <hi rend="italic">acceptum</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi>. This, however, applies only to constitutions where the place of the <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi> is located in the administrative area of the addressee except in the case of high court officials.<ref target="#CH5-n108">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> In certain cases this obviously enables us to date a constitution a year later than suggested by the text.<ref target="#CH5-n109">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Seeck regards the passages giving the time of the year (month and day) as more reliable than the consulates. Dubious points can usually be interpolated by ordinary philological methods. As the exact date of each constitution was required, we may expect to encounter some interpolations in this context, too.<ref target="#CH5-n110">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> The place of issue or of acceptance was, however, of secondary importance to the compilers. It is therefore little surprising that this part of the subscription in many cases has been omitted. On the other hand, we may assume the places recorded mainly to have been rendered correctly. Seeck regards them as by far the most trustworthy part of the subscription,<ref target="#CH5-n111">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> though mistakes do occur. Dubious points can usually be explained with recourse to philological analysis. Most cases suggest a confusion of common, frequently occurring names with little known localities of similarly sounding names.</p>
            <p>It remains to say a few words about the preambles of the constitutions, consisting of two parts, (a) the name of the legislator,

and (b) the addressee. The former must frequently have been supplied with the aid of the consular year noted in the subscription. The original wording may have been e.g. <hi rend="italic">idem A</hi> or <hi rend="italic">idem AA</hi>. This had to be altered in the text of the Code, and consequently this called for a conclusion of the computer.<ref target="#CH5-n112">

            <p>(5) As a fifth point we may note that, (a) the dates of the Calendar year, (b) the geographical names, and (c) the names of the addressees are by far the most reliable parts of the passages of the constitutions important for dating purposes.</p>
            <p>(6) The sixth point is that in dubious cases little heed should be paid to the titles of the addressees.</p>
            <p>In the sequel the dates of certain Constantinian constitutions will be discussed with the explicit aim of establishing the Emperor's itinerary. This implies that only dated constitutions with an indication of the place of issue will be considered. In so far as revisions of the dates of certain constitutions appear necessary, the picture of Constantine's legislation should be drawn anew. This task without direct bearing on the chronological problems must, however, be reserved for future research.</p>
            <p>The basis of the subsequent survey is the redating of Constantine's first Licinian war, proposed earlier by me,<ref target="#CH5-n116">

Seeck's <hi rend="italic">Regesten</hi> are more or less a series of interpolations based on a brilliant analysis of the principles governing the conception of the Theodosian Code. Once a part of the Emperor's itinerary is adjusted, a chain reaction is started. The purpose of the following pages is to see how this chain reaction started by the redating of Civil War I affects our conception of the Constantinian Chronology as a whole.</p>
            <p>The first brief part of our examination indicates, with reference to earlier studies that the travels by Seeck dated to 313 really belong to the year 314.</p>
            <p>As a point of departure for our study of the dates of the Theodosian constitutions, we may take the fact that Constantine left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mediolanum">Milan</placeName> after the conference with <persName>Licinius</persName> in the spring of 313 to fight the German tribes on the Rhine frontier.<ref target="#CH5-n119">

            </p>
            <p>Curiously enough we have no proofs that Constantine took up residence at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> until December 27, 313 (CTh XI 29, 1; 30, 1).<ref target="#CH5-n120">

               </ref> Nevertheless, despite the war operations on the frontier we may assume that Constantine made <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> his headquarters and center of the civil administration much earlier, and after the German wars we find him there late in December 313.

               </ref> obviously for the consular procession on the New Year.</p>
            <pb n="33"/>
            <p>The following section purports to show that Constantine stayed in Gaul, using <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> as his headquarters until and past his initial decennial celebrations. The first part of the inquiry concerns the constitutions accepted by Seeck as showing Constantine staying elsewhere during this period. This will take us through the controversial years 314â5 to the Civil War in 316, and actually to 318 as there seems to be little disagreement with regard to the Emperor's movements in 317.</p>
            <p>The rich and varied coinage of the year of Constantine's fourth consulship and of his decennial celebrations (315/316) suggests that Constantine remained in Gaul until the initial decennial celebrations, and a study of the Constantinian constitutions confirms our hypothesis. The presumed decennial celebrations at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> prove to be based on an erroneous conjecture. Modern research has without hesitation accepted <persName>Mommsen's</persName> views as expressed in <hi rend="italic">CIL</hi> I, p. 397 <hi rend="italic">"Testibus legum subscriptionibus circa illud tempus in urbe mora- batur</hi>." The Theodosian Code, however, gives little support to his theory. The incorrect date of the CTh VIII 7, 1 has been demonstrated in other context.<ref target="#CH5-n126">

                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> That Constantine should have stayed in Licinian territory in 315 is quite impossible.</p>
            <p>The next decree in Seeck's Regesten is more controversial, CTh VIII 18, 1 <hi rend="italic">"dat XV kal Aug Aquil, recitata aput Vettium Rufinum pu in senatu non Sept Constantino A V et Licinio C conss"</hi> Seeck<ref target="#CH5-n128">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> builds his chronological considerations on the fact that Vettius Rufinus was urban prefect in 315/316 and concludes that the dating must be wrong. The correct consular dating according to him was <hi rend="italic">Constantino A et Licinio conss</hi>, i.e., 312, 313 or 315. By choosing the latter year he is forced to alter the place of issue, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> to Aquaviva, some twenty miles outside <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, because according to <persName>Mommsen's</persName> interpretation of the Calendar of Philo-
<pb n="34"/>
calus, Constantine must have entered <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> either on July 18 or 21. The crucial point is the mention made of the urban prefect Vettius Rufinus. There were two contemporary Vettii Rufinii, the urban prefect of 315/316, C. Vettius Cossinius Rufinus,<ref target="#CH5-n129">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> and the Vettius Rufinus who was pretorian prefect in 319/320<ref target="#CH5-n130">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>and possibly consul in 323. The text is fairly corrupt. At least it varies in different manuscripts. The <hi rend="italic">apparatus criticus</hi> records <hi rend="italic">"apud uettium</hi> (uittium N, vectium OC, ricium G), <hi rend="italic">rufinum</hi> (om. O), <graphic url="NNM146_048A.jpg"/> (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi> PMLS, <graphic url="NNM146_048B.jpg"/> H, pfm E, <graphic url="NNM146_048C.jpg"/> N, pfp C, <graphic url="NNM146_048D.jpg"/> G, <graphic url="NNM146_048E.jpg"/> B, om. O)." It is therefore very likely that the <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> is corrupt, that the official in question was either the former urban prefect C. Vettius Cossinius Rufinus, in 319 holding some other office, or the pretorian prefect Vettius Rufinus, although the latter interpretation makes the words <hi rend="italic">in senatu</hi> more difficult to understand. That the decree thus was issued on July 18, 318 or 319 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> appears extremely likely, preferably in 319, since Constantine's presence in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> can be established for July 1 and 30.</p>
            <p>Next we turn to the Frg. Vat. 274 of August 13. The subscription runs <hi rend="italic">"data idibus augustis Romae Constantino et Licinio augg conss."</hi> As the consulships are unspecified, the theoretically possible years are 312, 313 and 315.<ref target="#CH5-n131">

Thus our interpretation of the date of this fragment entirely depends on our interpretation of the general course of events.</p>
            <p>Another fragment, Frg. Vat. 33, has the subscription <hi rend="italic">"proposita idib Aug Romae Constantino et Licinio augg IIII conss."</hi> That this decree was issued not more than a few days before August 13, is clear.<ref target="#CH5-n132">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> The inconsistency of the Vatican fragments as regards the recording of consulates makes it very difficult to establish the correct dates. Seeck<ref target="#CH5-n133">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> therefore proposes a choice of any one of the years 312, 313, 315 and 319 (<hi rend="italic">Constantino A V et Licinio Caes conss)</hi>. Thus 312 appears to be a possible date also for this fragment.</p>
            <pb n="35"/>
            <p>Three more items in the Theodosian Code establish Constantine in Rome at 315, namely XI 30, 3 (August 25), I 2, 2 (<hi rend="italic">propositum</hi> on August 29) and X 1, 1 (September 18). The dating appears to be in order. Accordingly we have to accept them as proofs that Constantine stayed at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> at least during the time August 25 âSeptember 18, 315.</p>
            <p>Before concluding this negative chronological argument, we should consider evidence in favor of his staying elsewhere. That is, what evidence can be brought forward to show his movements in the early part of 315 ? Four dates can apparently be established, March 21 in Cabillunum, April 28, June 1 and August 3 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>. The date of the Emperor's visit to Cabillunum rests on CTh IX 40, 2. Seeck<ref target="#CH5-n134">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> refuses to accept the consulships <hi rend="italic">Constantino A IIII et Licinio IIII</hi> as genuine because, according to him, Constantine was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> at that time.

            </p>
            <p>The date June 1 is recorded in CTh XIII 5, 2, which gives the fourth consulships of Constantine and <persName>Licinius</persName>. Seeck, assuming Constantine to have been in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> at the time, was forced to alter the year to 314.<ref target="#CH5-n139">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>August 3 is the date of CTh I 16, 1 recording the fourth consulates of Constantine and <persName>Licinius</persName>. Seeck<ref target="#CH5-n140">

               </ref> is compelled to alter the dating to <hi rend="italic">Constantino et Licinio conss</hi> because of the supposed decennial celebrations in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> at that time. Again there is no necessity to take such an extraordinary step, since the Emperor cannot be proved to have been elsewhere at that time. We may thus conclude that Constantine celebrated his initial <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> on July 25 and travelled south in early August to be in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> not later than August 25.</p>
            <pb n="36"/>
            <p>The dates of the Theodosian Code are highly controversial for the years 318â319. Of fifty-six decrees fifty-two have the dating of 319, <hi rend="italic">Constantino A V et Licinio C conss</hi>, whereas only one is dated with <hi rend="italic">Licinio V et Crispo C conss</hi>.<ref target="#CH5-n141">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Seeck decided that two series of decrees had been confused and endeavoured to reconstruct the itinerary of the Emperor with the aid of addressees, acting under the assumption that the name of an addressee was less likely to be corrupt than the subscription.</p>
            <p>The urban prefect Septimius Bassus, who held office from May 15, 317 to August 31, 319, is the addressee of several of the constitutions in question. This implies that no decree directed to Bassus in his capacity of <hi rend="italic">praefectus urbi</hi> can be later than August 31, 319; thus we are compelled to alter the year of CTh III 17, 1, given at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, to 318. In actual fact, similar alterations of the dates of several other constitutions appear necessary; it would be unnatural if no decrees had been issued in 318. One particular case illustrates how a dating with a Licinian consulate might have been altered. CTh XI 29, 2 gives <hi rend="italic">Constantino A V et Licinio C conss</hi>, whereas the corresponding CIust III 11, 3, from a different source than the present day version of CTh, records the probably correct <hi rend="italic">Licinio V et Crispo</hi>. On the whole, however, the reconstruction of the Emperor's itinerary should be made warily, with due regard to the prosopographical implications.</p>
            <p>Accepting the Emperor as staying in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> on October 12, 318, we may also accept Seeck's theory concerning the dates and the places of issue of the following decrees:<ref target="#CH5-n142">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> CTh XI 30, 9 (June 22, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>), XII 1, 6 (July 1, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>), VIII 17, 2 (September 7, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mediolanum">Milan</placeName>). The three constitutions by Seeck recorded from the end of the year 318, CTh II 6, 2 (October 24, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>), V 2, 1 (December 1, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>) and XIV 25, 1 (December 12, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>) create some difficulties if we maintain that Constantine celebrated his <hi rend="italic">processus consularis</hi> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> on the New Year 319. Seeck's arrangement means that the Emperor had left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> by the autumn 318 and was moving east. The crucial one of these three decrees is CTh XIV 25, 1, addressed to the <hi rend="italic">proconsul Africae</hi> Aconius Catullinus. Here Seeck

The date appears to be in order, but the place of issue, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>, is impossible at so early a juncture. This difficulty can be eliminated by reverting to Seeck's expedient in another context<ref target="#CH5-n151">

He also alters the consular dating to <hi rend="italic">ipso A et C conss</hi> although the ms. records <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VII et Constante</hi> conss.<ref target="#CH5-n152">

            <p>We may now conclude that Constantine spent the end of the year 319 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> ; there is no necessity to consider the two constitutions dated October 24 and directed to Felix, <hi rend="italic">praeses Corsicae</hi>, as belonging to 318, for the only evidence of an official with that title rests with the constitutions addressed to Felix (CTh I 16, 3; II 6, 2)<ref target="#CH5-n153">

            <p>With the Emperor's whereabouts for the end of 319 established, two points of the itinerary proposed by Seeck involve some difficulties, namely the two constitutions of July 25, 319, issued at Naissus (CTh II 15, 1 and II 16, 2).<ref target="#CH5-n156">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> The latter, directed <hi rend="italic">ad Bassum</hi> is simple to deal with. The inference of Seeck and <persName>Mommsen-Meyer</persName> that this Bassus was the urban prefect of 317/319 is supported solely by the comments of the <hi rend="italic">O(xonianus Bodleianus Seldenianus</hi> B 16) ms. which states <hi rend="italic">"Ad Bassum intellege praefectum urbi</hi>."<ref target="#CH5-n157">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> As the ms. identifies Bassus with the urban prefect, the compiler necessarily must have altered the dating, for this is the only ms. giving the consulships as <hi rend="italic">Constantino A IIII et Licinio conss</hi>, probably instead of <hi rend="italic">Constantino A IIIII et Licinio C conss</hi>. In other mss. the consulships are given as <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VIII et Constantio</hi> C, obviously the dating of 329 (<hi rend="italic">Constantino A VIII et Constantino C IIII)</hi>. Thus the real slip is confined to <hi rend="italic">Constantio</hi> (pro <hi rend="italic">Constantino C)</hi>. <persName>Mommsen- Meyer</persName>, however, both in their comments and in their introduction<ref target="#CH5-n158">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> regard the consulships of the vast majority of the mss. (NBGEPMLS) as a later interpolation necessitated by the fact that CTh II 16, 1 has been securely dated to 326. The above discussion has shown that this interpretation cannot be valid, that the correct date of CTh II 16, 2 is 329, and that the Bassus in question was the pretorian prefect of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> Iunius Bassus,<ref target="#CH5-n159">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The second constitution is directed <hi rend="italic">"Ad Symmachum vicarium</hi>" (CTh II 15, 1). On formal grounds no objections can be raised against it: a Symmachus is known from February 4, 318 (CTh II 4,<ref target="#CH5-n161">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> 1), and this decree is cited in another of October 12 of the same year (CTh III 17, 1). The dating appears to be correct, too. Nevertheless, as we are compelled to move CTh II 16, 2 to 329, the same should be done with CTh II 15, 1, because it would be highly unlikely that the Emperor should have stayed twice on exactly the same day in such a small township as Naissus (despite the fact that it was his birthplace; on the other hand, Constantine does not seem to have attached much
<pb n="40"/>
importance to this. Other cities were renamed after him or after members of his family, Cirta-Constantina in Africa, Arelate-Con- stantina in Gaul, Byzantium - Constantinopolis, Helenopolis, the new foundation at the Propontis, but not Naissus), and because Constantine, even regardless of these two decrees is known to have been in Naissus in 329 (CTh XI 27, 1 of May 13).<ref target="#CH5-n162">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> In addition it should be mentioned that Symmachus by 329 must have been a man of considerable standing; he was one of the consuls of 330. The character of his office, by CTh II 15, 1 recorded with <hi rend="italic">vicarius</hi> only, is uncertain. The necessity to alter the Imperial consulships recorded is no serious obstacle for our arrangement, particularly if one considers the unreliability of the records concerning the consulates of the Imperial Houses.</p>
            <p>It remains to discuss the CTh IX 37, 1 issued at Serdica on November 26, addressed to a certain Ianuarinus. First of all the proper dates should be restored to the CTh V 10, 1 of August 18, and the CTh XII 1, 16 of September 29, both issued at Serdica. The consulates recorded are correct for 329 except for the slight error <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VIIII et Constantio IIII conss</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VIII et Constantino C IIII</hi>.<ref target="#CH5-n163">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Formally the date of CTh IX 37, 1 is in order, but physically it is impossible for the Emperor to have been in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> on October 24, 319 (CTh I 16, 3), in Serdica on November 26 and anew in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> on December 1 (CTh V 2, 1). This must be explained as a case of an omitted postconsulate.<ref target="#CH5-n164">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> This would give us the year 320, the end of which the Emperor spent in this important city. The fact that we have a decree (CTh IX 34, 3) addressed to the same Ianuarinus and posted on December 4, 320 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> (thus issued in November ?) makes the likelihood of this arrangement even greater. Furthermore, both deal with actions at law, CTh IX 34, 3 with defamatory writings and CTh IX 37, 1 with annulments of suits.</p>
            <p>The constitutions discussed show that Constantine spent the entire year 320 in Serdica except on two possible occasions, May 22 (CTh IX 1, 5) and July 22 (CTh XV 1, 4). Now the consular dating of the
<pb n="41"/>
former is <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VII et Constantio C conss</hi>, the correct formula of 326. Although the years 320 and 326 are easily confused<ref target="#CH5-n165">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>, there seems to be no reason for an alteration in this case. It is true that the editions of CTh record the addressee as Maximus <hi rend="italic">p</hi>(raefectus) <hi rend="italic">u(rbi</hi>), and that a Maximus (Valerius Maximus Basilius) held that office from September 1, 319 to September 12, 323. On the other hand, two generally reliable mss., B and N,<ref target="#CH5-n166">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> record the office as <hi rend="italic">P(raefectus) p(raetori</hi>)o. This reading has not been accepted though it offers a far easier solution of the problem of the decree than either the acceptance of the date or the insertion of a <hi rend="italic">p</hi>(ost) <hi rend="italic">c</hi>(onsulatum) in the subscription. As, however, the decree was accepted, and accordingly posted in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, this implies that the pretorian prefect must have been the administrative head of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>. According to Seeck<ref target="#CH5-n167">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> such was not the case, since starting from the appointment of Rufinus (from December 1, 318 according to Seeck, from the same day in 319 according to me)<ref target="#CH5-n168">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> we get pretorian prefects in Africa, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> and Gaul.<ref target="#CH5-n169">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> This, however, appears to be a misinterpretation of the evidence although the persons referred to by Seeck must have been officials of considerable standing. Neither Menandros (June 22, 320âJuly 6, 322, in Africa), nor Acilius Severas (December 18, 322âJanuary 23, 324, in Gaul), nor Volusianus (August 1, 321, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>) is addressed as pretorian prefect in any constitution in CTh. The only official referred to in that capacity is actually Vettius Rufinus, and Seeck justly remarks that his tenure of office appears to coincide with Crispus' first command in Gaul.<ref target="#CH5-n170">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> Seeck argues further that the custom of addressing a decree to a pretorian prefect became necessary when the number of prefectures was increased and the holders were acting far away from the court. As long as there had been one prefect only there had been no need to direct decrees expressly to him. Obviously Vettius Rufinus created a precedent, and when after the defeat of <persName>Licinius</persName> the East fell to Constantine, and the pretorian prefects necessarily must have been two,<ref target="#CH5-n171">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> the custom adopted during his tenure of office was developed further. Ulpius Maximus appears to have been the Western
<pb n="42"/>
prefect in charge both of Gaul and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, and this accounts for the decree having been posted in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, although Maximus later appears solely in his capacity of <hi rend="italic">praefectus praetorio Galliarum</hi>.</p>
            <p>The second constitution mentioned (CTh XV 1, 4) is more easily dealt with. Despite the physical impossibility that Constantine stayed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> on July 22, 320, it is more natural to regard CTh XV 1, 4 as a case of an omitted postconsulate and date it as 321. The subscription is also otherwise corrupt with <hi rend="italic">Constantino A IIII et Constantio C conss</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">Constantio A VI et Constantino C conss</hi>.</p>
            <p>For the year 326 Seeck<ref target="#CH5-n172">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> records two constitutions (CTh IX 24, 1 of April 1, and CTh IX 8, 1) which, if correctly dated would be incompatible with the decree CTh IX 1, 5 addressed to Ulpius Maximus, considered above. The addressee of the latter is Bassus, <hi rend="italic">vicarius Italiae</hi>, this being the only constitution where he is referred to in this capacity. This Bassus must be Iunius Bassus, <hi rend="italic">praefectus praetorio Italiae</hi> in 329 and consul in 331.<ref target="#CH5-n173">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> The only evidence that he was <hi rend="italic">vicarius Italiae</hi> is CTh IX 8, 1. Thus the other decrees mentioning a Bassus (possibly Septimius Bassus, the former urban prefect) do not prevent us from redating this decree as 318, when Constantine's presence in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> is otherwise firmly attested. The list of <hi rend="italic">vicarii Italiae</hi> as recorded by Seeck<ref target="#CH5-n174">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> is headed by Iulius Severus, first in evidence on June 27, 318. That Iunius Bassus was the first <hi rend="italic">vicarius Italiae</hi> is thus very likely. This arrangement implies that the subscription of CTh IX 8, 1 is restored as <hi rend="italic">Licinio A V et Crispo C conss</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VII et Constantio Caes conss</hi> in the present day editions.</p>
            <p>The unreliability of the Imperial consulships as recorded by CTh has been demonstrated fully before and stressed by all editors. An extract of the <hi rend="italic">apparatus criticus</hi> of the Mommsen-Meyer edition goes to show how much at variance the textual tradition is:
<q>"Constantino (constantio <hi rend="italic">PM</hi>, const. <hi rend="italic">C</hi> ) a (o<hi rend="italic">m.

            </p>
            <p>The second Aquileian constitution CTh IX 24, 1 is closely connected with the one discussed above, both with regard to content, place and date of issue. The proper year is accordingly 318.</p>
            <pb n="43"/>
            <p>With regard to the constitutions of later years we may in passing note that the proper year for CTh XII 5, 1<ref target="#CH5-n175">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> is 327, the constitution being probably a case of an omitted postconsulate, and restore CTh XI 7, 4 and IX 12, 2 to their proper dates, those indicated in the subscriptions, i.e. the years 327 and 326, respectively.<ref target="#CH5-n176">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Similarly the date of CTh VI 1, 4, by the manuscript given as June 27, 317, can be maintained despite Seeck's attempts to change it to 330.</p>

               <p>The archives of Constantinople obviously were the foremost source, but particularly the selection of the material of early date shows that a considerable number of the consitutions were not to be found in the capital. Material from other places must therefore be brought together, and the compilers in some instances most certainly had to be satisfied with incomplete constitutions (cf. Seeck, op. 2ff.).</p>

               <p>If we approach the chronological problem from the numismatic angle, the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, of course, comes first. As <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> was the only mint to strike gold for Constantine in the five first years of his reign, we have little reason to go into details of internal chronology. Suffice it to say that the earliest group comprised aurei marked TR depicting Constantine as Caesar, the second solidi marked PTR showing Constantine as Augustus. The latter group was struck in the years immediately preceding the Italian campaign.<ref target="#CH6-n183">

               <p>The next Treveran group of gold coins is different in many respects, the flan larger and thinner, the relief flat, the portrait broad and squarish. To this group belong the dateable gold pieces commemorating both the fourth consulate and the <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> of the Emperor, although certain types appear to have been struck before these years (315âJuly 316). However, before dealing with this group of coins it seems appropriate to study the early Italian gold coins struck by Constantine.</p>

               <p>We note that all the types of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ostia">Ostia</placeName> had Treveran prototypes,<ref target="#CH6-n188">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                     <placeName>Victoria</placeName> Constantini aug</hi> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and the <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> of Ostia have obverses of Daza also. The parallelism of types indicates that the coins were struck in accordance with models brought to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>. As most of the types are very scarce â of some of them a single specimen only is knownâit is impossible to draw any conclusions on the basis of the absence of some of the Treveran types. The coin with the <hi rend="italic">vot x (suscepta)</hi> proves the date at least of the vota coin itself, i.e., prior to the expiration of the <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> (March 31, 312).<ref target="#CH6-n189">

               <p>This survey suggests that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and Ostia were the first Italian mints to coin Constantinian gold, that the first solidi in these mints were struck before the end of March 312<ref target="#CH6-n191">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>, and that all types were reproductions of types previously struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>. The first solidi of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> were struck later, possibly in connection with the conference at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mediolanum">Milan</placeName>. The magnificent gold multiple announcing the <hi rend="italic">Adventus</hi> (64) of the two Augusti points to this date. The new types demonstrate that the die-cutters could work at ease, that the authorities responsible for the medallic propaganda had had an opportunity to adapt the imagery according to the requirements of the day.

Of the Ticinese <hi rend="italic">Victoriae laetae</hi> with either <hi rend="italic">vot x</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vot PR</hi> the former variety could be regarded as an instance of "anachronistic" reverses; the type could have been brought to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> to be mechanically and thoughtlessly copied at first until it was refashioned with the insertion of the <hi rend="italic">vot PR</hi>.<ref target="#CH6-n192">

               <p>Thus at this early stage of Constantine's career we can see how the gold minting followed in the Emperor's tracks, from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and Ostia, and finally to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>.<ref target="#CH6-n193">

               <p>The session at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mediolanum">Milan</placeName> was not a long one. Germanic tribes threatened the Rhine frontier and Constantine left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> in the Spring 313. Uncertainty prevails as to the way he chose when travelling to Gaul and the time of his arrival in the Gallic capital. It is tempting to assume that he journeyed by way of Southern Gaul, i.e. Arelate, and to regard the first solidi of the mint of Arelate as struck during a visit of the Emperor to the mint city, but, as Constantine's presence in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mediolanum">Milan</placeName> is attested for March 10, 313, his visit to Arelate would have taken place in the end of March or the beginning of April.<ref target="#CH6-n194">

                  </ref> A possible alternate interpretation regarding the early solidi of small module from Arelate is that Constantine slightly later, the same year or early 314, paid a visit to this city and that the unusual reverse types PRINCIPIS PROVIDENTISSIMI-SAPIENTIA (164) and the varieties of VIRTVS AVGVSTI (289) were struck then.<ref target="#CH6-n196">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> The unique character of the reverses cannot, I think, be explained except by assuming an Imperial visit to the mint city to have been the reason for creating them.</p>
               <p>The return of the Emperor to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> in 313 brought about a new period of gold coining in the Gallic capital. We cannot tell exactly when he took up residence in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, nor when the coining started. It is quite possible that this happened only after the Francian war. This is suggested by the rich array of consular coins and decennial types. Except for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>, no other mint struck anything corresponding. Thus the coins corroborate the results of our study of the Theodosian Code that Constantine celebrated his <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> for the first time in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, and travelled to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> only after August 3, 315.</p>
               <p>Constantine's stay at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> in 315 appears to have been of very short duration,<ref target="#CH6-n197">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> at any rate not long enough to make it worth while to bring the court and the administration down to the old capital. The absence of gold coins struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> would otherwise be inexplicable. His main reason for visiting <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> might have been the inauguration of his triumphal arch.</p>
               <p>Instead of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> became his residence, a fact amply attested by the rich issue of gold coinage. Comparing the Ticinese gold types with the earlier Treveran ones, we find two different groups:</p>

               <p>

The following issue, marked PT, is shown by a</hi>

consular coin to have been struck within the same period. The PT coins were: <hi rend="italic">Gaudium Romanorum[Franc et Alam, Pm trib p cos IIII pp procos, Restitutor libertatis</hi> (Emp. seat. w. parazonium, 167), <hi rend="italic">Victore aug n votis/x mul xx</hi>. The two former types were struck with the well-known facing busts.</p>
               <p>The next mark, Â·Î¤Â·, known from one type only, FELICIA TEMPORA (56), was probably struck for the New Year 316<ref target="#CH6-n200">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> both with a nimbate, facing portrait (without consular attributes) and with an ordinary laureate head. Next we get the S Â· Î Â· T, dateable by a vota coin to the decennial year.

               <p>The last group, closely connected with the previous ones, was marked SMT, like the first issue, and comprised the following types: <hi rend="italic">Fortunae reduci</hi> (82), <hi rend="italic">Gaudium Romanorum</hi> (Sold, dragg. capt. to Emp.), <hi rend="italic">Liberalitas XI imp IIII cos ppp</hi> (120),<ref target="#CH6-n201">

               <p>Analyzing this list of reverse types we find Treveran influence gradually weakening. All solidi of the first series had their counterparts in the earlier Treveran coinage, the second phase of coining introduces the new facing portrait and, for the old legend <hi rend="italic">Restitutori libertatis</hi>, a new imagery. The symbolism of the few coins marked Â·TÂ· is new in the Constantinian coinage, as are two of the three types of the following issue. In the last series, the second SMT issue, only the legends remind us of the Treveran gold coinage, whereas a number of types were continued later in other mints.</p>
               <p>The fact that no obverses of the Caesars appear in the Ticinese coinage during any of the series mentioned shows that they all were issued before the settlement at Serdica, probably even before the New Year 317.</p>

                  <p>It is, of course fairly difficult to establish the exact time when gold minting was discontinued at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>. I have earlier contended that this probably happened after the Italian campaign, i.e., that, e.g., the <hi rend="italic">SPQR optimo principi</hi> and the vota coins with the later obv. break CONSTANTI-NVS PF AVG were struck after the battle of the Milvian Bridge, but before the expiry of the <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> on March 31, 312. This is not necessarily correct, though there is no doubt as to the chronological significance of the two obv. breaks N-T and T-I. Gold coining possibly continued in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> until the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> could start supplying Constantine with cash in that precious metal; there might even have been some overlapping as regards coining in these two mints. I cannot believe that the personnel of any one mint, nor even certain groups of workers in precious metals, were transferred to other mints as long as their original mint continued to work, except in special cases (cf. Mrs. AlfÃ¶ldi, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, p. 109, note 55). Otherwise it would be very difficult to account for the individual style of the mints.</p>

               <p>Gold coining at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> was discontinued for the obvious reason that the court, the administrative center, owing to Constantine's successful campaign against <persName>Licinius</persName>, followed the Emperor north to Siscia. Here a scarce issue of gold, a 1Â½ solidus and an aureus of the reverse legend <hi rend="italic">Soli invicto comiti</hi> (195), both marked Â·SISÂ· reflect the Ticinese <hi rend="italic">Soli comiti constantini aug</hi> (193) as, indeed, does the nimbate and facing bust of the aureus.<ref target="#CH6-n202">

The portrait enables us to interpret the exergual letters as <hi rend="italic">P(ercussa) S(isciae)</hi>.

               <p>Before following the travels of the Emperor and the court any further, a few words should be devoted to the gold struck in Gaul at this time. Both Arelate and Treveri were coining, the former mint for a short period only. Two types common both for the West and for the East, originating in Ticinese solidi of the second SMT issue, illustrate how the central mint distributed prototypes as modified versions of the original reverses. The <hi rend="italic">Virtus exercitus Gall</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Virtus augusti n</hi> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>) was struck at Arelate (304), <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> (303), Siscia (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 305) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (306), the <hi rend="italic">Felicitas perpetua</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">saeculi (Soli comiti Constantini aug</hi> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> ) at Arelate (59) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 60). These two were the only later gold types of Arelate, whereas the Treveran gold coinage was more varied, and included also special types for the Caesars. Some of the types of 316â317 were clearly influenced by earlier Ticinese types. The chief Gallic mint, however, retained a very high degree of independence until the last years of Constantine's life, possibly owing to the fact that Crispus in 318 was given the <hi rend="italic">praefectura Galliarum</hi> (after Civil War II Constantine II was in charge of Gaul). The mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> can therefore be disregarded in the sequel.</p>
               <p>To return to the Danube provinces, the court and Constantine can scarcely have stayed long in Siscia, and on March 1 the literary sources attest the Emperor's presence at Serdica for the reconciliation with <persName>Licinius</persName>. The peace treaty was confirmed by the nomination of the three Caesars, Crispus, <persName>Licinius</persName> II and Constantine II. <persName>Licinius</persName> gave up his European provinces except for the Thracian diocese. On the other hand, Constantine did not succeed in keeping all the territory he had conquered during the war.<ref target="#CH6-n205">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> An important result of Civil War I was that <persName>Licinius</persName> was forced to resign his legislative powers ; from now on the Eastern Augustus was restricted to distributing and enforcing the laws and edicts of Constantine.<ref target="#CH6-n206">

               <p>Once more it is highly instructive to compare the reverse types of the mint in question with the types of the immediately preceding time, in this case struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>.</p>

               <p>Only a few specimens are known of each type. It is possible that the correspondence between the Ticinese and Thessalonican types was even more complete than the list suggests. Clearly here is another case of models brought from one mint to another. The two vota types are of particular interest, partly because both were struck after the actual decennial year, partly because of the significant singular <hi rend="italic">aug</hi>. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> struck the <hi rend="italic">Victoriae laetae</hi> type with the plural <hi rend="italic">augg nn</hi>, whereas <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> used <hi rend="italic">aug n</hi>, thus showing that the legend must have been altered before the peace treaty of 317. The "anachronism" of a decennial type being struck after the decennial year is explained by the celerity employed when starting the Constantinian issues at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>.</p>
               <p>From <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> the central mint moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>. The exact time is in doubt, but although gold issues of the years 319â322 are known from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> also and from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>, the fact that the Emperor's fifth consulate (in 319) was celebrated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> only (73),
<pb n="57"/>
makes it a fair inference that the consular coin was struck for the New Year 319. An <hi rend="italic">Adventus</hi> coin of the same mint (2) implies that the <hi rend="italic">processus consularis</hi> that year took place in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia.1</placeName> The heavy multiple FELICIA/TEMPORA with the exceptional mintmark MAQ (57) expressing a New Year's wish<ref target="#CH6-n211">

                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> Generally speaking, my survey of the Imperial constitutions has shown that the Emperor spent almost all the year 318 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, 319 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> and 320 in Serdica. The last Serdican decree (of this period) was issued in February 321. On April 4 his presence is established in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>, and in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> he appears to have remained until July 20, 322 with a necessary break for the Sarmatian War. After the war he returned to his residence, but in the autumn he starts moving; in December he is in Serdica, in February 323 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> preparing the Gothic War, in April he violates Licinian territory when marching against his enemies. The victory must have been easily won, because on May 25 he is back in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>. By now it is clear that an open war against <persName>Licinius</persName> is unavoidable, and the seriousness of the situation is stressed in a letter to Helpidius (CTh XVI 2, 5), in which Constantine threatens severe punishment to any official found guilty of such anti-Christian measures as evinced during <persName>Licinius'</persName> quindecennial celebrations (November 322). In early Spring 324 (after January 23) the Emperor moves south, making <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> his military headquarters. War breaks out and in July we have the first encounter between the Emperors at Hadrianople.</p>
               <p>Let us now view the coinage against the background of Constantine's itinerary. Constantine and, with him, the central administration stayed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> during all 318, in so far as the Emperor's movements during this year can be traced. Very likely gold coining started in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> the same year, logically with the <hi rend="italic">Adventus</hi> (2) type (the type <hi rend="italic">

an end with the consular coin and the multiple honoring <persName>Licinius</persName> II, both issued for the New Year. Very soon after the celebrations of the New Year, Constantine left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>. The central administration, except for the officials travelling in the Imperial suite, remained behind, and actually were transferred to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>. It is quite likely that no gold was issued for a while; the new types to be struck during the following bout of coining had to be planned, designed and executed. Towards the end of the year (319) an impressive series of gold, solidi as well as multiples, was issued. <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos vi aug n</hi> (75) gives the date, New Year 320. The friendly relations with the fellow-ruler <persName>Licinius</persName> are eloquently illustrated by the multiple <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> (114) with Licinian obverse, by the type <hi rend="italic">Concordia augg nn</hi> with obverses of both Augusti and Crispus (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 8; 9â10), and by the plurality of Augusti stressed in reverse legends such as <hi rend="italic">Virtus augg nn</hi> (288), <hi rend="italic">Victorib augg et caess nn/ vot xx</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps"> (PLATE</hi> III, 279). The vota coins recording the <hi rend="italic">vota vicennalia suscepta</hi> (277) give us the <hi rend="italic">terminus post</hi> for the end of this gold issue, July 25, 320. It may be noted that Sol still appears to be the tutelary god of the Emperor (the multiple <hi rend="italic">Soli invicto comiti</hi>, 197, the solidus <hi rend="italic">Soli comiti aug n</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 189).</p>
               <p>However, few older types were represented in the Ticinese issue of 320/321. The <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince hold. spear and globe, 135) and the two Sol types both represent old type stock; the new types, however, were distributed farther from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>. The <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos vi aug n</hi> was struck both in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> (76) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> (74, 77), where the <hi rend="italic">processus consularis</hi> of the year must have taken place.

               <p>Constantine spent almost the whole year 320 in Serdica, probably reorganizing the frontier defense and preparing the Sarmatian War. To have a central administration in faraway <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> must have been a serious disadvantage, and in the later part of 320 the court moved north and made <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> its residence. According to a preconceived plan Constantine joined the court in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> in early 321. About the same time, if not earlier for the consular procession at New Year, his sons, the Caesars Crispus and Constantine II had arrived for their quinquennial celebrations. Hence the medallion <hi rend="italic">Felix adventus caess nn</hi> (65). The center of gravity of the Sirmian gold issues belongs to the year 321/322 when the Caesars celebrated their consulates, the Augustus his expiring <hi rend="italic">quindecennalia</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 280) and the Caesars their <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 266; 267; 263; V, 264). The mint had, however, been opened well in advance of this festival year. The necessary arrangements had probably been made during Constantine's stay in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> in 320. The first Sirmian gold coins are from this year (m. m. Â· SIRM Â·) and reflect their Ticinese prototype <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos vi</hi> (74).<ref target="#CH6-n215">

               <p>The gold series of 321 demonstrate convincingly that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> now had become the center of the Constantinian Empire. Here, and here alone, the <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> of the Caesars were celebrated, here the consulships, here the arrival of the Caesars were commemorated on the gold coins. The types are, generally speaking, new. However, Constantine himself retains the Sol symbolism though in a fairly watered down version. That we now have reached the first year of tension between East and West can be seen in the wording of the reverses, <placeName>Victoria</placeName> (218) or <hi rend="italic">Virtus aug et caess</hi> (287) instead of the plurality of Augusti in <hi rend="italic">Victorib augg et caess nn/vot xx</hi>.

               <p>Although one new type was created, the 2-solidi piece <hi rend="italic">Pietas augusti n</hi> (125) â with an obvious reference to the capture of Byzantium and with a suggestion of the great future in store for that city<ref target="#CH6-n220">

I believe that two different groups can be distinguished representing successive stages of coining, the first comprising slightly anachronistic types created several years earlier, the second comprising comparatively recent inventions. To the first group I would refer the multiples <hi rend="italic">Crispus et Constantinus iun nobb caess</hi> (48), <hi rend="italic">Felix adventus aug n</hi> (63), <hi rend="italic">Securitas perpetuae</hi> (180), <hi rend="italic">

The second group would have the multiples <hi rend="italic">Crispus et Constantius nobb caess</hi> (51), <hi rend="italic">Pietas augusti n</hi> (125), and the solidi <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (Victory seat. on throne <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 22), <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (148), <hi rend="italic">Solus reipublicae</hi> (174), <hi rend="italic">Securitas reipublice</hi> (185), <hi rend="italic">Victor omnium gentium</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 209) and <hi rend="italic">Virtus Caesarin</hi> (294).

I therefore suggest that Constantine's expeditionary force had been equipped far in advance with
<pb n="62"/>
coin models in order that coining could start as soon as the mint was captured. On the other hand, the civilian administration followed slowly in the tracks of the Emperor, and its arrival at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> changed the types brought forth by the army into new up-to-date ones. Thus it seems that the financial administration, having created and distributed the types of 324 followed the Emperor to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> and from there to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia.1</placeName>
               </p>
               <p>The following bout of gold coining at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> bears the stamp of independence. A series of new types is created, the multiples paying homage to the senatorial (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 186) and equestrian estates (54) and to Roman glory (107), the solidi celebrating the <hi rend="italic">vicennalia</hi> (248) of the Emperor and the courage of the Caesars (295, 300). But before studying their echo in the West we should follow the way of the older types of the East, to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> struck no gold under <persName>Licinius</persName>, but immediately after Constantine's conquest of the East a short gold series marked SMKE was issued with (as far as our knowledge goes) the types <hi rend="italic">Concordia augg nn</hi> (14), <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (obv. of Constantius II, 149) and <hi rend="italic">Victorib augg et caess nn/vot xx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 282), all of them of old stock, the first and the third clearly "anachronistic." This suggests that the coins were issued already in 324. The second gold issue of Cyzicus (marked SMK) cannot be of much later date, as the <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> type (Prince hold. two standards, 150) seems to have disappeared finally about 326. The second reverse is the <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (Victory advancing l. holding wreath, 28) known previously from a Ticinese mule (26).</p>
               <p>The first small gold issue of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> gains in importance when compared with the three first Constantinian issues of Antioch.</p>

               <p>The frequent "anachronisms" such as the commemoration of the second consulships of Crispus and Constantine II in the year the Caesars actually held their third consulates and the <hi rend="italic">Concordia augg nn</hi>, show that gold coining was resumed as soon as possible after <persName>Licinius'</persName> defeat.<ref target="#CH6-n227">

                  </ref> The <hi rend="italic">Adventus</hi> coin assists greatly in explaining this phenomenon; I think it is almost certain that Constantine himself advanced as far as Antioch after the victory at Chrysopolis, and that the scanty gold issue of Cyzicus should be regarded as evidence for his travelling either to or from the East. Antioch was, after all, the capital of the East. A Church council convened in Antioch in DecemberâJanuary<ref target="#CH6-n228">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> (324â25) to prepare the council of the following summer. Possibly owing to interference on the part of the Emperor, plans were altered and, instead of the council of the Eastern church scheduled to meet at Ancyra, an ecumenical council was summoned at Nicaea. We have ample evidence of the interest the Emperor at this time took in matters concerning the Church.<ref target="#CH6-n229">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> Already for this reason a visit to Antioch might have appeared imperative to him. As a point of curiosity we may note that at approximately this time, the time of the Antiochene council, the last Sol type was issued, <hi rend="italic">Soli corniti aug n</hi>. Subsequently, until the last years of Constantine's life no gold was struck at Antioch.</p>
               <pb n="65"/>
               <p>We now return to the regions of the Bosporus, to Constantine's initial vicennial celebrations on July 25, 325. For this occasion the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> had created a number of special types, the majority of which, however, stressed less the Imperial anniversary than things Roman in general. But the <hi rend="italic">vicennalia</hi> were celebrated twice, for the second time a year later in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. The Roman gold of 326 (marked SMR) is very scarce, an indication of the short duration of the Emperor's stay in the old capital. Only two gold types are known, namely <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> (multiple, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 187) and <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Victoria</placeName> Constantini aug/vot xx</hi> (solidus, 247, and submultiple).</p>
               <p>Now the execution of these Roman gold pieces is truly remarkable. We note particularly the heavenward gazing portraits and the unusual arrangement of the obverse legend with <hi rend="italic">Constantinus</hi> along the left edge and <hi rend="italic">aug</hi> under the chin.<ref target="#CH6-n230">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> One other mint had previously employed exactly the same technique, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, on the <hi rend="italic">Equis Romanus</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 55) medallions,<ref target="#CH6-n231">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> which are closely connected with the <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> type. Also in point of style the resemblance is striking, and I regard it as quite possible that Constantine when visiting <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> in 326 brought ready-made dies with him from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. Again, the Nicomedian and Thessalonican multiples cannot be exactly contemporaneous; the <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> aurei of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 186) have a plain diademed upward looking head, the corresponding 3-solidi piece of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> a consular bust (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 188).</p>
               <p>Thus <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> struck for the vicennial year 325, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> for the consular year 326. The conclusion is evident ; on his way from Asia Minor to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> Constantine and, with him, the travelling mint, i.e. the travelling officials of the central mint administration stayed for a while in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> in early 326.</p>
               <p>Before we follow Constantine on his journey to the West we should deal with a short but important Thessalonican issue, exceptionally marked THES. A submultiple of the reverse <placeName>Victoria</placeName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Constantini aug/ vot xx</hi> (246) gives the general date, the vicennial year. Two other THES marked coins are known, the splendid multiples of the type <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince hold. standard, behind another standard,
<pb n="66"/>
151). The fact that no obverse of Crispus is known must be accidental. Thus we must conclude that the THES issue was struck in the Winter 325/326 before the SMTS issue with the <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> medallion.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> for the year 326 created an entirely new set of types depicting all rulers with diademed upward looking portraits. The reverse simply records the name of the ruler in question, the obverses have no legend at all. The type struck for Constantine shows two interlaced wreaths (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 23), the type designed for the Caesars, Crispus (44), Constantine II (35) and Constantius II (40), Victory advancing left, holding wreath and palm branch. This set of gold coins was probably issued at New Year at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> and, it seems, at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 36; 41) during the Emperor's short stay in the Macedonian capital.<ref target="#CH6-n232">

               <p>Constantine's journey to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> in 326 brought about a concentration of the gold coining in the East, or at least, in the mints close to the Bosporus. The mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> were closed, while coining at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> had been suspended slightly earlier.</p>
               <p>The Emperor returned from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> by way of Pannonia. On the last of December 326 he was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium;</placeName> a short issue, by the vota type <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis/vot xx</hi> (solidus, 162) dateable as 326â327 and including the medallions <hi rend="italic">Gloria Constantini aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 96) and <hi rend="italic">Virtus DN Constantini aug</hi> (301),<ref target="#CH6-n235">

               <p>Acting on instructions previously received, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> during the Emperor's absence issued a special type to the <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> of the Caesars, <hi rend="italic">Votis x caess nn</hi> (315).

               <p>The opening of the mint of Constantinople displays some unusual features. We know that the first bronze coins were struck in 326 at Constantinople, and one gold piece unequivocally belongs to the same year, namely the <hi rend="italic">Gloria Romanorum</hi> with an obverse depicting Crispus as consul (105). The disturbing feature is that we know of no precedent of this type, although the Crispus coin points to a prototype struck during Crispus' third consulship in 324. Connected with the vicennial celebrations of Constantine is the uninscribed reverse with the Emperor standing in a quadriga (318). The first Constantinopolitan gold series was probably issued before the mint had been wholly established; the personnel of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> appears to have been moved to the capital-to-be before the mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> were closed and transferred to the Bosporus.</p>
               <p>The first Constantinopolitan issue probably also comprising the reverses <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (27) and <hi rend="italic">Constantinus caes</hi> (34)<ref target="#CH6-n237">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> with diademed heads reminds us once more of the types created for 326 and brought by the Emperor to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> during his journey to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. True, the types survive for several years in Constantinople, but they lose their festival character, the obverses receive the ordinary legends, the busts become draped and cuirassed as was customary, Constantine wearing a rosette diadem, the Caesars laurel wreaths (e.g. 33).</p>
               <pb n="68"/>
               <p>During the busy years 327 (latter part)â330 (early part) <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> was the residence of the court and its mint the central mint of the Empire. Before the inauguration of Constantinople on May 11, 330 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> issued three gold series, the first reflecting the series struck slightly earlier at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. The multiples were <hi rend="italic">Gloria Romanorum</hi> (108), <hi rend="italic">Gloria Constantini aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 98), <hi rend="italic">Virtus Constantini caes</hi> (298) and <hi rend="italic">Virtus Constanti caes</hi> (Emperor advancing r., holding trophy and spear between two captives, 296), the only solidus type being the <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (Victory advancing l., holding trophy, 30) as in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. Not much later a multiple varying the same theme was issued but with a different mintmark <graphic url="NNM146_082.jpg"/> namely, <hi rend="italic">Gloria Constantini aug</hi> (Emperor standing between captives, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 99) and finally, on the eve of the dedication of the new capital, the rejoicing of the Empire was expressed in terms of the <hi rend="italic">Gaudium augusti nostri</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 83) and <hi rend="italic">Pietas augusti nostri</hi> (the latter struck both as multiple and solidus, 126). Here the creative phase of the <name type="place">Nicomedian</name> mint ends. This issue appears to have been continued to the twenty-fifth anniversary of Constantine's ascent to the throne, when a series of <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">aug/vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 255) was issued. The characteristic truncation of the obverse head as well as the short hair on the nape of the neck connects these coins with the previous issues and distinguishes them from the subsequent vota issues of 335â336 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 256â7).</p>
               <p>Before the responsibility of the central mint was conferred upon Constantinople, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_thracica">Heraclea</placeName> struck a group of gold. The 3-solidi piece <hi rend="italic">Salus et spes reipublicae</hi> (170) was shortly to be repeated in the new capital. The solidus type <hi rend="italic">Victor omnium gentium</hi> had been struck after Civil War II in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>, but the rosette diademed bust of Constantine indicates a later time of issue (210). The third type was <hi rend="italic">

That the types <hi rend="italic">Salus reipublicae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Securitas reipublice</hi> belong to this issue is also shown by a comparison with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>, where the issue preceding the N- marked coins comprised both the <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (Vict. seat. on throne, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 22) and the types of the Augustae (174, 185).</p>

                  <p>This solution implies that Constantine before his final victory over <persName>Licinius</persName> had planned to underline the importance of his dynasty by elevating his mother and wife to the rank of Augustae and his third son to the rank of Caesar, and to assume the oriental sign of sovereignty, the diadem.

                  <p>The fact that all the coins are solidi or multiples of the solidus (except the heavy <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos vi aug n)</hi> proves the coins to have been struck after Constantine's conquest. Strictly speaking this is not correct of the <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos ii. We</hi> know only a <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos iii</hi> of Crispus marked Â· SIRM Â· (in BM) and another marked SIRM (Hirsch XXIV 2613). In the Hunter coll. there is an irreg. <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos ii aug</hi> (68) of Const. II. This coin may, however, be a barb. copy (of distorted rev. leg.) of a regular Sirmian original. Because of the date clearly indicated on the consular coins they have caused confusion among scholars, and so Maurice was moved to declare them false <hi rend="italic">(Num. Const</hi>. III, pp. 198f.). On formal grounds there would be no objection to a legend recording a certain consulate (n) until the person in question acquired his following consulate (n+1.). Thus e.g. the consular legend COS VI for Constantine would be valid throughout 320â325 (incl.) until he in 326 entered his seventh consulship. In practice, however, the consulships recorded on the coins of the Constantinian epoch appear to have been struck in the actual year of office. Be that as it may, the consular coins recording the second consulships of the Caesars were outdated in the year 324. On the other hand, we know that Constantine's appointing of his sons as consuls for the year 321 actually broke off the friendly relations between Constantine and <persName>Licinius</persName> (Seeck, <hi rend="italic">Regesten</hi>, p. 172, my <hi rend="italic">Arelate</hi>, p. 33, also note 3) ; the latter did not accept the Western consuls, appointed himself and his son opposition consuls for this year, and started a consular reckoning according to the formula <hi rend="italic">consulibus quos iusserint dd nn</hi> (I, II, III and IV), cf. Kase, <hi rend="italic">P RollPrinc</hi>, p. 34. Clearly, the two consular coins cannot have been struck by <persName>Licinius</persName> â and on no account at solidus standards.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In connection with the inauguration of the new capital the central mint moves to Constantinople, a fact signalled by the reverse legend <hi rend="italic">Adventus augusti n</hi> (5). An impressive array of magnificent multiples is issued, the 30-solidi piece <hi rend="italic">Gaudium Romanorum</hi> (90), the 9-solidi <hi rend="italic">Salus et spes reipublicae</hi> (171) and the 3-solidi <hi rend="italic">Gaudium augusti nostri</hi> (84), a link with the preceding issue of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>. The ordinary solidi continue the series issued in 327 with Victory advancing l., holding wreath and palm branch. The reverses include individual legends for each ruler (33, 39). At this juncture the first Constantinopolitan <hi rend="italic">vot xxx (suscepta)</hi> appears to have been struck; the only solidus known (252) has an anachronistic consular bust, a reminder of Constantine's eighth consulship in 329. The corresponding sub-multiple (253), the first one to be struck, employed the obverse legend CONSTANTINVS AVG, whereas all others regardless of mint subsequently used CONSTANTINVS MAX AVG (258).</p>
               <p>For the following years we have but scanty information on the Emperor's whereabouts. Most of the notices put him in Constantinople. The gaps are considerable and give almost any amplitude for travels over large parts of his Empire. I record the most conspicuous ones below (according to Seeck's <hi rend="italic">Regesten</hi>) :</p>

               <p>Although the coin reverses now grow increasingly stereotyped, we occasionally get indisputable evidence of the Emperor's travels. The first after the celebrations in Constantinople â if we except some tricennial <hi rend="italic">vota suscepta</hi> both of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> (255) and Constantinople (252) struck July 25, 330/331 â is a Thessalonican issue (mintmark MTS) with a submultiple <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName> aug/vot xxx</hi> (258).<ref target="#CH6-n239">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> As important innovations in the same issue we may note the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName> aug</hi> (Victory advancing l., holding trophy, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 239), and <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince standing, holding <hi rend="italic">vexillum</hi>, behind two standards, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 154). The third solidus type is the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Victoria</placeName> caesarum</hi> (Victory advancing l., holding wreath, 223). The date of the following issue of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (marked TS), repeating the two former types (240, 155), is in doubt. A sojourn of Constantine in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> any of the years 332â334 is possible; the absence of Constans, however, in this rich issue, excludes the year 334, and this, I believe is as close as we can get the date.</p>
               <p>In the same years, i.e. in connection with Constans' elevation to the rank of <persName>Caesar</persName> and with Constantius' <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> we get the first gold issue of Constantinople after the inauguration of the city and after the first vota issue of 330â331. The former event is attested by the 9-solidi piece <hi rend="italic">Securitas perpetua</hi> (176), the latter by the solidus <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Victoria</placeName> Constanti caes/vot xv</hi> (225). That the sons of Constantine were in the foreground is further attested by the heavy medallions <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (152, no obverse of Constans known). With the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Gaudium augusti nostri</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 85)<ref target="#CH6-n240">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> no medallion obverse of Constantine is known. The solidi of this gold series were of the traditional type, Victory advancing l., holding wreath.</p>
               <p>Before we arrive at the special issues of the tricennial year we should mention a gold series struck at Siscia in 334,<ref target="#CH6-n241">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> comprising two

types introduced 331 at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName> aug</hi> (Victory advancing l., holding trophy, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 242), and <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince holding <hi rend="italic">vexillum</hi>, 157). The latter type was shared by Constans also.</p>
               <p>The tricennial issues are not easy to grasp. Rich series were minted at Siscia (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 249â50, 260), <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 256â7) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> and a very small one at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> (259). <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> struck a special type of medallion (316, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 317)&gt; but not the ordinary tricennial solidus. Finally Constantinople coined the unique <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName> aug/vot xxxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 262) together with the ordinary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName> aug/vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 254). We have, however, two different series of gold coins struck at Constantinople during the two last years of Constantine's life, the first continuing the traditional solidus type (Victory advancing l. with wreath) and introducing special types both for Constans (17) and Delmatius (53). This takes us past September 18, 335. The only vota type that possibly could belong to this series is the <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName> aug/ vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 254), but both stylistic criteria and the scarcity of the type refer it to the later vota issue of the summer 336. It would certainly have been unworthy of the occasion for Constantinople to coin so sparsely for the Augustus, had the first tricennial celebrations taken place in the Eastern capital.</p>
               <p>It now appears highly likely that he did not celebrate in Constantinople in 335 but in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>. This we can deduce from the enormous output of tricennial vota solidi, multiples, and special types of the latter mint.</p>
               <p>The <name type="place">Nicomedian</name> gold of 335 was probably struck in two phases, the first using the upward looking portraits (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 256), the second the diademed draped busts (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 257). Together with the vota type <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName> aug/vot xxx</hi> we find the magnificent multiple <hi rend="italic">Felicitas perpetua aug et caess nn</hi> (58), and the solidi <hi rend="italic">Virtus Constantini caes</hi> (299) and <hi rend="italic">Virtus Constanti caes</hi> (297).</p>
               <p>The belief that Constantine celebrated his initial <hi rend="italic">tricennalia</hi> at Constantinople has been deeply rooted and ultimately goes back to Eusebius' assertion that he read his eulogy to the Emperor in the Imperial Palace on this occasion.

               <p>The Emperor then returned to his capital.

               <p>The final gold coining at Constantinople followed in the summer of 336 for the second tricennial celebrations, comprising not only the <hi rend="italic">

               <p>It remains to account for two mints more or less out of touch â at least as far as gold coining goes â with the happenings in the rest of the Empire, namely, Antioch and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. Antioch ceased to issue gold after the coining of the winter and spring 324â325 and of early 326. During the tricennial year we find a series of solidi coined at the Syrian mint, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Victoria Constantini</persName> aug/vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 261) followed by some solidi of the reverses <hi rend="italic">

                     <placeName>Victoria</placeName> caesar nn</hi> (222, both: Victory advancing l., holding trophy). The solidi without vota must have been struck in the last year of Constantine, and both the series mentioned should be viewed in the light of the Sassanian war planned by Constantine (possibly also Calocaerus' rebellion) at the end of his reign. The tricennial series was preceded by a small issue of the reverse type "Victory advancing l., holding trophy," at first with the reverse legend <hi rend="italic">Con</hi>-

In addition some <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> solidi of the type "Prince holding <hi rend="italic">vexillum"</hi> (153) were struck. It is natural to assume that this series, also connected with the preparations for the war, was struck immediately before the tricennial year.

            </head>
            <p>To express in a few words the conclusions of the present study is quite impossible. In a way the preceding analysis has been a conclusion in itself, based on material collected and studied over a considerable time. Those trying to follow the arguments have probably been irritated by the summary account of the basic material, the coins, and by the scanty references to the pertinent collections, publications and sale catalogues. Nevertheless, scarcely any coin mentioned is unpublished.<ref target="#CH7-n254">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Summing up the results of the study of the relations between Constantine and <persName>Licinius</persName> as reflected in the coinage, we note that the bronze coinage is far more explicit than the gold coinage. The main reason is that bronze was struck continuously in most of the mints, whereas gold was issued sporadically and, generally speaking, only in one mint at a time. Of the two chronological problems discussed, the first regarding the date of Constantine's conquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> is solved mainly with the aid of the gold coinage; one of the fundamental dates in the history of Constantine, the year of the "victory of the cross," of the <name type="place">battle of the Milvian Bridge</name>, has to be altered to 311 from 312. The coins prove to be more accurate than the written tradition.</p>
            <p>The second problem is solved with the aid of the bronze coinage. The conclusions previously drawn from my study of the coinage of Arelate are strongly supported by the survey of the bronze coinages of other mints. True, the smaller mints yield but meager results â they were obviously out of touch with the politics of the dayâbut all major mints eloquently show how <persName>Licinius</persName> was eliminated from the Constantinian bronze coinage on the eve of the nomination of the Caesars, and how the Caesars actually were appointed before the settlement of Serdica on March 1, 317. The Licinian mints are equally outspoken and demonstrate how Constantine disappears from the
<pb n="76"/>
obverses and how <persName>Licinius</persName> stresses his sole-rulership, how in one case in the course of a single mintmark the reverse legend subsequently to this is altered to the plural <hi rend="italic">augg</hi> and Valens appears as second Augustus, and how, finally, with the same mintmark, Constantine reappears at the same time as the sons of the Augusti are introduced as Caesars. This mintmark certainly gives us the history of Civil War I in a nutshell.</p>
            <p>The revision of the dates of the Constantinian Civil Wars is the starting point for an investigation of the Constantinian financial administration.</p>
            <p>The main theory developed in this study is that gold coining<ref target="#CH7-n255">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> in the Constantinian Empire<ref target="#CH7-n256">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> was closely connected with the court and with the Emperor. As a rule gold was struck at the temporary residence of the Emperor. This implies that the administrator of the gold coinage, the organizer, was a <hi rend="italic">comitiva</hi> in the true sense of the word. Only in special cases, e.g., when the Emperor was campaigning and would have been hampered by bringing with him also a part of the civil administration, was the gold coining concentrated at the residence of the court left behind. Some instances of filial issues are known. In the years 320â321, e.g., we have parallel striking at three mints in the same area, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>, obviously necessitated by the military preparations of these years. The last Constantinian gold series of Antioch should be explained in the same way â if our conclusion that the Emperor did not visit <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> in 336 is correct.</p>
            <p>The fact that in almost every instance we may assume that the Emperor and the court directed the issues and almost supervised the execution in person gives added significance to the imagery, to the reverse legends, and to the slogans distributed by means of the coins. I have, however, refrained from attempting a new interpretation of the religious and political program of the Emperor in the light of the gold coinage. This important but arduous task is something for the future.</p>
            <p>The iconography, too, is likely to appear in new light when studied against the background of the mobile gold minting. This concerns
<pb n="77"/>
particularly such details as the development of the diadem, and the successive changes in the arrangement of the hair.</p>
            <p>No doubt the new insight we have won of the working of the financial administration is likely to increase our understanding of the economic life of the later Roman Empire. It is remarkable that we can trace no tendency to cater equally to all parts of the Empire: Spain and Africa struck no gold in Constantinian times, Egypt nothing (under Licinian rule a single issue was struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>), Antioch nothing during the years 327â335, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> after the close of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> nothing except some odd pieces in the last years of Constantine. One would have expected the central mint to have organized transports to far-away parts of the Empire, but it is obvious that the mobility of the gold minting increased the difficulties of segular service if, indeed, such service existed during the reign of Constantine. It appears that the local need of currency and cash was satisfied mainly by the bronze coinages.</p>

            <p>Late imperial Delos rests in the obscurity of oblivion unworthy of its great past. Never wholly recovering from the catastrophic destructions in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, the Roman (Hellenistic) way of life after the partial reconstruction nevertheless appears to have continued without noticeable break into Byzantine times.

            <p>No particular incident during the Late Empire is attached to the name of Delos. Life just went on, one hopes peacefully. Something of the mist of anonymity, however, is shattered by an early fourth century bronze hoard from Delos. Its very existence invites comments, its highly unusual composition seems to explain something of the circumstances surrounding its burial. Moreover, the hoard as such both sheds some light on Constantinian numismatic chronology, and is suggestive of a new methodological approach to coin hoards.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The large Delos hoard comprising 3797 mainly Constantinian bronze coins was catalogued by Svoronos in 1910,<ref target="#CH8-n262">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> unfortunately at a time when only the first volume of Maurice's <hi rend="italic">Numismatique Constantinienne</hi> had appeared (even if the majority of the mints had been described earlier in various learned journals). Thus an under-

standable lack of insight into the working of the early fourth century mints in an unfortunate way impaired the value of the work of the great Greek numismatist ; e. g. bust and reverse varieties were not recorded in sufficient detail according to present day standards. Printer's errors (?) in some cases had disastrous effects through the mechanical way of using repetitions as often as possible.</p>
               <p>The single coins of the hoard can therefore only hesitatingly be accepted as numismatic evidence, whereas the main groups, the general reverse types and the issues distinguished by mintmarks can be expected to serve some useful purpose. Immediately after the publication of the hoard, Kubitschek<ref target="#CH8-n263">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> drew attention to the fact that the hoard was an unusually closed one, the bulk of the coins having been struck during the years 308â318. In fact, a very negligible quantity of the coins exceeds these limits.</p>
               <p>The composition of the hoard presents some exceptional and interesting features. Kubitschek pointed out that the hoard, regardless of its site in the Greek archipelago<ref target="#CH8-n264">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, was formed in the West. The latest coins are the two Nicomedian ones marked <graphic url="NNM146_093.jpg"/> belonging to an issue initiated before Civil War II and struck during the war also. These coins are, however, the only ones struck by a Licinian mint after Civil War I, and they seem to be somewhat later than the rest of the coins.</p>
               <p>The character of the hoard emerges most clearly out of a study of the last coins of the Constantinian mints integrated with the hoard. Arranging the coins in chronologically significant groups we get the following subdivision:</p>
               <p>(a) marks and series with obverses of Constantine and <persName>Licinius</persName>, i. e. coins struck before the rupture between the two Augusti interpreted as a prelude to the Civil War (all the earliest coins inclusive of those from the early part of 316).</p>
               <p>(b) marks and series with obverses of Constantine alone. These coins show that the relations between the Augusti had been severed; the date is the later part of 316.</p>
               <pb n="80"/>
               <p>(c) marks and series with obverses of Constantine and his two sons. These coins were struck in the course of the War, when Constantine reacted to <persName>Licinius'</persName> appointment of Valens as Augustus by elevating his sons to princely rank. This happened in the Autumn of 316.<ref target="#CH8-n265">

               <p>(d) marks and series with obverses of Constantine, <persName>Licinius</persName> and their sons. These coins date from the time after the peace treaty and reconciliation at Serdica on 1 March, 317, a date confirmed by our literary sources.</p>

               <p>The most interesting feature of the hoard is probably its exceptional composition with its preponderance of coins struck in the West. Normally a hoard "stands in a certain ratio to the amount of the coinage during the period covered by the findâ¦ andâ¦ this proportion reaches increasing agreement the larger the find is numerically."<ref target="#CH8-n273">

"But," Thordeman continues, "this rule only applies to hoards which have been collected within the actual area in which the coins were currency." Now it is quite clear that the Delos hoard cannot reflect the coinage in circulation in Delos in the years after Civil War I. The circulation of the bronze coins was ordinarily restricted to the area surrounding the mint in question. This has been demonstrated in numerous cases, most recently probably for Gaul.<ref target="#CH8-n274">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> By common standards we would expect many more coins from the mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_thracica">Heraclea</placeName> to have belonged to the hoard, and particularly one would have expected the latest coins to be from the mints located nearest the island.</p>
               <p>An analysis of the hoard reveals that, except for the coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> (nos. 341â2, 847) which are according to the present writer the latest coins of the whole hoard, all coins struck during or after Civil War I had been issued in the Constantinian part of the Empire.<ref target="#CH8-n275">

               <p>Diocletian's reform of the provincial administration transformed <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi> into seven provinces, one of which was <hi rend="italic">Insulae</hi>, the province of Î½Î®ÏÏÎ½ ÎÏÎºÎ»Î¬Î´ÏÎ½ comprising 53 islands altogether.<ref target="#CH8-n276">

have taken place before that date. The exact time of the reform is uncertain, but Groag (p. 21) is probably correct in assuming that it took some time to complete the necessary arrangements.<ref target="#CH8-n280">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>In view of Delos' exceptional position in earlier times, it appears very likely that the island in the armistice of 317 was considered part of the Greek mainland and therefore in Constantine's provincial reform referred to <hi rend="italic">Achaia</hi>. On the other hand it should be remembered that Delos was practically surrounded by parts of the province <hi rend="italic">Insulae</hi> belonging to the Licinian diocese <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>.</p>
               <p>Now the hoard we are discussing was found buried in an earthenware jar. It therefore represents a treasure, the ready cash of an individual, a body or an institution.<ref target="#CH8-n281">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> The fact that the hoard is an exceptionally closed one suggests the bulk to be, basically, a kind of cash payment from a stock of bronze coins rather than a great number of coins gathered during a period of time. A further inference from the composition of the hoard is that the main part of it was formed outside Delos. Accepting the year 321, when the last Nicomedian coins were incorporated with the bronze treasure, as the approximate burial date,<ref target="#CH8-n282">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> we realize that it would have been abso

lutely impossible for so many Constantinian coins of Roman origin to flow to Delos through the ordinary channels. And if there had been regular connections with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>) rather than with the Greek mainland (and the nearest Constantinian mint, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>), why was the percentage of post-316 (groups câd) bronzes struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> so much lower than the corresponding figure of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica?</placeName> (Cf. the table above).</p>
               <p>The composition of the hoard seems to be most easily interpreted in the following way:</p>
               <p>The bulk of the hoard was received as a single sum somewhere in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> in 316 and this lot of bronze coins can be assumed to have mirrored faithfully the bronze coinage in circulation in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> at that timeâthe closer to the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> the sum was paid, the greater would be the proportion of recently struck coins issued by that mint, and the later the date.<ref target="#CH8-n283">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> In gradually decreasing proportions we would find coins of Ostia, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName>, the Gallic, the Balkan and the Eastern mints (probably not more than stray pieces of the latter).</p>
               <p>The recipient (presumably an army contingent) then was transferred to Gaul; the percentage of post-316 (groups câd) Arelatensian bronze coins together with the remarkably high number of coins of Arelate, points to the Via Aurelia as the travelling route up to Arelate.
<pb n="87"/>
Here additional cash was suppliedâalternatively the coins of Arelate naturally poured in by way of exchange.<ref target="#CH8-n284">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The small total number of Treveran coins (75 against 239 struck at Arelate) is particularly interesting in view of the fact that 54 pieces (72%) were post-316 (groups câd). Two explanations appear to be possible, either that the person or body in question travelled to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> but was forced to leave almost instantly, or that the army contingent staying in Arelate received reinforcements from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> and that some of the cash brought forth from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> trickled into the official treasure. At any rate, at a time suggested by the last date of the Gallic coins (probably 318) the contingent was dispatched to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> (57 coins, 44 of which are post-316 from groups câd), where mainly local coins trickled into the treasure, but also, in decreasing proportions, coins from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, Siscia, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> etc. This accounts for the post-316 coins from these mints (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> only 9 coins out of 2011 in the table above, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> 28 of 269â10.41%, Siscia 12 of 70â17.14%, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> 14 of 106â13.20%. The corresponding percentage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> is 77.19, the highest of any mint represented in the hoard).</p>
               <p>To this comes a lot of almost 300 bronze pieces (group b, cf. p. 79 above) struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> at a time when the bulk of the coins of this mint had already been incorporated in the treasure. The almost 300 coins in question were in my opinion struck during Civil War I fought between Autumn 316 and March 1, 317 and seem to have been shipped to Delos directly from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> (Brundisium, cf. p. 96 below). The bulk of the coins had left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> on the eve or in the early days of the war, while these coins were struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> later, but before the end of the war. The 9 post-316 (groups câd) coins are of later date.</p>
               <p>In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> the contingent embarked and headed for Delos. In Delos we would expect the coins in circulation to influence the composition of the hoard, and clear traces of the money market in Licinian times can be found. If we in the table above extract the coins struck by Licinian mints, we get a total of 361, less than 10% of the entire hoard. Some of these coins may well have slipped in at
<pb n="88"/>
earlier stages of the travel of the treasure, particularly at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, but the Cyzicene quota (116 coins) cannot be explained in this way. Again the fact that only three post-316 (groups câd) coins struck in the East were found in the hoard, shows that peaceful intercourse between Constantinian Delos and the surrounding islands of the Licinian province <hi rend="italic">Insulae</hi> was negligible.<ref target="#CH8-n285">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The majority of the 361 Licinian coins mentioned above must therefore have been in circulation on the island when the Constantinian garrison arrived.<ref target="#CH8-n286">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, we must assume that the Greek mainland kept in touch with Delos, and through this channel coins representative of the bronze coinage circulating in this area (mainly struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, but necessarily also to some extent of old Licinian stock) oozed forth into Delos to be added to the hoard. The isolation of Delos must, however, have been fairly complete in view of the chronological gap between the latest Constantinian coins and the latest coins of the hoard, the two Nicomedian coins mentioned above. Remarkably enough no Thessalonican coins of later date than the Sol coinage belonged to the hoard.<ref target="#CH8-n287">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>It remains to explain the burial of the hoard. Kubitschek (p. 52) suggested the Spring of 324 and connected the burial with Crispus' moving the Constantinian fleet from Achaia northwards. Although the relative isolation of Delos, stressed in the preceding paragraph, might account for the absence of any coins later than 320â321, and thus explain such a late burial date, the very reason for burying the coins remains obscure if Kubitschek's views are to be accepted. The present writer therefore prefers to regard the burial against the background of the tension between Constantine and <persName>Licinius</persName> gradually growing from late 320 onwards. Our knowledge of the prelude to Civil War II is scanty. We know of Constantine's Sarma-

tian War and of his violations of Licinian territory in the years preceding the Civil War. It would therefore be little surprising to find traces of similar actions along the sea frontier. Delos with its garrison must have been a thorn in the flesh to <persName>Licinius</persName>, a threat to the Licinian communications in the Aegaean, otherwise dominated by the East. It is feasible that a sudden raid finished the garrison on Delos; depending on our estimate of the burial date this raid could either be regarded as Licinian reprisals for Constantine's disregard of the division of the Empire as agreed upon at Serdica, or as the reason (or one of the reasons), for Constantine to operate with his army in Licinian <hi rend="italic">Thracia</hi>.</p>
               <p>Again, Constantine's decision to detach a contingent of his army to Delos<ref target="#CH8-n288">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> points to early planning of the second and decisive war against <persName>Licinius</persName>, and to an endeavour to use his bridgehead in the Licinian archipelago as well as possible.<ref target="#CH8-n289">

                  <p>Kubitschek (p. 52) suggests that the hoard was buried shortly before Civil War II, not later than the spring of 324 when the Constantinian fleet with Crispus as nominal commander set out against <persName>Licinius</persName> from Piraeus. This date is probably too late.</p>

                  <p>The main source recording Rufinus' career is <hi rend="italic">CIL</hi> X 5061 : "praefecto urbi, comiti Augg nn, corr. Camp., corr. Tusciae et Umbriae, corr. Venitiae <hi rend="italic">(sic)</hi> et Histriae, cur. alvei Tiberis et Cloacarum sacrae urbis, cur. viae Flaminiae, proconsuli provinciae Achaiae sortito, pontifici dei Solis, auguri, salio Palatinoâ¦" Groag, op. cit., pp. 17ff., however, connects a passage in Firmicus Matemus' <hi rend="italic">Mathesis</hi> (II 29,10, pp. 81ff., ed. Kroll-Skutsch) with Rufinus and his father: "eius geniturae pater post geminum ordinarium consulatum in exilium datus est, sed et ipse ob adulterii crimen in exilium datus et de exilio raptus in administrationem Campaniae primum destinatus est, deinde &lt;ad&gt; Achaiae proconsulatum, post vero ad Asiae proconsulatum et praefecturam urbi Romae." Groag appears to be correct in his interpretation of the father as the consul of 316 and 323 (despite the lacking iteration in the <hi rend="italic">Fasti)</hi> and the first praetorian prefect of Gaul, and the son as the urban prefect mentioned in the inscription quoted above. The details of the career of the younger Rufinus are, however, obscure. The fact that Atina, a Lucanian township, clearly hails him as its patron, its <hi rend="italic">corrector</hi>, but nevertheless omits the <hi rend="italic">correctura Lucaniae</hi>, entitles us, with Groag, to supply this office in the list and assign it to the time of Maxentius' usurpation. The wide range of offices held in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> excludes the possibility that he was in office in <hi rend="italic">Achaia</hi> in Diocletianic times (as suggested by C. Schuurmans, <hi rend="italic">De Samenstelling van den Romeinschen Senaat</hi>, no. 776, in typescript only). The chronological order of the highest offices is hard to ascertain. Firmicus Matemus cannot be right when saying that the urban prefecture (315â16) followed after the proconsulate of Africa, the earliest date of which is 324 (note Groag, p. 20, n. 1 "Ich wieder- hole, daÃ das Horoskop eines Astrologen kein staatsrechtlich maÃgebendes Dokument darstellt"). It should therefore be enough to accept Firmicus' statement that he held these offices without paying attention to the seeming chronological arrangement. Again, the <hi rend="italic">CIL</hi> X 5061 appears to enumerate the offices in groups without attempting to record their chronological order (Groag, p. 19, n. 1). The younger Rufinus could therefore very well have been <hi rend="italic">proconsul Achaiae</hi> after his tenure of the urban prefecture, and the present writer suggests that this actually was the case. (Groag, p. 19, n. 2, records a similar case as such an unusual occurrence in the <hi rend="italic">cursus honorum)</hi>.</p>

                  <p>Though accepting Groag's contention in this respect the author cannot agree with his reasons. He regards the Symmachus mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Codex Theodosianus</hi> II, 15,1 as holding the office of <hi rend="italic">vicarius</hi> (of the Moesian diocese). But above p. 40 the present writer has suggested that this constitution should be dated to July 25, 329 instead of 319. This, of course, has no further consequences in this context other than that we cannot automatically supply the title of <hi rend="italic">vicarius</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Codex Theodosianus</hi> II, 4, 1 of February 4, 318, also mentioning Symmachus as addressee. At that time he may well have been <hi rend="italic">proconsul Achaiae</hi>: whether he preceded or succeeded Rufinus the younger is impossible to determine. At any rate, it is very significant that two of the first officials charged with the administration of <hi rend="italic">Achaia</hi> were trusted followers of Constantine, and Rufinus, one of the two, was an extremely experienced administrator. A third <hi rend="italic">proconsul</hi> of the same category was Ianuarinus (Groag, pp. 21f.). The importance of the proconsular province of <hi rend="italic">Achaia</hi> is also reflected in the rank and repute accorded to its governors within the bureaucracy (Groag, p. 22).</p>

                  <p>The question of the burial date is more complex than what would appear at first sight. The absolute <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> is the turn of the year 320/321. Chronologically there is a puzzling gap of about two years between the latest Gallic coins and the three Nicomedian coins mentioned above. This indicates that Delos must have been more or less isolated after the arrival of the garrison. The Nicomedian coins show that the isolation was broken some time in 321, but nothing prevents us from assuming that the isolation continued until the time of the incident, which forced the individual in charge of the treasure to bury it. This may well have happened a couple of years after the 321 incident. It would therefore be more correct to give the burial date as 321â324 (inclusive). Our estimate of the burial date does not, however, affect the interpretation of the composition of the hoard.</p>

               <p>According to views expressed earlier by the present writer, the Sol coinage dominated the years 317â319 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, and 317â320 in Arelate (where it continued to be struck contemporarily with other types during the years 321â322 although at that time forming a decreasing proportion of the entire output of the mint).<ref target="#CH8-n290">

                  </ref> In Siscia and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> the Sol coinage was followed by the VICTORIAE LAETAE PRINC PERP issues in 317 and 318, respectively. No single coin of this type was included in the hoard. But the author's contention that the plain vota coins (DN CONSTANTINI MAX AVG-VOT XX, CAESARVM NOSTRORVM-VOT V etc.) at Arelate were struck in

consecutive issues during the years 317â321,<ref target="#CH8-n291">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> contemporarily with the Sol issues, receives no corroboration through the Delos hoard. On the contrary, although the Sol issues were by far the more numerous of the two, the natural selection of the current issues would have also included vota coins had both coinages been contemporary, and had the later Sol issue of the two represented in the hoard <graphic url="NNM146_104.jpg"/> really been struck as late as 319â320. Therefore, it seems necessary to squeeze the Gallic Sol issues within a shorter span of time, both in Arelate and in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, and assume that no major vota issues had been struck contemporarily (conceivably in 317â318; this would seem to support <persName>Mr. Carson's</persName> and <persName>Dr. Kent's</persName> view that the issues were "consecutive and exclusive, not contemporary."<ref target="#CH8-n292">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> Even so that does not mean that the Sol coinage ceased to be struck simultaneously in all the Western mints).<ref target="#CH8-n293">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> As regards the controversial date of the commemorative consecration coins, the composition of the hoard does not seem to speak against the date (317) suggested by the author.<ref target="#CH8-n294">

               <p>In the present hoard the coins struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> after New Year 317 were very scarce (9) and among them one was of the type REQVIES OPTIMOR MERIT- understandable with regard to the very big issues struck of these series. The corresponding REQVIES issues of the other
<pb n="91"/>
mints, Arelate, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, Siscia and Thessalonica were lacking. Again, had these coins been issued before 317, the lack of more coins from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> would have been very surprising indeed. At any rate, Kent's notion that these issues dated from the time immediately preceding Civil War II (recorded as belonging to the period 320â324, or 321â324), appears impossible.<ref target="#CH8-n295">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>Finally a few words remain to be said with regard to the extremely rich material from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. Svoronos did not attempt any chronological grouping, and the flan sizes recorded by him are suggestive but not conclusive (in some cases even controversial when e. g. all the coins mintmarked <graphic url="NNM146_105.jpg"/> with obverses of <persName>Licinius</persName> have the diameter 21 mm. whereas the corresponding coins with obverses of Constantine measure 22 mm.).</p>
               <p>Now, if we assume that all the coins preserved to our days are a fair representation of the coins struck in antiquity, and if we take a fair selection of collections and calculate that, despite the haphazard way in which many of these collections have been brought together, the various factors tending to give any one collection a particular character, are likely to counterbalance one another, something might be gained by comparing the coins of a certain hoard with the number of the corresponding coins found in the collections. Taking the coins of the Delos hoard struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and comparing them with the material collected by the present writer, we get the following result:<ref target="#CH8-n296">

               <p>Before an interpretation of these figures is attempted, the sequence of mintmarks should be discussed briefly. The first mark employed after the battle of the Milvian Bridge is RP using the long obverse legend IMP C CONSTANTIN VS PF AVG.<ref target="#CH8-n299">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> This mark was followed by
<pb n="93"/>
                  <graphic url="NNM146_107A.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM146_107B.jpg"/> using the same long obverse legend, and subsequently by a second RP series employing exclusively short obverse legends.<ref target="#CH8-n300">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The latter series, of reduced standards, is the last one in which coins of Daza appear. The order of the subsequent marks is more difficult to establish. The decrease in module is almost imperceptible,<ref target="#CH8-n301">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> but nevertheless the <graphic url="NNM146_107C.jpg"/> coins, which logically should form one group despite the varying serial marks, seem to be slightly larger and therefore earlier than the others. The correctness of this assertion is shown by the fact that the type MARTI CONSERVATORI was struck with the two former <graphic url="NNM146_107C.jpg"/> marks, and the striking of this type was discontinued well in advance of <hi rend="italic">Soli invicto comiti</hi> in other mints,<ref target="#CH8-n302">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> and, therefore, probably in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> as well. Assuming a development of mint- marks from plain marks to compound ones, we get the sequence <graphic url="NNM146_107D.jpg"/> after mid-313, the war against Daza. The crucial question is now the internal order of the remaining marks. The decrease in module suggests the <graphic url="NNM146_107E.jpg"/> mark to be the earliest (21 mm. according to Svoronos), the <graphic url="NNM146_107F.jpg"/> the last (19/21 mm.) with the <graphic url="NNM146_107G.jpg"/> as the second.<ref target="#CH8-n303">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="94"/>
               <p>We now return to the table above and to the percentages of the entire material constituted by the Delos coins. In actual fact we get a frequency curve, even if irregular on the right hand side of the diagram, representing the chronologically last mark of the series.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-4">
                  <graphic url="NNM146_108.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <pb n="95"/>
               <p>One important sequence of coins has, however, been omitted in these discussions, the third and obviously late RP series, the diameter of which was recorded as 19/21 mm. by Svoronos. The series comprises two types of <hi rend="italic">Soli invicto comiti</hi>, the ordinary "Sol standing left, holding globe," and the exceptional "Sol with captive." Both types were struck exclusively with obverses of Constantine.</p>
               <p>The difficulty in determining the position of the RP series in the sequence of mintmarks is the absence of other chronological criteria except for the measurements of Svoronos. Minor inaccuracies in Svoronos' lists would not have affected the treatment of the other series, all distinguished by clear serial marks. Now the type "Sol stg. l." is common to all three RP issues. Here all the coins of a diameter of 24 and 23/24 mm. have been referred to the earlier issues, whereas the coins of 19/21 mm. have been regarded as belonging to the late issue. However, in view of the difficulty of classifying coins on the evidence of measurement alone, Svoronos' figures should be treated with caution. On the other hand, the figures concerning the type <hi rend="italic">SPQR populi Romani</hi> suggest that the maximum error cannot be very significant.</p>
               <p>On the evidence of flan size the RP series should either precede or follow after the <graphic url="NNM146_109A.jpg"/> mark; the probability of this contention is strengthened by the common feature of the two series: the absence of Licinian obverses. Theoretically, however, with the frequency curve as a point of departure, the RP issue with its percentage 294 could fit in between the <graphic url="NNM146_109B.jpg"/> (266.67%) and the <graphic url="NNM146_109C.jpg"/> (398.64%). In practice it appears very unlikely that the three RF's should not have been consecutive.<ref target="#CH8-n304">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> On the declining (right) side of the curve the RP percentage<ref target="#CH8-n305">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> could possibly fit in between the peak and the
<pb n="96"/>
                  <graphic url="NNM146_110A.jpg"/>(253.85%). The curve, interpreted in terms of political history would in this case give us the unexpected picture of two conflicts with <persName>Licinius</persName> (an idea previously suggested by Seston, and later elaborated by Andreotti)<ref target="#CH8-n306">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> with a peaceful period marked by the <graphic url="NNM146_110B.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM146_110C.jpg"/> series in between. Two facts speak against this solution, the flan sizes and the short time shown to have passed e. g. by the bronze coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> between the rupture between Constantine and <persName>Licinius</persName> on the one hand and the official nomination of the Caesars at Serdica on the other. Thus it remains to place the RP series as immediately preceding the <graphic url="NNM146_110D.jpg"/> mark. This gives us the following curveâwith two peaks (cf. p. 97):</p>
               <p>How can this curve be explained ?</p>
               <p>One would, naturally, expect the issue current at the time when the hoard was collected to show the highest percentage. We have here two such instances. The bulk of the hoard would have been collected towards the close of the <graphic url="NNM146_110B.jpg"/> issue. Later an addition was made in the very beginning of the <graphic url="NNM146_110D.jpg"/> issue, comprising mostly late RP coins (possibly delivered directly from the mint as is suggested by the extraordinary high figure for the "Sol stg. l." type). Some earlier coins could very well have flowed into the treasure at the same time; in view of the few coins of the <graphic url="NNM146_110E.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM146_110F.jpg"/> (Sol with captive) series little importance need be attached to the variations of the percentage figures of these series. It is feasible that this part of the hoard never travelled very widely before it was shipped to Delos. It could have been shipped directly from Brundisium as cash for the garrison to be sent to Delos, possibly together with some troops. (With regard to the chronological discrepancy between this part of the hoard and the one shipped from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, one might even advocate that the consignment from <placeName>Rome-Brundisium</placeName> constituted the primary part, and the consignment from Gaul-<placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> the secondary part, the reinforcement).</p>

               </figure>
               <pb n="98"/>
               <p>We may add that some of the earlier coins possibly were incorporated with the treasure at a later stage in Arelate, or still later, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>. The possible additions made when the army contingent was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> would chronologically be slightly later than the expiry of the <graphic url="NNM146_112.jpg"/> issue in view of the natural time lag.</p>
               <p>With regard to all the facts known concerning the Delos hoard, it seems possible to explain its structure in detail. As to the general validity of the method employed, many objections can be raised. The basic material must be considerable and collected equally in the whole geographical area covered by the hoard.<ref target="#CH8-n307">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> It would obviously be wrong to compare an Eastern hoard with the coin material of the Western collections. Further, assuming that the hoard contained coins of the same weight and module, no unequivocal conclusions as to the chronological sequence of marks could be drawn. Considering the percentages only, the columns of the frequency curve could be grouped in many different ways. It must be assumed that a simple hoard, collected in the geographical area of the burial, would give us a straightforward curve similar to that on p. 94, if we exclude columns 7â9. In this case, however, it would be easy to switch nos. 4 and 6, but nos. 1(2) and 3 must be consecutive, no. 4 or 6 must precede no. 5.<ref target="#CH8-n308">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> In the case of a composite hoard such as the Delos one, only certain clues as to the internal order of marks can be found, but without other criteria it would be all too easy to draw a misleading curve with a single peak.</p>

                  <p>The composition of the hoard, clearly indicating the travels of the onetime treasure, excludes the possibility that the coins had been brought to Delos through ordinary channels of trade, or by an individual merchant. But even if that had been the case, the factual explanation of the hoard would scarcely differ from the one offered.</p>

                  <p>This particular type was chosen as a means of checking the result. As no coins of this type with the early long obverse legend are known, the type belongs to the later part of the issue; its percentage should therefore be slightly higher than the figure for the entire issue. The table proves this assumption to be correct. Moreover, this also seems to show that Svoronos' grouping of the less easily classified Sol coins of the mark RP on the whole is correct. If we include the coins of Daza in the figures above the percentages are slightly higher, as could be expected, 35.96 and 53.09, respectively.</p>

               <p>The foregoing notes on the Delos hoard have shown Greece and in particular the recreated province of Achaia, now raised to proconsular status, to have been of particular importance to Constantine, no doubt on strategic grounds. In Delos, Constantine got a bridgehead in the Aegaean archipelago, otherwise dominated by <persName>Licinius</persName>, and

it is permissible to assume that the burial of the hoard was caused by a Licinian raid on the island. In Civil War II the navies of the two adversaries played an important part; Athens and Piraeus seem to have been one of the foremost bases of Crispus, and <persName>Licinius'</persName> later concern with his possibilities to master the sea is mirrored in an Egyptian papyrus.<ref target="#CH8-n309">

               </p>
               <p>The extraordinary composition of the hoard, in view of the burial place, allowed us to trace in detail the history of its formation, and at the same time gave us some clues as to the date of certain of the coin series included in (or absent from) the hoard:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="(1)">The commemorative consecration coins should probably be accorded a slightly later date than the one previously suggested by the present writer. The year 320 should nevertheless be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi>.</item>
                  <item n="(2)">The dates of the Sol coinages of the Western mints should probably be readjusted. It is feasible that they, generally speaking, disappeared as early as 318â319.</item>
                  <item n="(3)">The earliest so called plain vota coins were scarcely contemporary with the Sol coinage. The hoard suggests that the bronze coinages were consecutive and exclusive rather than contemporary and over-lapping.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Finally an attempt was made to compare the numerical strength of the different issues of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> with the large material collected by the author, assuming this material to be a fair representation of the bronze coins in circulation at the time covered by the hoard. This method, if used with caution, and with due regard to the individual characteristics of each hoard, seems to give some clues as to the internal order of mintmarks.</p>

            </head>
            <p>This index of reverse legends does not aim at recording the gold coinage completely, but at illustrating the coins and numismatic landmarks discussed in the text (where e.g. submultiples have been included only when they have contributed something to the chronological discussion). Occasionally a cursory rev. description has been added to keep apart types of identical legg. struck with the same m. m. The point has been to illustrate the type, not to mention all possible obverse varieties. When gold was struck in several off., one off. only has been indicated. Collections referred to have been abbreviated as follows :</p>
