               </head>
               <p>Except for a short notice in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> (March, 1924, p. 301) the writer has not since had the leisure to discuss
                  two rather interesting hoards which he met with during his last sojourn in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> in the
                  winter of 1923-4. These two hoards, while not perhaps of any very great moment, none the less give us very welcome glimpses as to just what
                  constituted Egyptian currency at two periods of her history under the <persName>Ptolemies</persName>. Incidentally, they may also <pb n="2"/> serve to affirm or correct certain datings and attributions suggested by previous students of the somewhat intricate problems
                  presented by the various <persName>Ptolemaic</persName> coinages.</p>
               <p>For all information concerning the earliest of these hoards the writer is indebted to <persName>Dr. Eddé of Alexandria</persName>,
                  through whose hands these particular coins first passed. Such pieces as still remained in his possession in December, 1923, he kindly showed
                  the writer, informing him at the same time that certain specimens which had appeared in <persName>Ciani's</persName> Sale, held on
                  October 16th, 1923, at the Hotel Drouot in <placeName>Paris</placeName> (and which sale the writer had himself
                  chanced to attend), had also originally been in the find. The exact time and locality of the discovery <persName>Dr. Eddé</persName> did
                  not know or possibly, for obvious reasons, did not care to divulge. Briefly stated, the coins had been brought to him early in 1923 by some
                  peasants of the <placeName>Egyptian delta</placeName> who said they had found them while working their fields. More precise information <pb n="3"/> would not probably, in any case, add very greatly to the scientific value of our little hoard. According to <persName>Dr.
                     Eddé</persName> the "find", as sold to him by the peasants, consisted of the following twenty-one pieces:</p>

               <p>All of these coins, with the sole exception of No. 1 which had previously been disposed of, were actually seen and handled by the present
                  writer. Their uniform appearance and type of oxidization with sufficient clearness betokened their common origin from a single find. Nos. 2
                  and 3, though slightly corroded, were in good condition but showed signs of circulation. Nos. 4 to 21, though similarly attacked by corrosion
                  had obviously been in a brilliant state of preservation when their original owner had seen fit to bury them some twenty-one hundred odd years
                  ago.</p>
               <p>The Berenice coins Nos. 2 and 3, although very rare are, none the less, well known varieties<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> struck in the reign
                  of Ptolemy III Euergetes in honour of his beautiful and able wife Berenice, daughter of Magas of Cyrene. Nos. 7 to 20 inclusive, struck by
                  Ptolemy IV Philopator, are also well known, no less than eighteen specimens of this particular variety having been recorded by Svoronos.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> The same is true of No. 21, of similar <pb n="7"/> types but coined in the mint at Sidon.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> Nos. 4 to 6 inclusive, on the other hand, present a new variety of the Serapis and Isis type in that they have the monogram
                     <graphic url="NNM33_007.jpg"/> between the eagle's claws instead of the more usual ΔI. This may, perhaps, be looked upon as the first issue
                  of Ptolemy IV's reign as there is in existence a single specimen <ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> of the coinage with his mother's portrait
                  bearing the same monogram. This latter coin could not very well have been issued by Ptolemy IV himself as he had but just caused Berenice's
                  assassination when he came to the throne following his father's demise in 221 B. C. One might suppose, therefore, that the Berenice coin had
                  been struck under Euergetes, immediately preceding his death, and that its magistrate <graphic url="NNM33_007.jpg"/> continued to function for
                  a while under Ptolemy IV. It is also possible, though hardly probable, that Nos. 4 to 6 (together with the above-mentioned Berenice coin) were
                  not coined at Alexandria at all but belong to the Cyrenaic mint where we know<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> British Museum Catalogue <hi rend="italic">Cyrene,</hi> p. 83, Nos. 48-50, Pl. xxxi, 11-12, and Svoronos, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi> Nos. 1145-1152. that bronze
                  coins with a similar <pb n="8"/> monogram were being struck at this time. Be this as it may, the sudden appearance of certain Serapis and Isis
                  tetradrachms with the <graphic url="NNM33_007.jpg"/> monogram would confirm Svoronos' hesitating removal<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> to the
                  reign of Philopator of at least the bulk of the large series of bronze coins bearing this same monogram which he had at first assigned to the
                  reign of Euergetes (his Nos. 992–994). That the tetradrachms bearing the jugate busts of Serapis and Isis really belong to Philopator's reign
                  was first correctly recognized by Svoronos<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> and hardly requires further discussion. The special honours paid to
                  these divinities by Philopator<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> and the dedication of their joint temple at <persName>Alexandria</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> amply explain and date the sudden appearance of this interesting and novel type on the <persName>Ptolemaic</persName> coinage. That these particular coins should occur in a hoard mixed with Berenice issues still further supports Svoronos'
                  attribution.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the unearthing of two more specimens of the Berenice type <pb n="9"/> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> itself rather seems to do away, once and for all, with Svoronos' somewhat hazardous attribution of these coins to the mints
                  of Ephesus and Seleucia on the Orontes.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> Svoronos himself records<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> the finding of
                  two specimens in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>—the only definite provenience which he deigns to give us at all—but,
                  obviously to save his own view-point, states that these coins are especially frequently found in the coastal districts of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName> Minor.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> Unfortunately he neglects, or is unable, to furnish us with
                  any definite proof of his assertion. In contrast to this vagueness it is possible to show that at least nine of the known gold and silver
                  Berenice coins have turned up in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. One of the gold dodecadrachms and two of the silver
                  pentadrachms from the Dupré and Gréau collections are stated by <persName>C. W. Huber</persName> in his <hi rend="italic">"Zur alten
                     Numismatik Aegyptens"</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> to have been found while excavating the <placeName>Suez Canal</placeName>. A specimen of the gold
                  octodrachm in Huber's own collection is said by him<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> also to have been found in <pb n="10"/>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. Furthermore, according to Huber,<ref target="#CH1-n14a">14a</ref> Rev. Reichardt's
                  example of the gold pentadrachm was purchased by him in Cairo. Of the three gold Berenice coins in the present writer's collection two
                  (similar to Svoronos Nos. 973 and 982) were actually purchased in Cairo, and one of these was claimed by its former owner to have been found
                  at Ebtu in Upper <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> early in 1923. The third coin (= Svor. No. 972) there is good reason
                  to believe was found at Heliopolis near Cairo. Thus, together with the two Berenice silver coins in the present hoard, we possess more or less
                  authentic records of no less than nine of the known Berenice coins having turned up in the land of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>.
                  Certainly their style and fabric is not Asiatic but typically Egyptian.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Unfortunately our hoard brings us no new evidence by which we may explain the sudden and anomalous occurrence of coins of Attic weight in the
                  Egyptian series nearly a century after that system had been definitely abandoned by <persName>Ptolemy</persName>
                  <pb n="11"/> I Soter. Its reappearance may have been occasioned by certain exigencies of trade or of politics of which we know nothing or can
                  offer, at best, only vague surmises upon which to work. It is to be hoped that the future discovery or decipherment of contemporary papyri may
                  throw some welcome light upon so difficult and puzzling a question. Perhaps the wide-flung and successful campaigns of <persName>Ptolemy III</persName> through the very heart of the Seleucid empire (where the Attic weight system was at this time universally used), or the
                  bringing back to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> by victorious soldiery of plundered Seleucid treasures may have
                  thrown so much Attic silver and gold upon the Egyptian markets that there sprang up a demand for an intermediary coinage that would readily
                  exchange in terms of the two prevalent currencies—the Attic and the Egypto-Phoenician. Not only military successes but also an increased
                  foreign trade might have brought about a similar demand. At any rate, the Attic silver pentadrachm (such as No. 2) would represent the <pb n="12"/> equivalent of six <persName>Ptolemaic</persName> drachms (or one and a half of the usual current tetradrachms). The
                  two-and-a-half Attic drachm piece (such as No. 3) would equal three <persName>Ptolemaic</persName> drachms or three-fourths of a
                  tetradrachm. Similarly the gold Attic two-and-a-half drachm piece (Svor. No. 979) would represent the equivalent of three <persName>Ptolemaic</persName> gold drachms, the pentadrachm (Svor. Nos. 973, 978) of six <persName>Ptolemaic</persName> gold drachms, the
                  decadrachm (Svor. No. 972) of twelve <persName>Ptolemaic</persName> gold drachms or exactly one and a half of the ordinary gold Egyptian
                  Mυαɛîα, the commonest of Egyptian gold coins and at this time struck in both single and half pieces (Svor. Nos. 1117, 1118). This expedient of
                  issuing a coinage intermediary between the two dominant systems of the eastern Mediterranean was but ephemeral—as might have been expected.
                  With the commencement of Ptolemy IV Philopator's reign it was abandoned, never again to be revived.</p>
               <p>To return once more to our hoard, the <pb n="13"/> exact date of its burial can hardly be determined, any more than the causes which actually
                  led to its interment. The uniformly splendid preservation of Nos. 4 to 21, point, however, to the early years of Philopator's reign. For
                  several reasons, with which Regling apparently agrees,<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> Svoronos<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> has placed the
                  Serapis and Isis tetradrachms among the earliest issues of Philopator. Our hoard fully substantiates his views but offers nothing to fix the
                  date of burial closer than somewhere in the first quarter, certainly within the first half, of Philopator's reign.</p>

               </head>
               <p>This hoard, of small artistic but of considerable intrinsic and scientific value, would seem to have come to light some time in the first six
                  months of 1923. It was still, for the most part, in the hands of the well known dealer in antiquities, <persName>M. Maurice
                     Nahman</persName>, when the writer visited Cairo towards the end of that same year. <persName>M. Nahman</persName> very kindly granted
                  every facility for studying the coins and also furnished what little information is available concerning the discovery and disposal of the
                  hoard. It is said to have been found near Keneh in Upper <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> and was bought by <persName>M. Nahman</persName> just a month preceding the latter's departure for Europe in July, 1923. He took the opportunity of carrying a
                  selection of the coins with him for disposal in Paris where the present writer, a few months later, saw several specimens. Among others, one
                  Arsinoe gold octodrachm was <pb n="15"/> shown him by Messrs. Feuardent Frères, two or three more by <persName>M. Clément
                     Platt</persName>, while three octodrachms and ten silver tetradrachms appeared as Nos. 63-65, 73-82 in the auction sale held on October 16th,
                  1923, by Messrs. <persName>Ciani</persName> and Florange at the Hotel Drouot. When the writer arrived in <persName>Cairo</persName>,
                     <persName>M. Nahman</persName> still possessed in his trays some six or more of the gold octodrachms and about one hundred and sixty
                  silver tetradrachms. He also stated that, altogether, the hoard as offered to him had contained about forty-five gold coins (including two of
                  the rare Arsinoe gold tetradrachms) and over two hundred silver tetradrachms and also that, so far as he knew, he had been able to secure the
                  entire find.</p>
               <p>The coins were all without exception, both gold and silver, in the finest possible condition. The silver pieces were covered with a thin layer
                  of purplish grey oxide, while the gold pieces showed every evidence of having been buried with the silver, because their surfaces showed here
                  and there small patches of <pb n="16"/> the silver oxide where they had lain in contact with the disintegrating surfaces of the silver
                  tetradrachms. There can be no reasonable question but that all of these coins, both gold and silver, had really come from a single find as
                  stated by <persName>M. Nahman</persName>.</p>

                     <persName>Svoronos</persName>, were but sparsely represented in the <persName>Keneh Find</persName>. These particular varieties,
                  however, had been assigned by <persName>Poole</persName> (<persName>Brit. Mus. Cat.</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Ptolemies,</placeName>
                  </hi> pp. lxii, lxx-lxxi, Plate xxii, 1.) to a mint presumably transferred from <persName>Paphos to Alexandria</persName>. Entirely aside
                  from questions of style and fabric the present hoard refutes this opinion. For, if they had really been struck in <persName>Alexandria</persName>, it is almost certain that our hoard would have contained a larger number. <persName>Svoronos</persName> also does
                  not entirely accept<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> Poole's conclusion but continues to assign these coins to Paphos, as indicated by the
                  mint-mark IIA which they bear. On the other <pb n="21"/> hand it is equally certain that, at a slightly later date in the reign of <persName>Ptolemy VIII</persName>
                  <persName>Euergetes II</persName>, his <persName>Alexandrian</persName> issues really were marked with the letters IIA, as first
                  pointed out by <persName>Poole</persName>. These latter are only to be distinguished from the true issues of <persName>Paphos</persName> by their somewhat cruder but very individual style.</p>
               <p>While this is hardly the place to enter upon a detailed discussion of the many coinages of <persName>Philometor</persName> and <persName>Euergetes</persName> with a view not only to a definite separation of their respective issues but also to distinguish between the
                  IIA coins struck at <persName>Paphos</persName> and those issued from the <persName>Alexandrian</persName> mint, a few indications
                  of how this can be accomplished may not come amiss. We may start with the assumption, as proved by the very obvious evidence of fabric and
                  style, that the silver coins in our hoard represent the issues of two distinct mints. As they are all equally well preserved it is fairly
                  certain that they were more or less contemporaneous, and this rules out the possibility that they might have been struck <pb n="22"/> in one
                  mint. Again, it may reasonably be assumed that the coins whose numbers were greatest in our hoard ought to have come from the nearest mint,
                  namely <persName>Alexandria</persName>. And this assumption amounts to a certainty when we consider the fact that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> resembles a long narrow funnel or corridor, with <persName>Keneh</persName> situated well up the
                  narrowest part. The principal commercial door, commanding the mouth of the funnel, was <persName>Alexandria</persName>, the seat of a
                  very active mint. Naturally it would be her issues which would tend to predominate the further we proceeded along the neck of the funnel.
                  Therefore coins similar to <ref target="#fig-10">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate II</hi>, Nos. 4</ref>-<ref target="#fig-11">5</ref>, must certainly be <placeName>Egyptian in
                     origin</placeName>, and this fact has always been recognized by numismatists. The final six tetradrachms of our hoard (<ref target="#fig-13">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates III</hi>, 2</ref>-<ref target="#fig-16">5</ref>) then, must belong to another mint, and this can only be <persName>Paphos</persName> — indicated by the letters IIA and recognized as such by most numismatists except <persName>Poole</persName>. Obviously these coins are the direct successors in style and fabric of <persName>Svoronos'</persName>
                  <pb n="23"/> Plate xlix, Nos. 4-24, whose assignment to <persName>Paphos</persName> by the Greek scholar has never been questioned. In
                  their low relief and odd style these six tetradrachms are identical with the accepted Paphian issues but utterly unlike the Egyptian issues as
                  exemplified by <ref target="#fig-10">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate II</hi>, Nos. 4</ref>-<ref target="#fig-11">5</ref>. Therefore, they never could have been their successors. No,
                  the true successors of the prolific but unmarked <persName>Alexandrian</persName> issues of Philometor (here <ref target="#fig-10">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate II</hi>, 4</ref>-<ref target="#fig-11">5</ref>; Svoronos, Plate li, 1-5; Poole, Plate xxiv, 4-6) can only have
                  been coins such as Svoronos Plate lii, 2-4, bearing the dates of <persName>Euergetes KI and KH</persName>. In the stylistic peculiarities
                  of the Soter head, as well as of the eagle, these particular coins are intimately associated with the above-mentioned Egyptian issues. They
                  constitute the easy and obvious transition from them into the later certain <persName>Alexandrian</persName> issues of <persName>Euergetes</persName> such as <persName>Svoronos Plate xlix</persName>, No. 17, Plate lii, Nos. 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 24 and so on—i. e.,
                  coins with the now <persName>anomalous</persName> "mint-mark" IIA and the dates <pb n="24"/> running from Λ through NΔ. These latter
                  coins are certainly of <persName>Alexandrian</persName> origin. The present writer has secured innumerable specimens from strictly
                  Egyptian hoards, and in style and fabric they again merge directly into the issues of <persName>Ptolemies X Soter</persName> and <persName>XI Alexander</persName> (cf. <persName>Svoronos Plate lvii</persName>) which issues both <persName>Poole</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> and <persName>Svoronos</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref>. recognize as necessarily of Egyptian origin.</p>
               <p>Our hoard is furthermore instrumental in proving that <persName>Poole</persName>, following <persName>Reichardt,</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> is absolutely justified in assigning certain very rare coins (here <ref target="#fig-14">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate III</hi>, 3</ref>) to <persName>Ptolemy VII</persName>
                  <persName>Neos Eupator</persName>, the <persName>son of Ptolemy VI</persName>
                  <persName>Philometor</persName>, with whom he was associated in the kingdom the very year of the <persName>latter's</persName>
                  death. <persName>Svoronos</persName>, on the other hand, would see<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref>. in these coins an issue of <persName>Ptolemy VIII Euergetes</persName> struck in his 36th year (= 134 B. C.). He transposes the inscription in the field so as to read
                     LΛ<graphic url="NNM33_019.jpg"/> A KAI IIA and translates this : L (= year) Λ<graphic url="NNM33_019.jpg"/> (= 36 of <persName>Euergetes</persName>) A (= Aίγúπτου or Aλεξανδρεíας <pb n="25"/> KAI (= and) IIA (= άφουν ομίσμα With this conclusion Regling disagrees<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> absolutely and prefers the old explanation. Our hoard now comes to corroborate fully the majority opinion. In
                  the first place, this coin, if we were to follow <persName>Svoronos</persName>, would come some ten years later than the latest known
                  dated coin in the find, which is quite inadmissible. Secondly, these particular coins, as we have shown, were struck at <persName>Paphos</persName> and have nothing to do with <persName>Alexandria</persName> or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>—as <persName>Svoronos</persName> would have us believe from his rearrangement and translation of the inscription. Thirdly,
                  the date Λ<graphic url="NNM33_019.jpg"/>can only refer to Philometor, as the immediately following coin of our hoard (<ref target="#fig-15">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate III</hi>, 4</ref>) bears the date KE but is absolutely identical with it in the very individual style of its
                  obverse die. If further proof be needed, there happens to be in the writer's collection a coin similar to <ref target="#fig-13">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate III</hi>, 2</ref> (and therefore certainly of <persName>Ptolemy VI</persName> Philometor) but struck from
                  the <hi rend="italic">same obverse die</hi> as <pb n="26"/>
                  <ref target="#fig-14">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate III</hi>, 3</ref>. The latter coin must, therefore, belong to Philometor and not to a date ten years after his
                  death. Now we know from <persName>Porphyrius</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> that the last year of Philometor was his 36th Λ(<graphic url="NNM33_019.jpg"/>), which was also the 25th (KE)
                  year of <persName>Euergetes</persName> in his second reign at <persName>Alexandria</persName>. The association in our little hoard
                  of the three coins <ref target="#fig-13">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate III</hi>, 2</ref>-<ref target="#fig-15">4</ref>, all so absolutely identical in style and fabric, is quite
                  sufficient to refute the opinion of <persName>Svoronos</persName>.</p>
               <p>While it has long been believed that the <persName>Arsinoe gold octodrachms</persName> and tetradrachms of increasingly mediocre style,
                  and bearing the letter K behind the head (here <ref target="#fig-7">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate II</hi>, 1</ref>-<ref target="#fig-9">3</ref>, also <persName>Ciani's</persName> sale Plate iii, Nos.
                  63-65), were more or less contemporaneous with the silver tetradrachms such as <ref target="#fig-10">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate II</hi>, 4</ref>-<ref target="#fig-11">5</ref>, and that all of these coins belonged somewhere in the second
                  century B. C.,<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> no definite proof of this has so far been presented. The Keneh hoard fortunately steps in to
                  fill this gap in the most definite fashion. There can now be no doubt <pb n="27"/> but that these particular gold octodrachms and tetradrachms
                  and silver tetradrachms (together with their accompanying didrachms not represented in our hoard) not only belong together but that they must,
                  for the most part, be assigned to the reign of <persName>Ptolemy VI Philometor</persName>. A few may have been struck after <persName>Ptolemy VIII Euergetes</persName> had finally returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> in 147-6 B. C.,
                  on the death of his elder brother. For the earliest dated coin of his which we have from the <persName>Alexandria</persName> mint was not
                  struck until 144-3 B. C. (i. e., year KI = <persName>Svoronos</persName>, Plate lii, No. 2). The two intervening years, therefore, may
                  well have seen the continuation of the undated coinage inaugurated by Philometor. In assigning these coins to Philometor it must always be
                  remembered that for a goodly portion of his reign he was actually ruling conjointly with his brother <persName>Euergetes</persName>, but
                  the coinage was doubtless considered as being issued in the name of the senior brother. It should also be stated that all of the one hundred
                  and fifty-five <pb n="28"/> tetradrachms from our hoard actually seen in <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, as well as those sold in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, were more or less identical with the two here illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate
                     II</hi>. The hoard apparently contained none of the somewhat similar pieces, but of flatter relief and smaller design, such as are pictured
                  by <persName>Svoronos Plate xl</persName>, Nos. 2-6, and <persName>Poole</persName>, Plate xxiv, No. 7. With the inauguration of a
                  dated coinage at <persName>Alexandria</persName> under <persName>Euergetes</persName> in 144-3 B. C. the series of undated
                  tetradrachms probably came to an end. It may not have been so with the gold octodrachms bearing the old Arsinoe types. Exceptionally crude
                  pieces, such as <persName>Svoronos Plate lviii</persName>, No. 3, do not seem to have been present in the <persName>Keneh
                     Find</persName> and so may have been issued at a later date.</p>
               <p>The silver coins in the <persName>Keneh Hoard</persName> were practically all in the same splendid state of preservation, though,
                  naturally, there was considerable variation in the amount of corrosion exhibited by the various specimens. The gold coins, too, showed little
                  or no wear, with the exception <pb n="29"/> of those few of somewhat better style (such as <ref target="#fig-12">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate III</hi>, 1</ref>) which exhibited slight signs of circulation as compared with those of a little cruder style
                  (such as <persName>Ciani's</persName> Sale, Plate iii, Nos. 63-5) which were in an absolutely sharp and uncirculated condition. It is
                  remarkable that the only known dated coins in our find should all cover the short period of two years, i. e., year Λ<graphic url="NNM33_019.jpg"/> (36) of Philometor (= 146-5 B. C.); year Λ<graphic url="NNM33_019.jpg"/> (36) of Philometer with A (1) of Eupator
                  (also = 146-5 B. C.); and years KE (25) and K<graphic url="NNM33_019.jpg"/> (26) of <persName>Euergetes</persName> (= 145 and 145-4 B.
                  C.). And this although the dated <persName>Cypriote</persName> issues, both before and after these particular years, are quite common!
                  There must be some significance in so curious a fact and it suggests that the hoard was buried not very much after the year 144 B. C. This is
                  further corroborated by the apparent total absence of any of the dated <persName>Alexandrian</persName> issues of <persName>Euergetes</persName> which first commenced to appear in his 27th year, or in 144-3 B. C. If the hoard had <pb n="30"/> been buried much later
                  than this date they ought to have been represented in the find, considering the comparatively large number of coins which it actually
                  contained.</p>
               <p>As the <persName>Keneh</persName> hoard was thus apparently buried within the first few years of <persName>Euergetes'</persName>
                  return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> its interment may not have been unconnected with the somewhat disturbed
                  condition of the country due to the repressive measures at once adopted by the new king. He was obviously most unpopular with certain powerful
                  factions, especially the Greek and the Jewish, who had particularly favoured the well-beloved Philometor. On his death they had declared for
                  his widow and youthful <persName>son Ptolemy Neos Eupator</persName> as against <persName>Euergetes'</persName> claim to the throne.
                  It was only with an army at his back that <persName>Euergetes</persName> made good his claim, and being of an energetic and ruthless
                  nature proceeded at once to make certain of his position by all means in his power, including assassination, massacre and wholesale
                  banishment. <pb n="31"/> Such drastic measures, ruthlessly carried out in the first years<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> of his reign, must
                  have brought fear and consternation to the wealthier and more influential people of the country, especially to those at all intimately
                  associated with the preceding reign or devoted to its memory. In such times of imminent danger to property and person many a family treasure
                  would assuredly find its way into the ground, there to await—if disaster befell—the lucky finder of later ages. That the Keneh Hoard
                  represents one of these hastily buried fortunes may well be. The burial date would support the suggestion—but absolute certainty can hardly be
                  expected in such a case.</p>

                  literally hundreds of others from Egyptian "finds".</p>

               <p>Compare them, for instance, with the well known gold octodrachms bearing the radiate bust of Euergetes (Svor., No. 1117) as against the one
                  gold octodrachm of Berenice which was certainly struck in Ephesus (Svor., Nos. 899 and 900; Brit. Museum Catalogue, Plate xiii, 2). The former

               <p>Poole, in the British Museum Catalogue, assigned the gold to Ptolemy VIII or later (<hi rend="italic">introd.,</hi> p. xli), the silver solely
                  to Ptolemy VIII (<hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> p. lxxiv). Svoronos gives (<hi rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi> Vol. I, pp. <hi rend="italic">τξδ'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">νs'</hi>) some of the gold to <persName>Ptolemy VI</persName> and some to <persName>Ptolemy
                     VIII</persName>, <pb n="34"/> while the silver he assigns (<hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. <hi rend="italic">τ'7ξ' - τ'7ή</hi>) <persName>Ptolemies VI and VIII</persName>. Regling clearly sees that their style points rather to Ptolemy VI (<hi rend="italic">Zeitschr.
                     f. Num.,</hi> Vol. XXV, p. 382). It was undoubtedly due to insufficient data that Poole was led to question (<hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>
                  p. lxxiii) the Egyptian origin of these tetradrachms. In additon to the present hoard the writer, in the course of three previous visits to
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, saw many of these particular coins which had come from hoards undoubtedly
                  unearthed in that country. They seem to be particularly common on the Egyptian coin market.</p>
