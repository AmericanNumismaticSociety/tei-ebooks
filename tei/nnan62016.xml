            <p>The choice of types for ancient coins was partly an aesthetic matter, a problem of choosing a design which would adequately fill a round space; it was also partly a matter of employing appropriate symbolism. The symbol might have a limited appropriateness, like the tortoise of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, or a universal one, like the head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> which appears at many places and at many times. Sometimes the symbol disappeared with the passing of its particular occasion; sometimes, on the other hand, it continues to appeal to die-sinkers and those who control them so that it long outlasts its original appearance and comes to have connotations quite foreign to its first meaning. Such a symbol is that of victory, whose life as a coin type stretches from the end of the sixth century before Christ to the sixth century after Christ, and beginning as the Greek Nike becomes, at the end, a Christian angel.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Nike, who never appears in the Homeric epic, and is mentioned for the first time by Hesiod, owes the significance which she acquired, especially in <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> and Roman times, neither to cult mythology nor to literature, but to formative art. In Hesiod (Theogony pp. 383f.) Nike is identified as the daughter of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Pallas</ref>, the <persName>Titan</persName>, and <placeName>Styx</placeName>, being a sister of <persName>Zelos</persName>, <persName>Kratos</persName> and <persName>Bia</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> She was not considered anthropomorphic as were the other Olympian deities nor were any myths invented about her. Consequently her real meaning is known to us rather from vases and coins than from literature. Her function might be either warlike or peaceful; the verb νικάω and the substantive νίκη can be used either for victory in war or in any form of rivalry.<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> From the artistic representations it becomes clear that she is not originally the granter of victory, but the bearer of it. She is not depicted in a fighting pose but she can be companion or attribute of all gods granting victory who were identified, as it were, with war. It is only natural, then, that Nike would be associated with those gods possessing special or highest prowess in war, and so she was particularly closely bound to <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> and <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>. <persName>Pheidias</persName> emphasized her connection with the highest gods by placing Nike on the hand of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> in the great cult statue at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>. Her appearance in the vase painting depicting the birth of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> from the head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> is sufficient illustration of the constant and close association of Nike with <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>.<ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> She could, however, be connected with other victory-granting gods, as, for example, <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q40730">Demeter</ref>,<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
               <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q618515">Aphrodite</ref>
               <pb n="3"/>
Urania as mistress of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pontus">Pontus</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> or <persName>Aphrodite Stratonikos</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> But though originally a mere symbol of victory with no mythological existence, she later becomes an individual divinity with her own attributes, such as the wreath and palm. She is winged, as are <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41484">Hermes</ref> and <persName>Iris</persName>, the messengers of the gods, so that the divine orders may be carried with the swiftness of the wind.</p>
            <p>The first appearance of Nike as a coin type (<ref target="#fig-3">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 1</ref>) is at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> about 510 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.,<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> where she is certainly intended to symbolize victory in the games.<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> The figure is shown with wings spread, appearing to run to the left, in conformity with a very early convention for depicting flight.<ref target="#CH1-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref> "The chiton," says <persName>Seltman</persName>, "hangs in a semi-circle between the feet suggesting the support a statue of this type would require."<ref target="#CH1-n10">
                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref>
               <pb n="4"/>
In her outstretched hand is the wreath with which the victor is to be crowned. Her wings, except that they are more pointed, are just like those of the eagle on the obverse, with long primaries, short secondaries, and coverts expressed by dots, making a three-fold division. Her drapery is drawn with great delicacy. Altogether, she is a very attractive figure, and a very satisfactory design, "a scheme" as Miss <persName>Richter</persName> puts it, which is "a convention, highly decorative, far from naturalistic, but admirably serving its purpose." The figure is sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, but the pose remains essentially the same throughout the early period.</p>
            <p>An interesting parallel to this figure is the one on an electrum stater and hecta of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-4">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 2</ref>) of a winged female figure running left with head turned back. In her right hand is the tunny fish which is the regular sign of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, but she has no attributes by which she may be identified. Of this type <persName>William Greenwell</persName> says<ref target="#CH1-n11">
                  <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
               </ref> "An archaic coin, and possibly not later than <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 500. The figure can scarcely represent Nike, for the action is inconsistent with such an attribution." He calls attention to related subjects on vases and to a winged female figure on coins attributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mallus">Mallus</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cilicia">Cilicia</placeName>. <persName>Ernest Babelon</persName> does not hesitate to call it <hi rend="bold">

and the statuette in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. However just his argument may be, the similarity of the positions at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mallus">Mallus</placeName> is certainly striking, and suggests that the former, as well as the latter, has been much more affected by oriental influence than the art of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>. It is notoriously difficult to date the Cyzicene electrum. The last student of the series, <persName>Kurt Regling</persName>, believes that the group to which our type belongs falls between 550 and 480,<ref target="#CH1-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref> and there seems to be no attempt at more accurate dating than that of <persName>Greenwood</persName>. It is possible, therefore, that the Cyzicene piece is earlier than the first Nike of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>. Yet it is hardly to be regarded as the ancestor of the Olympian series. Aside from the difference of position, the type of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, whatever its inspiration, is a casual inclusion in a rich and diverse series, giving no information as to the nature of the goddess and suggesting no such relation with the town as that between Nike and the games.</p>
            <p>The greater knowledge of anatomy of the 5th century led to a more gracious drawing of the figure at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-6">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 4</ref>). The gain in realism, however, meant an abandonment of the old convention expressing flight. This younger Nike may be understood as just alighting but hardly as speeding through the air. This was a matter of no great concern to the artist, however, for the symbol was now so well established that variation of pose could not obscure its meaning. The goddess therefore appears standing at rest (<ref target="#fig-7">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 5</ref>), seated holding out the victor's wreath (<ref target="#fig-8">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 6</ref>), seated with her head on her hand (<ref target="#fig-9">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 7</ref>) and seated holding a palm branch (<ref target="#fig-10">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 8</ref>), this being "the most famous, the last and technically the most perfect of the Nikes of this mint." It was struck in a period which <persName>Seltman</persName> dates, on reasonable grounds, as 431–421 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. The previous reverse (<ref target="#fig-9">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 7</ref>) belonging to the series dated 452–432 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>., is perhaps the most interesting type, and merits a detailed description. Nike, wearing a long chiton and peplos wrapped
<pb n="6"/>
around her from waist to feet is seated right on a square block. Her hair is rolled, her head, facing slightly, is bent downward and she supports it with her left hand, her elbow resting on her knee. In her right hand, hanging down, she holds two short laurel twigs. As <persName>Seltman</persName> suggests, her attitude, were it not incompatible with the nature of the Olympian coinage, might be described as mourning. Since there is a growing tendency toward naturalistic treatment, it is a very attractive idea to suppose that the artist is here indicating the general feeling of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war. This is the extreme of variation, and it must be confessed that the figure, charming as it is, would hardly be recognized as Nike except for the connection with her more explicit predecessors. And, indeed, all the poses except the first, with some archaizing imitations of it, have weakened the significance of the wings. These become purely decorative and not functional at all. Spread wings on an emissary descending from heaven is a pretty fancy; spread wings on a maiden sitting on a stone may be still a pretty pattern, but it is a physiological absurdity. The fact that Nike is so depicted shows what great freedom the die-sinker had within his general subject, and how much might be sacrificed to considerations of design.</p>
            <p>The significance of the general subject, however, is kept steadily in mind, and it is interesting as relating not to the issuing authority of the coin, but to its recipient. Victory is granted not by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>, but by <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref>, and victory is bestowed not on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> but on the individual contestants who come to the games. The other associated types—<ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> and <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q38012">Hera</ref>, the thunderbolt and the eagle—express the august powers that ruled over the holy place, but Nike is a hope and a challenge to every aspirant who made his way to the great panhellenic testing grounds.</p>
            <p>Perhaps because she was so satisfactory a choice for this place, Nike was not used as a type elsewhere in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> pro-
<pb n="7"/>
per until much later. Instead, she appears in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName> with a related though not identical meaning. The connection of Sicilians with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> is well known. Indeed, the suggestion has been made that the development of the games from a regional to a panhellenic celebration was largely due to them.<ref target="#CH1-n16">
                  <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
               </ref> A victor from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> is recorded as early as the middle of the 7th century. The lords of that great city had shown their enthusiasm for the races by selecting a chariot as the type of their tetradrachms. At about the time of the first appearance of Nike at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> she was introduced on the Syracusan coins at the top, crowning either the charioteer (<ref target="#fig-11">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 1</ref>) or the horses (<ref target="#fig-12">

                  <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
               </ref> The connection with the Olympian games is thus clearly expressed. But Nike is modified both in appearance and in meaning. In place of the running figure is one nearly horizontal whose wings are either above and below (<ref target="#fig-11">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 1</ref>) or both above (<ref target="#fig-12">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 2</ref>). On some dies, to be sure, the figure is nearly upright (<ref target="#fig-13">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 3</ref>) and is more like that of the alighting Nike of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-6">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 4</ref>). The other pose, however, is much commoner. This has some advantages for the design as a whole, but the goddess herself is nothing like so satisfactory. It was not until the last third of the 5th century that the remarkable
<pb n="8"/>
artists who signed their dies converted the figure, by careful modelling and skillful use of drapery, into a satisfactory representation of flight (<ref target="#fig-23">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 6</ref>).</p>
            <p>In spite of the considerable freedom with which the type was developed, the early symbolism is clear and consistent. Nike is not now, as at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>, prepared to offer her wreath to the victor, whoever he may be. She is shown in the act of celebrating a particular triumph: that of the chariot from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. Her meaning is thereby made more pointed and more restricted. We need not assume that the coins were struck to celebrate the first Syracusan victory or any special subsequent one. It is sufficient that <hi rend="italic">some</hi> Syracusan chariot should have won before the Sicilian lords presumed to borrow the Olympian type to be an adjunct of their own.</p>
            <p>The example of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> was very promptly followed by two of her neighbors, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_leontini">Leontini</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gela">Gela</placeName> who copy her type with no significant changes. A more interesting case is that of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rhegium">Rhegium</placeName> and Messana. In the early 5th century they were both in the power of the tyrant <persName corresp="#nomisma_anaxilas_priene">Anaxilas</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n18">
                  <hi rend="sup">18</hi>
               </ref> We know that it was he who struck in both cities coins showing a hare and a biga of mules, for a fragment of <persName>Aristotle</persName>, preserved in the lexicon of Pollux (V, 75) tells us that <persName corresp="#nomisma_anaxilas_priene">Anaxilas</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rhegium">Rhegium</placeName> introduced hares into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName> for the first time, and having won the race for mule cars at the Olympic games, put both hare and mule car on the coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rhegium">Rhegium</placeName>. This victory <persName>Dunbabin</persName> would date in 480, which is suitable stylistically. Messana used exactly the same types as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rhegium">Rhegium</placeName>, but the Sicilian city presently added a Nike, after the Syracusan fashion (<ref target="#fig-14">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 4</ref>) which the Italian city never did (<ref target="#fig-15">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 5</ref>).</p>
            <p>These examples all show the same origin and meaning, but a very different Nike appears on an early coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_agrigentum">Acragas</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-16">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 6</ref>). Here the ungainly attitude is not unlike that on the Syracusan coins and is more likely to have been de-
<pb n="9"/>
from them than from those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>. But the significance is like neither. This Nike has no apparent connection with the games at all, for she is now used as an adjunct not to a victorious chariot, but to the crab which is the normal type of the city.<ref target="#CH1-n19">
                  <hi rend="sup">19</hi>
               </ref> Of course it is not impossible that there should have been a victory in the games here celebrated in this inappropriate fashion, but the effect certainly is to give to Nike a more generalized meaning and to seem for the first time to attach her, not to a particular event, but to a particular city. This is a very different thing from her appearance at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> where, as has already been pointed out, she belongs not to the place but to the contests.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName> also presents the goddess under an unprecedented aspect. The obverse type is a man-headed bull, representing the river-god Amenanos, beneath him a fish, above, a heron or a water-plant, both signifying the marshes through which the stream makes its way. The earliest reverse is an original and unsuccessful attempt to depict flight (<ref target="#fig-17">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 7</ref>). The winged figure faces to the right, her wings filling the space behind her, her left arm held stiffly before her. The lower right is filled by a horizontal branch which she holds in her right hand and by a big shell. The inscription runs around the right edge. This strange attitude is varied on a litra of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName>, 495–484 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. where the goddess is shown to the left or right, her wings spread before her and behind, with a swan in front of her (<ref target="#fig-18">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 1</ref>). She seems to bear neither wreath nor palm, though the small scale makes it difficult to be sure. A later and softened version is found on a drachm of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName> whose obverse is a poor copy of <persName>Cimon</persName>'s facing head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q643456">Arethusa</ref>; Nike has here a fillet and caduceus and there is no object in the field before her (<ref target="#fig-19">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 2</ref>).</p>
            <pb n="10"/>
            <p>One obverse die of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName> stater is used both with the flying Nike and with her successor, a Nike striding to the left carrying a fillet<ref target="#CH1-n20">
                  <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
               </ref> (<ref target="#fig-20">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 3</ref>) which continues to be the type until 476 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. when Hiero of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> drove the inhabitants out, changed the town's name to Aetna and introduced new types. This goddess may have been derived from the running figure of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>, though her appearance is quite different and no illusion of flight is created. Instead she seems to be hastening to meet the victor. But she and the flying Nikes of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName> would seem to be connected only with victors from their particular towns, though they are not confined, as at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, to the celebration of a single event, even if it were the most splendid. We must suppose that their fillets and palms are offered to any son of the city who triumphed. Are they then the impartial, oecumenical goddess of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>, or have they a stricter connection each with her own town? The development of the obverse type of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName> is clear evidence that the latter is true. For above the back of the bull sometimes appears a little Nike, like that over the Syracusan chariot, flying to crown his head with a wreath (<ref target="#fig-21">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 4</ref>). Here is a conception much like that of the Nike under the crab of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_agrigentum">Acragas</placeName>, but more specific. Coupled with the goddess on the reverse, it announces and foretells that the favor of Nike belongs to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName> by right. She has become a goddess whose association with a particular place is permanent, and we may suppose that the same is true of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Still another important innovation occurs at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName>. The place of Nike crowning the man-headed bull is sometimes taken by <persName>Silenus</persName>, in a kneeling attitude, but not touching the bull's back, so that he must be considered, like her, an immortal power moving through the air. Now the importance of <persName>Silenus</persName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName> is made sufficiently clear by the use of his head as obverse type on the succeeding coins of
<pb n="11"/>
Aetna. Another divinity, then, may perform the function of Nike and crown the victor. It is not now nearly so clear that Nike and <persName>Silenus</persName> are merely emissaries of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref>. It looks very much as though they were bestowing victory as well as marking it. The conception of Nike has grown more general and less precise.</p>
            <p>As the 5th century advanced, the coinage of Sicily became more luxuriant, and Nike, like all other types, was affected by the progress of artistic imagination. There are no better known and no more brilliant specimens of early and late 5th century art at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> than the Demareteion of 479 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. (<ref target="#fig-22">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 5</ref>), and the series of decadrachms initiated to commemorate the defeat of the Athenians in 413 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. (<ref target="#fig-23">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 6</ref>). Without embarking on the barren discussion of comparative merits, we may recognize that the later attention to detail has increased the interest of the figure of Nike, which is now drawn with great care. It does not follow, however, that her significance has increased. Indeed the symbolism has become so conventionalized as to lose contact with its origin. While Nike had disappeared from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>n coins toward the end of the first phase of the Peloponnesian war in 421 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>., she continued to accompany the chariots of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. The tendency to maintain a successful and familiar type, which is an important element in numismatic history, carried this one through a period when Sicilian participation in the games in the Peloponnese is unlikely, and left it available to serve for the games which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> herself organized. There is no point which marks the end of the connection with the Olympian games, so conspicuous in 510 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. Nike simply acquired, by constant repetition, a more general function which makes her association with the new games as appropriate as her connection with the old.</p>
            <p>In the period of spectacular experimentation which extended from the late 5th century through the first half of
<pb n="12"/>
the 4th the use of Nike as a subsidiary to the type is widespread. The victory-crowned chariot (in which galloping horses replace the earlier walking ones) is confined to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName>; on that island it is found on coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_agrigentum">Acragas</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cephaloedium">Cephaloedium</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gela">Gela</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_himera">Himera</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_leontini">Leontini</placeName> (but not after 466), <placeName corresp="#nomisma_zancle">Messina</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_panormus">Panormus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_selinus_sicily">Selinus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thermae_himerenses">Thermae Himerensis</placeName> (Naville Catalogue X [1925] no. 214). These exhibit many variations: the chariot is either to the right or to the left, Nike is either to the right or to the left, sometimes she crowns the horses and sometimes the charioteer, sometimes she bears a complete wreath and sometimes a fillet, sometimes she is not crowning the charioteer but handing the wreath to him, on one coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_messana">Messana</placeName> she is about to put the fillet on his head with one hand while she offers a wreath to him with the other (<ref target="#fig-24">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 1</ref>). A more extreme variation was invented by the artist <persName>Cimon</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. The goddess appears standing on the heads of the two near horses on the reverse of a piece with a celebrated facing head for obverse, and an equally unlikely pose shows her standing on the reins of the mule car at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_messana">Messana</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-25">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 2</ref>).</p>
            <p>These are differences of varying degrees of artistic effectiveness which do not modify the earlier idea of Nike. Real modifications do appear, however. At <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> the artist <persName>Evainetos</persName> produced a die with an astonishing display of self-assurance, for the Nike flying over the chariot holds now not wreath or fillet, but a tablet bearing the name of <persName>Evainetos</persName> himself! (<ref target="#fig-26">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 3</ref>). Obviously her original function has been entirely forgotten. A less startling use of the tablet is found at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_agrigentum">Acragas</placeName>, where it appears above the chariot with the city's name upon it; in this case Nike herself is the charioteer. Nike drives the chariot again at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gela">Gela</placeName> when her place above the horses is taken by an eagle, that equivalent symbol of victory (<ref target="#fig-27">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 4</ref>). Finally, at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName>, Nike is again crowning the charioteer, but this is now no mortal driver, but <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> herself (<ref target="#fig-28">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 5</ref>). In the ill-defined
<pb n="13"/>
imagination of the artist the bearer of victory is returning it to its divine source.</p>
            <p>The parallel conception of Nike as attached to the community rather than to an event, already noticed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName>, has its influence outside of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName>. The man-headed bull which is the standard type of <placeName>Naples</placeName> is crowned by Nike in apparent imitation of the Sicilian ones though there is a century between them (<ref target="#fig-29">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 6</ref>). On a 4th century coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_lucaniae">Heraclea</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lucania">Lucania</placeName> Nike is shown crowning the hero <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> (<ref target="#fig-30">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 7</ref>) and on one of about the same time from Velia a little Nike flies over the city's lion (<ref target="#fig-31">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 8</ref>). But these two cases are somewhat different from the earlier ones. Nike is only one of a number of symbols used to accompany the main type, and though she is related to it in a way that the vase or owl or bucranium of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_lucaniae">Heraclea</placeName>, the caduceus or trident or wheat-ear of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_velia">Velia</placeName> are not, it is by no means impossible that she is merely the mint magistrate's sign, like them, and therefore no organic part of the type. That she does occur as a magistrate's symbol on later coins is, of course, well known and is strikingly illustrated by gold of <persName>Philip II</persName> of Macedon where the little goddess is placed in a preposterous context, for she is about to be trampled by the galloping horses (<ref target="#fig-32">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 1</ref>).</p>
            <p>At Carthage, on the other hand, the connection is closer. The standard reverse of Carthage is a horse, or the head or forepart of a horse, generally combined with a palm tree. Nike is frequently seen flying above the horse, or its forepart, crowning it with a fillet (<ref target="#fig-33">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 2</ref>, <ref target="#fig-34">3</ref>) or in front of and crowning a standing horse (<ref target="#fig-35">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 4</ref>). This, like the series of <placeName>Naples</placeName>, is a continuation of the doctrine of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName> that victory is an essential possession of the city.</p>
            <p>We must now discuss a very interesting but abnormal series: that of the didrachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, which is not connected with the Nikes of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName> and is affected by the later Olympian types only.

This has, of course, roused recollections of Nike Ápteros at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, and encouraged the theory of an ancient cult of wingless victory at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n22">
                  <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
               </ref> This is not provable and not particularly likely, but the question has little importance to us, for after this first experiment the artists replaced the figure with a maiden with wings, (<ref target="#fig-37">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 6</ref>-<ref target="#fig-39">8</ref>). Three other pieces of the first period, which lasted until about 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>., are in three different attitudes: the first holds a wreath and branch, the second a branch in both hands (<ref target="#fig-37">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 6</ref>), the third a wreath alone, one hand being concealed in the folds of her chiton. These are all suitable enough for Nike, as is the single branch in the hand of their wingless elder sister, and <persName>Regling</persName> is doubtless right in concluding that the three unnamed figures are also representations of the same divinity. But there is no suggestion as to how she is to exercise her function. There are no games here, still less any prospect of war at this period. The recorded history of the town is bare enough<ref target="#CH1-n23">
                  <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
               </ref> and would give us no reason to suspect the brilliance to which the coins testify. There may well have been some local meaning which now eludes us but the prima facie significance of the obverse type is to attribute victory in general to the nymph <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName> whose portrait appears on the obverse. This close connection of Nike with the city herself is emphasized on the succeeding issues which fill the century down to the sacking of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName>
               <pb n="15"/>
by the Bruttii in 356 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. With one exception the figures retain their wings and often their wreaths, but they usually hold a caduceus and their poses hardly suggest the bearer of victory. One variety, with wings spread on both sides (<ref target="#fig-38">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 7</ref>), does indeed recall the Olympian Nike seated on a pedestal (<ref target="#fig-8">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 6</ref>), but others, whether standing, or seated on an overturned jar, as they frequently are (<ref target="#fig-39">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 8</ref>), have a charming playfulness about them quite out of keeping with the normal conception of Victory. Many of the dies show (as does <ref target="#fig-39">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 8</ref>) a little bird perched on the maiden's hand in a manner which suggests her humanity rather than her divinity—or at least a diversion of her divinity bey ond that of even the latest Olympian Nike. <persName>Regling</persName>'s opinion is that we have here a conflation of divine persons, Nike and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName>, and this is strongly supported by one coin on which the seated figure is wingless while a little Nike flies up behind her to crown her (<ref target="#fig-40">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 9</ref>). This is the idea already familiar to us from the crowned bulls of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_catana">Catana</placeName> and <placeName>Naples</placeName>. The types of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName> have only carried it one step farther and not merely claimed a special relation between Nike and their city but actually identified the two.</p>
            <p>The issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName> are perhaps the clearest demonstration of the independence of the artist through the 5th and 4th centuries. We need not suppose that it was the die-sinkers themselves who invented the device of presenting their city as the goddess of victory herself but, the device once established, they clearly had great latitude in modifying it, and they were certainly virtuosi who deserved such confidence.<ref target="#CH1-n24">
                  <hi rend="sup">24</hi>
               </ref> That they were not impervious to the influence of other mints is proven by comparison of <ref target="#fig-8">

period (<ref target="#fig-37">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 6</ref>), and one can hardly doubt that the Olympian coin served as a model for that from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName>. But it is a model not to be slavishly followed, and it is an isolated instance. Indeed this freedom of the artist is the most important characteristic of the appearance of Nike in the period with which we have been dealing. He was quite competent to adapt his material to his design, and if he sometimes copied, as the early chariots of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gela">Gela</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_leontini">Leontini</placeName> copied those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, it was from choice and neither from poverty of imagination nor compulsion from higher authority.</p>
            <p>Of course there were forms of Nike other than those popular with the die-sinkers. One has only to recall the variety of attitudes on the balustrade of the temple of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>-Nike at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> to realize that we must not expect every sculptural treatment to have its reflection on the coins.<ref target="#CH1-n25">
                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
               </ref> Here and there, however, a type does appear not connected with any of the commoner treatments with which we have been dealing. An instance of this is the unique gold piece of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_abydus">Abydus</placeName> of the late 5th or early 4th century (<ref target="#fig-41">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 10</ref>) showing Nike kneeling upon a ram that she is about to sacrifice. Whether this is an original conception of the artist or whether it goes back to an earlier group we cannot tell. There is a similar group, in which Nike is slaying a bull, reappearing frequently on later gems,<ref target="#CH1-n26">
                  <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
               </ref> but the only other occurrence of
<pb n="17"/>
just this coin type is on a gold stater of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-42">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 11</ref>) which is certainly a direct copy, made about 380 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n27">
                  <hi rend="sup">27</hi>
               </ref> The pattern is a very effective one and perhaps we should be satisfied to leave it at that without pressing the symbolism too far. The sacrifice of a victim is an obviously appropriate way of celebrating a victory; to have the sacrifice performed by Victory herself is a symbolic ellipsis very unlike the frank and obvious meaning of the Nike of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>. There may, of course, have been local conditions which made it all plain to the users of the coins, but the precise meaning is lost to us. We may remark, however, that the purely decorative element is quite as strong here as at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName> and may quite possibly dominate the symbolic. Is it an aspect of this that Nike now appears nude to the waist, whereas at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_abydus">Abydus</placeName> and in the West she is clothed?<ref target="#CH1-n28">
                  <hi rend="sup">28</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>There is another gold piece of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-43">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 12</ref>) which is connected with a new motif altogether. So far the only specific idea involved in the coins we have considered
<pb n="18"/>
is that of the games. Though it has been weakened and generalized it has not been replaced by anything recognizably military. But there are exceptions to this rule. On a rare hemidrachm of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName> Nike is shown with a large round shield (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 1). This appears to be the first numismatic instance of the warlike aspect of Nike which later becomes so very prominent. It must be confessed, however, that since the hemidrachm is of about the same time as the drachm of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName> already mentioned (<ref target="#fig-19">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 2</ref>) it introduces the possibility that the latter, and perhaps other examples of the goddess alone, may have had a military meaning which we should have had no reason to suspect. We are helped to define this particular victory by late 5th century litrae and bronzes from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_himera">Himera</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-45">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 2</ref>) on which Nike (named by the inscription) carries an aphlaston. Since it was customary to tear off this ornament attached to the stern of a war vessel and display it as a sign of victory, scholars are agreed in the doctrine that the aphlaston signifies a naval victory.<ref target="#CH1-n29">
                  <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
               </ref> Now it is not difficult to decide what victory would be celebrated in the late 5th century by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_himera">Himera</placeName>. We know from <persName>Thucydides VII</persName>, 1 that she joined <persName>Gylippus</persName>. She was his headquarters while he was waiting to make his way into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, supplied him with a contingent and furnished arms for the crews of his ships. Later, when she attempted to send him reinforcements, they were ambushed by the Sicels on instructions from <persName>Nicias</persName> and cut to pieces. The final defeat of the Athenians, therefore, would be an obvious cause of joy in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_himera">Himera</placeName>, and when it is remembered that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_camarina">Camarina</placeName> also was an ally of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> in 413 (<persName>Thucydides VII</persName>, 58) it is clear that these lesser issues were saying in their own way what <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> said with the great issue of decadrachms, and
<pb n="19"/>
that the little Nikes are here for the first time unmistakable goddesses of victory in war.<ref target="#CH1-n29a">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Another coin to which a warlike significance has been attached is an electrum stater of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> showing Nike kneeling and holding an aphlaston, with the city's regular tunny fish beneath (<ref target="#fig-46">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 3</ref>). There is difference among the authorities as to its date, and consequently, as to its meaning. Without going into the guesses of earlier writers, we may cite <persName>William Greenwell</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n30">
                  <hi rend="sup">30</hi>
               </ref> who thinks it may have been struck to commemorate the victory of <persName>Alcibiades</persName> over the Spartan fleet off <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> in 410. "This," says Mr. <persName>Greenwood</persName>, "is perhaps the first instance where Nike appears on a coin as the goddess of victory in war. On the coins of other Greek states she seems to be, up to this date and onwards, until the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and the <persName>Diadochi</persName>, the goddess of agonistic victory." <persName>Ernest Babelon</persName> endorses this judgment,<ref target="#CH1-n31">
                  <hi rend="sup">31</hi>
               </ref> though he mentions the other dates that have been suggested, 394 and 375 since 410 seems to him too early for the style. <persName>Von Fritze</persName>, without committing himself to any specific occasion, lists the piece in his Class III, which he dates ca. 475-ca. 410, thus excluding the later suggestions.<ref target="#CH1-n32">
                  <hi rend="sup">32</hi>
               </ref> Finally Mrs. <persName>Brett</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n33">
                  <hi rend="sup">33</hi>
               </ref> gives her opinion that the stater is of fourth century style and "doubtless commemorates the victory of <persName>Conon</persName> and <persName>Pharnabazus</persName> over the Spartans off <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cnidus">Cnidus</placeName> in 394." In spite of this variation of the date, there is unanimity in the belief that a naval victory is intended. We have

just seen, however, that it is not the first instance of this symbolism.</p>
            <p>To return to our second <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-43">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 12</ref>) gold piece; her significance is certainly clear enough for she is kneeling before a trophy of arms to the top of which she is nailing a helmet. Like the earlier goddess, she is nude to the waist, and the artist's interest has obviously been quite as much directed to decoration as to symbolism. At the same time it is hard to believe that she does not refer to a specific event of local importance. The event has not been identified,<ref target="#CH1-n34">
                  <hi rend="sup">34</hi>

                  <hi rend="sup">35</hi>
               </ref> would place it about 355. Before <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, then, the military function of Nike, destined to loom so large in her symbolism, was already established on the coin types.</p>

               <p>This study began as a paper in the Yale Graduate School by <persName>Dr. Marjorie Alkins</persName> (<placeName>Berlincourt</placeName>) in 1951. Its initial purpose was to discover, if possible, the appearance of the Victory of the Roman Senate which played so conspicuous a part in the religious controversy of the fourth Christian century. This proved to be an unexpectedly elusive question but in its pursuit the author gathered a large amount of information about the use of Victory on coins, which she presented as a history of the type. There have been some modifications both of form and of content in the intervening years and photographs for illustration have been collected to supplement her original descriptions. It would not be easy now to say how much of the present text is precisely as she wrote it. Since it has not been practicable to collaborate with her since her leaving <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, I may not always have represented her present opinions, and she cannot be charged with errors which I may have introduced. But the work is essentially hers and I am grateful for her permission to make this use of it.</p>

               <p>Since these coins are dated by style ca. 510–485 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>., we have no way of proving that those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> are earlier, but the logic of the types would seem to make it sure that the independent figure was the original, the accessory figure of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> the adaptation.

               <p>It seems, <hi rend="italic">pace</hi> the British Museum Catalogue that the Nike of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName> always wears a chiton. It is certain that she generally does so, and it seems unlikely that a detail of such importance would be subject to the artist's whim. But the chiton is represented as very light and transparent and with a little wearing of the coin it would become invisible.

            <p>The accession of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName> opens a new epoch in the history of our type. The Nike which appears on the reverse of the gold, an innovation to Macedonian issues (<ref target="#fig-47">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 4</ref>), will be discussed in my forthcoming <hi rend="italic">Essays on the Coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is one matter of great importance for our present purpose. The gold of <persName>Philip</persName> had displayed a head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_apollo_priene">Apollo</persName> and a chariot: a guardian deity and a memorial of his own glory—a divine effigy and a personal one. Nike is to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> what the winning chariot had been to his father. The idea underlying the choice of this type is unprecedented. Though the concept of Nike had widened as it spread from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_elis_elis">Elis</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_magna_graecia">South Italy</placeName>, where her increasing generalization enabled her to commemorate any kind of victory, she never became a completely abstract attribute, always rather retaining her relation to some specific event. It is true that she might have a particular temporary association with some city, some other deity or some mint magistrate, and the last phenomenon occasionally appears under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n36">
                  <hi rend="sup">36</hi>
               </ref> But the type, as it appears on <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s coins embodies a new and abstract idea, for now she has become one of his attributes or possessions and belongs to him, presented not in commemoration of a particular victory, but to signify the career of conquest that he set out for himself. The audacious assumption was brilliantly fulfilled, and it was proper that the great car that bore his coffin should have been decorated at each of its corners with a golden Nike.<ref target="#CH1-n37">
                  <hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had an abundance of good generals but none so clearly superior to his fellows that he could be considered a natural successor, and the ambiguous indications given by the conqueror on his deathbed showed that there was no single person on whom could be concentrated either his hopes or his fears for the continued power of his family. It soon became apparent that there was no lack of individual ambition ajnong his followers, but their uneasy compromise by which his half-brother <persName>Philip</persName> and his posthumous son <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> were made equal sovereigns proved that his estate was still too great a power to be challenged by any of his subordinates. The empire was still his as the victory had been his. Of this the coins are evidence; the same types were still minted. To be sure, the legend BAΣIΛEΩΣ AΛEΞANΔPOY would designate the young son just as well as the dead conqueror. In addition the types were universally known and established as an international currency which might be continued and was continued without raising the dangerous question of the rival claims of conflicting generals. Supported by the deification of the hero and the cult that was beginning to be established this continuation outlasted the life of the younger <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and as late as 280 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. a tetradrachm from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pergamum">Pergamum</placeName> still purports to be the issue of his father.<ref target="#CH1-n38">
                  <hi rend="sup">38</hi>
               </ref> The position of <persName>Philip III</persName>, however, raised a problem. Though he had ardent supporters among the Macedonian soldiery, his estimation in the eyes of the rest of the world can never have been as high as that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s son. If the imperial coins bore only <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s name it would certainly make <persName>Philip</persName> seem to be an inferior. On the other hand if different types were chosen for <persName>Philip</persName> it would suggest a most undesirable division between the co-rulers. The solution was to strike the same types, but, on some of the coins, replace the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> with that of <persName>Philip</persName>. It was a natural

compromise and was doubtless accepted by the citizenry without much attention but, in the case of Nike, it really emphasizes how much the coinage was that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s estate instead of that of his successors.

            <p>At about the time that <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName>'s new reverses were appearing (310–304 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.), an unprecedented Nike, quite unrelated to the Macedonian, was struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> to commemorate his victory over the Carthaginians in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-49">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 6</ref>). This goddess, like the kneeling figure of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-43">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 12</ref>) is nude to the waist and is about to nail a helmet to the top of a trophy. It would be rash to insist that the later coin was influenced by the earlier since we have no evidence that the earlier ever found its way to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName>, but it must be remarked that this gold and silver of <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName> shows a figure very different from the earlier tradition of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and from the contemporary currency of the East, except for issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus I</persName> from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_susa">Susa</placeName> and Persepolis which will be presently considered. Whatever its inspiration, the Sicilian issue shares with the <orgName type="ethnic">Lampsacene</orgName> gold a character of which the decorative element is quite as important as the symbolic.</p>
            <p>Associated with this type for silver is a gold didrachm of <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName> with a young head in elephant's skin headdress on the obverse and, on the reverse, a winged <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>, armed, with an owl at her feet (<ref target="#fig-50">

               </ref> It was the constant aim of <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName>, a <hi rend="italic">novus homo,</hi> to establish his position among the Macedonian princes, and it was following in their footsteps that he took the title of king soon after 305 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. The most interesting thing about the present type for us is that the addition of wings to <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName>'s <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> gives the same kind of conflation of Nike with another deity which we have already met at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName> and which becomes common in the Roman empire.</p>
            <p>Although the coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> was the first to break from the tradition of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, independent paths were eventually followed by some of his rivals also. There are two dates of capital importance for us in the early history of the successors: 306–305 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. and 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. The former is the time when the generals took the title of king, <persName>Cassander</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thrace">Thrace</placeName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName> and his son <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrius</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylonia">Babylonia</placeName>, and <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. With <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> we have already dealt; <persName>Cassander</persName> does not concern us for he always adhered to the types and name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. Almost the same can be said of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName>, but he is responsible for one interesting though ephemeral variation. In 306 <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrius</persName> won a great naval victory over <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> off <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName> and in that year <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName> founded the city of <placeName>Antigonea</placeName> on the Orontes to serve as the capital of his empire. On the first tetradrachm issued from the new city the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref>, in other respects indistinguishable from that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, holds not an eagle but a little Nike about to place a wreath on his head<ref target="#CH1-n46">

Presumably the problem was settled to the satisfaction of the devout at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName> adopted the solution with the goddess. In any case his natural conservatism reasserted itself at once, and his subsequent tetradrachms from <placeName>Antigonea</placeName> like those from all his other mints show the usual eagle on the hand of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref>.<ref target="#CH1-n48">

<pb n="28"/>
die-sinkers were their own masters the remoteness of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> would create a difficulty. But it is clear now that types are not the creation of artists but the selection of officials whose chief concern was with meaning rather than with form. We know of no specific connection between the courts of <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName>, but the <placeName>Syracusan</placeName> was certainly in sufficiently close relation with the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> kings in the East for them to have been acquainted with his coins. It was the government which decided that his type should be imitated and the government which decreed that the imitations should be struck only at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_susa">Susa</placeName> and Persepolis. We cannot say how much the government was responsible for the modifications which are interesting though not, it would seem, of much symbolic importance. For one thing, the goddess is now clothed instead of being nude to the waist, for another she now holds a wreath instead of hammer and nail. Both these changes bring her into direct relation with the Nike of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. For a third thing, instead of greaves attached at the bottom of a bare trunk there is now a shoot with leaves at the side. If this change has a meaning it escapes us now. But quite evidently the difference in execution was beyond the government's control. The stiff folds of the drapery show an awkward hand and, more important still, the revised pose brings the figure into profile instead of the almost frontal body of <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName>' Nike produced by the right arm hanging down with the hammer. Yet the display of wings to right and left is retained though now it produces an anatomical impossibility. Perhaps <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName> did as well to keep his type from too close inspection by the more accomplished artists of the West.</p>
            <p>It was not the victors alone who made use of the battle of Ipsus.

for supremacy on land might have failed disastrously, but <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrius</persName> still controlled the sea. Though the victory of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName> was some years past its effects were not diminished. He therefore abandoned the conservatism of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName> and struck one of the most notable types of antiquity (<ref target="#fig-53">

fact that these types were issued at almost all <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrius</persName>' mints and were issued for many years makes this a more vigorous statement of peculiar right to Nike than that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName>, but both are symbols of particular victories rather than claims to Victory herself as a special and perpetual possession after the fashion of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrius</persName> did, it is true, like <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName> use his own name on gold with the Nike of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, but this was not an enduring profession of equality, for he presently gave it up for new types with only human figures. As for his successors the Antigonid kings of Macedon, their types followed other conventions and never returned to Nike.</p>
            <p>About 297 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> produced a new general issue on which the same types were used for both silver and gold simultaneously from all mints (<ref target="#fig-54">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 3</ref>, <ref target="#fig-55">4</ref>).

On her outstretched right hand is a little Nike who is crowning the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>. It was an adroit invention. The choice of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s portrait was at once an act of modesty and an assertion of that close connection with him so important to all his associates. The reverse device suggests a less assured claim on victory than <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s Nike, but a superior claim to that of the <persName>Zeus Nicephorus</persName> of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName>. As in the old days at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> Nike is not a source but an agent and it is <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> the wise and warlike goddess by whom the victory is given. But by the pretty conceit of allowing the king's name to stand for the king it was made to appear that <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>, while no longer the possessor of victory was the regular recipient, an idea quite as valuable for his purposes.

after his death in 281 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. the cities continued to strike them as an international coinage. Thus, though <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> had no heirs, his memory persisted in the country he had ruled when that of his rivals had been forgotten.</p>
            <p>In 280 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName>, whose final fortune it was to conquer his old ally <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>, died a violent death himself and there were none left of the great group that had been companions of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. If we consider their use of Nike as a type we may fancy that something of the essential quality of the men is illustrated in this minor fashion: <persName>Cassander</persName>'s lack of originality and imagination which led him to attempt to continue what he had received without change or addition; <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName>'s far-sighted embracing of a separatist policy which brought about an entire break with the tradition; the cautious conservatism of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName> intent on using to the full the advantage of appearing <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s true successor; the bold innovation of his son <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrius</persName> with confidence enough in himself to replace the victory of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> by a victory of his own; finally the calculating statesmanship of <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> looking for a formula that would express the importance of tradition and at the same time recognize the new age which they intended to dominate.

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 7</ref>). But between these instances of

a well established <placeName>Syracusan</placeName> device comes the period from 278 to 276 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> when <persName corresp="#nomisma_hicetas">Pyrrhus</persName>, the adventurous wanderer through <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> turmoil, finding that his campaign against the Romans in South <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> was progressing less rapidly than he could desire, was diverted by the opportunity of commanding the united Sicilians in a war against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</placeName>. Like all the other episodes of his career, the conception was larger than the performance, but the spirit in which he undertook what ultimately proved to be too big a task for him is shown by the gold struck for him at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> bearing what might be called a Sicilian translation of the Nike of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> (<ref target="#fig-59">

It was in two denominations and with two varieties of Nike, one with one wing falling behind the body, the other with both wings displayed, both carrying a wreath and trophy. Both have a Sicilian grace quite unlike the sobriety of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s type, but otherwise the announcement of a special title to victory is like that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, differing only in the fact that its use was much restricted both in time and space.<ref target="#CH1-n58">

It is more likely that this is merely a royal complimentary and conventional recognition of the fact that Aradus herself associated victory with her city-goddess, as shown by the series of municipal tetradrachms which began in 138–7 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n62">

               <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus Nicator</persName>'s interesting type of Nike and a trophy (<ref target="#fig-52">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 1</ref>) was never reproduced in its original form, but it gave rise to two variations. The first appears on three denominations of bronze struck by <persName>Antiochus I</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_seleuceia_ad_tigrim">Seleucia</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-62">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 2</ref>). Though they are from different mints, the later bronze must surely have been influenced by the earlier silver, but how very different it is! Not only has the sober portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName> been replaced by a sentimental facing head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_apollo_priene">Apollo</persName>, but the goddess of the reverse, so quiet and seemly on the tetradrachm, has been transformed to a violently active figure. <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>

battle. Perhaps, as he says, "the new types may have borne a general, rather than a specific, implication." It would be unsafe to count this as a sure instance of a particular victory celebrated by a coin type, but at least there is general agreement that it is later than the design of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName>, which may therefore be taken to account for its striking and unusual appearance.</p>
            <p>The second variation recurs on three denominations of bronze struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_ii">Seleucus II</persName> at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris ca. 240–230 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. (<ref target="#fig-64">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 4</ref>). Although the profile of <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus I</persName> on the obverse has been replaced by heads of the Dioscuri and the group on the reverse is in the opposite direction, there can be no doubt that this is an intentional reflection of the earlier eastern tetradrachms, for the object of uncertain shape between Nike and the trophy turns out, on close inspection of some specimens, to be a bull's head, the well-known symbol of the first <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName>. <persName>Newell</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n71">
                  <hi rend="sup">71</hi>
               </ref> suggests that the occasion may have been the assembling of the expedition which was to win back the eastern lands originally held by <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus Nicator</persName> and that his namesake recalled his victorious type as an omen and an encouragement to the people of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_seleuceia_ad_tigrim">Seleucia</placeName>. Nike here, then, has a double excuse for being: pious tradition and pious hope. Very often among the later Seleucids the hope of victory outruns its achievement and Nike appears optimistically on the coins of monarchs whose fortunes were anything but triumphant. Except for the bull's head and the palm which Nike bears, the new group adds nothing to the old. The goddess has recovered from the excitement she displayed under <persName>Antiochus I</persName> and is now a fair replica of the original type, with such inferiority as might be expected from the difference in time and resources of the two kings and from the fact that a bronze type seldom displays the care that is spent on a major silver issue.</p>
            <pb n="36"/>
            <p>The only important innovation for our purpose is a type which appears on two denominations of bronze (<ref target="#fig-65">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 5</ref>) attributed by <persName>Newell</persName> to <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_ii">Seleucus II</persName> at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris, ca. 240–230 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, without perfect assurance, since their monograms are not identical with those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_seleuceia_ad_tigrim">Seleucia</placeName> and the coins themselves have not been recorded from the excavations of that city.<ref target="#CH1-n72">
                  <hi rend="sup">72</hi>
               </ref> But the question of the mint is of minor importance for us, and the identity of the king may be taken as sure. In a sense the symbolism is only that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> made more explicit. Instead of the king's name crowned by victory, it is now the king himself who is crowned. But though the symbolism is the same, the unprecedented use of the figure of the monach in military garb seems to suggest a special occasion and perhaps the fact that the type is not repeated either by <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_ii">Seleucus II</persName> or by his successors may be taken as evidence that there is a single occasion for this issue. In this case, however, as <persName>Newell</persName> points out, there are two such occasions available: one when <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus</persName> drove back the Parthian king <persName>Tiridates</persName> who had previously defeated his lieutenants, the other when he drove back his rebel brother <persName corresp="#nomisma_antiochus_hierax">Antiochus Hierax</persName> who had taken advantage of his absence in the east to invade <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</placeName>. The second case is perhaps not quite so clear as the first, but both give occasion for the greater precision of this new type: though subordinates may be beaten, when the king himself takes the field Nike is with him. This type, then, we may class with some probability as celebrating a particular victory.</p>
            <p>The use of Nike alone was common but uninspired. <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus I</persName> had transferred <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s gold type to bronze still bearing <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s name at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_susa">Susa</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-66">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 6</ref>) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ecbatana">Ecbatana</placeName>.

                  <hi rend="sup">73</hi>
               </ref> One or other of these varieties was used by a great many succeeding monarchs. In some cases Nike crowns the king's name, in some she holds her wreath over the <orgName corresp="#nomisma_seleucid_dynasty" type="dynasty">Seleucid</orgName> dynastic anchor but the only important variation in her attitude is that on rare occasions she is drawn to the right rather than to the left.<ref target="#CH1-n74">
                  <hi rend="sup">74</hi>
               </ref> By the later kings the type is used for small silver as well as for bronze (<ref target="#fig-68">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 8</ref>). In both cases it is only one of several types available,<ref target="#CH1-n75">
                  <hi rend="sup">75</hi>
               </ref> and never therefore has the symbolic importance of Nikeon <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s gold. The question naturally arises whether these Nikes had specific historical occasions or whether they had become a mere stereotype. To this we cannot give any clear answer. The lives of the later Seleucids were so full of fighting that any of them might have achieved a passable imitation of a victory, and the record of the times is so very fragmentary that nothing at all can be deduced from the silence of the authors. But if one cannot deny that a particular Nike may celebrate a particular forgotten battle, one must admit that other factors play a part in the convention. For example, Timarchus struck bronze at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ecbatana">Ecbatana</placeName> showing a Nike to the left; it is true that his brief career from 162–160 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> saw him take possession of Media, which might account for the type; it is also true that the predecessor of his issue is that of <persName>Antiochus III</persName> from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ecbatana">Ecbatana</placeName> bearing the same Nike, and
<pb n="38"/>
the borrowing of the legitimate ruler's type has its political uses irrespective of its symbolism. Again, <persName>Demetrius III</persName> struck a Nike on his bronze from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</placeName> for four years between 96 and 87 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n76">
                  <hi rend="sup">76</hi>
               </ref> His winning of the town in 96–5 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. may explain the first of these, but the year 88–87 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was so inglorious for him that the last of them is to be explained only as a vain repetition of a device once adopted. Finally it may be remarked that no victory of a king later than <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus I</persName> was of sufficient importance to be recorded on an issue of big silver.</p>
            <p>As one gets farther from <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> there is a sense of the fading out of royal personality. This is certainly largely the result of the deterioration of our sources. Nobody in his time thought of <persName>Antiochus III</persName> or <persName>Antiochus IV</persName> as a feeble personality. Yet the general decline is a reality. The monarchs set their ambitions on lower goals, they governed with lessening resources, their gains were slighter and more ephemeral, their losses more frequent and more vital. Nike might still appear on their coins but she was hardly a goddess any more. She was a memorial without honesty, a hope without conviction, a numismatic cliché from which the life had departed.</p>
            <p>Like other types that had become conventional, Nike was borrowed by the kings of the partly Hellenized lands. There may well have been times when her appearance on the coins of some dynast signified a greater or lesser triumph, but interesting as the hunt for such occasions might be for political history, it adds nothing to the history of the type. The semi-barbarous royal Nikes are figures of little beauty and no individuality, and the same is true for the great majority of Nikes which appear, either as type or symbol, on the coinages of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> cities. They are numerous, and for the most part, uninteresting. There are cases, however, where a civic issue is noteworthy.</p>
            <pb n="39"/>
            <p>A conspicuous example is on the series of tetradrachms struck by Aradus from 138–7 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. (<ref target="#fig-67">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 7</ref>) to 46–5 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n77">
                  <hi rend="sup">77</hi>
               </ref> It is suggested that this appearance of larger silver from a mint which had never struck such ambitious pieces before may have been occasioned by the destruction of her rival <placeName corresp="#nomisma_marathus">Marathus</placeName>. It would be tempting to suppose that the Nike now selected as a reverse type commemorated that event, but it must be remembered that her association with the Tyche of Aradus, whose head adorns this obverse, had already been expressed by the coin of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> Balas already referred to,<ref target="#CH1-n78">
                  <hi rend="sup">78</hi>
               </ref> though the attempt of that king as ally of the city to destroy <placeName corresp="#nomisma_marathus">Marathus</placeName> was a failure. On whatever occasion the selection was made, Nike now becomes the official sign of the city for nearly a century. The aphlaston which she carries in her right hand certainly testifies to the naval might of Aradus whether or not it celebrates a particular naval victory. The figure is carefully drawn and attractive at the beginning, with the seemliness and dignity of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s Nike and with somewhat more grace. But succeeding die-sinkers were not now independent artists nor were they treated as such. Their duty was unvarying reproduction of the figure officially prescribed, and if the start of the series is a pleasure to the eye, before it reaches its end it has become a lamentable example of what officialdom can do to art (<ref target="#fig-69">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 9</ref>). One has only to remember the charm and variety of the Nikes of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName> to see one of the gulfs between the pre-Alexandrine and post-Alexandrine worlds. The symbolism was reasonably justified, however; though the career of Aradus may not have been invariably victorious, her importance and general success were great enough to give her a respectable title to her Nike.</p>
            <pb n="40"/>
            <p>A case of quite a different sort is that of the issue of identical types in the time of <persName>Mithradates Eupator</persName> (120–63 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) by a group of cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pontus">Pontus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paphlagonia">Paphlagonia</placeName>: <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-70">

The goddess is ugly and there is nothing remarkable in her position except the odd way in which she holds the wreath behind her as though she were about to throw it.

In the same way we later find in the Roman empire cases of ostensible civic types that are in fact a part of the imperial propaganda.</p>
            <p>Issues of the <orgName>Boeotian League</orgName> show how entirely devoid of meaning a type can become.

head are those of Nike and remind us of the strange fact that, closely as she had come to be associated with war as distinguished from all other types of victory, she is very rarely shown in combat. This is an interesting combination of divinities and prepares us for unusual features in other <placeName>Boeotian</placeName> types. And such we presently find.</p>
            <p>Silver drachms have a head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41127">Poseidon</ref> on the obverse, Nike holding a trident on the reverse (<ref target="#fig-71">

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 12</ref>). The trident in her hand might be supposed to refer to a naval victory, but since no such event is known to which the type could possibly apply, we must conclude that the trident is no more than the usual symbol of the <placeName>Boeotian</placeName> god <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41127">Poseidon</ref>, whose figure appears on other <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> coins of the League.<ref target="#CH1-n82">
                  <hi rend="sup">82</hi>
               </ref> This, then, is the second <placeName>Boeotian</placeName> instance of Nike endowed with the attributes of another deity. But Nike herself creates a difficulty. Head's date for the beginning of the issue, which has been generally accepted, is 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, the year of <persName corresp="#nomisma_flamininus">Flamininus</persName>' victory over <persName>Philip V</persName> at <placeName>Cynoscephalae</placeName>. This would certainly give an occasion for the type, since the <orgName type="ethnic">Boeotians</orgName> were the allies of <persName corresp="#nomisma_flamininus">Flamininus</persName>. But they were far from enthusiastic allies, having merely yielded to Roman pressure, and indeed a <placeName>Boeotian</placeName> contingent fought at <placeName>Cynoscephalae</placeName> in <persName>Philip</persName>'s army. Even at the beginning, therefore, the appearance of the new type would have given a dubious satisfaction to the Boeotians, and as time went on its propriety would have grown more and more doubtful since relations with <persName corresp="#nomisma_flamininus">Flamininus</persName> became much worse in the next year, and in 192 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. when <persName>Antiochus III</persName> crossed the <placeName>Aegean</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> the Boeo-

tians at once joined him against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. His defeat and their second surrender did not keep at least a portion of them from joining <persName corresp="#nomisma_perseus">Perseus</persName> in 173 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, and when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> protested the League was broken up. Yet the number of magistrates' monograms known proves that this series was of considerable duration, quite enough, indeed, to account for the whole period from <placeName>Cynoscephalae</placeName> to the dissolution of the League. Surely this is only explicable if one assumes that Nike had become a figure entirely devoid of real significance.</p>
            <p>An alternative date of 245 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> for the series has recently been proposed by <persName>Michel Feyel</persName>, but this is only an exchange of dilemmas.<ref target="#CH1-n83">
                  <hi rend="sup">83</hi>
               </ref> The year 245 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. saw the Boeotians forced into alliance with the Aetolians as the result of a bad defeat by the latter near <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chaeroneia">Chaeroneia</placeName>. At some date after 239 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.—the year is still disputed—they extricated themselves from this humiliating association and joined <persName>Demetrius II</persName>, King of Macedon. If the first appearance of Nike in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. would cause surprise, in 245 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. it would be almost incredible. Doubtless in the period after 239 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. there were events which might be construed as <placeName>Boeotian</placeName> victories but, again, a long series can be given place only on the assumption that the type was continued after it had ceased to be appropriate: that is, it had lost its meaning.</p>
            <p>There is one creation of a <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> city, however, which is at once beautiful and an ingenious addition to the symbolism of our goddess. On some of the abundant didrachms of <placeName>Tarentum</placeName> the founder <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> rides his inevitable dolphin but holds in his hand a little Nike who crowns him (<ref target="#fig-73">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 1</ref>): that is the demigod <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> who is, of course, the city itself, has been exalted to the usual position of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> or <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>, at once the author and the recipient of victory. This may be doubtful theology, but as a metaphor of the city made glorious by victory of her own creation it is a pretty

and effective figure. It is a conceit to which we need not attach too much importance. For one thing Nike is only one of a number of things that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> may hold; for another, its intermittent occurrence from the fourth century<ref target="#CH1-n84">

                  <persName>Newell</persName>, op. cit., pp. 35–38 argues strongly for the view that the ship is one of the defeated vessels, the acrostolium torn away. If it were not for this interpretation of the curious notched appearance of the stolos one might more readily assume that the ship was <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrius</persName>' own and that the trumpet blast was sounding the attack, since we know that trumpets were used for just that purpose at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName> (<persName>Diodorus</persName> XX, 51, 2). But we know also that the trumpet was used to announce a victory—though I know of no case referring to a naval victory. Cf. the article "<placeName>Tuba</placeName>" by <persName>A.

            <p>Unlike the lesser barbarians who surrounded the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> world, the Romans had an independent numismatic tradition and a fine one. There is no Greek parallel to the great series of <hi rend="italic">aes signatum</hi> of the Republic. Yet contact with the Greek cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> affected the Romans too, and shortly after their power had been established in the South the first Roman Victory appears on a silver didrachm struck in that region, perhaps in the city of <placeName>Tarentum</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n86">

Her relation to the Nike of <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName> (<ref target="#fig-49">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 6</ref>) is sufficiently obvious, though this is not merely a copy but a very competent piece of composition. In place of the trophy there is now a long palm branch to which Victory is attaching a wreath with a fillet. The act extends both arms and brings the body around so that it is viewed more from the side. The wings are properly to the left instead of displayed, but the flexibility of the figure is preserved by the bent right leg. The palm and wreath to the right with serial letter beneath, and the inscription to the left fill the space comfortably. But there is a type closer to the Roman than the Nike of <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName> both in time and in form. A bronze of <placeName>Tarentum</placeName> has a Nike to the right holding a thunderbolt. The combination of type and symbol is convincingly connected with <persName corresp="#nomisma_hicetas">Pyrrhus</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_epirus">Epirus</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n87">
                  <hi rend="sup">87</hi>
               </ref> To the Tarentine die-sinkers of his time, therefore, the credit must go for the successful alteration of the figure's pose to eliminate the trophy without leaving space undesirably vacant.<ref target="#CH1-n88">
                  <hi rend="sup">88</hi>
               </ref> The designers for the Romans would then have to hand a Nike from <placeName>Tarentum</placeName> itself in bronze, to be sure, but suitable as a basis for the first type of the new masters of South <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>. Their elimination of the thunderbolt, the sign of the Epirote King, would be a matter of course, but the substitution of the conventional palm produces an arrangement sufficiently specific without being an affront to the vanquished. Altogether it is an auspicious beginning to Victory's career on the Roman coinage.</p>
            <p>From <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> itself was later issued another coin of <placeName>Syracusan</placeName> inspiration, the so-called quadrigatus (<ref target="#fig-75">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 3</ref>) showing <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4649">Jupiter</ref> with a thunderbolt driving a quadriga to
<pb n="46"/>
the right, with a little Victory behind him. The composition is uninteresting and the execution poor. The theology also is dubious and the whole thing a disappointing contrast to the preceding which had clearly been the work of a good Greek artist. Nor is the decorative standard much raised by the victoriatus (<ref target="#fig-76">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 4</ref>) introduced to replace the half-quadrigatus.<ref target="#CH1-n89">
                  <hi rend="sup">89</hi>
               </ref> This also originates at the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and is a much simplified version of <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName>' group. North Italian sobriety has presented the goddess fully clad. She is in profile, though on early specimens her weight is still on the left foot with the right knee bent. The gesture of crowning the trophy is a simpler attitude than that of the didrachm, but the meaning of the type was clear and apparently satisfying to the Romans, for it persisted for a long time, getting stiffer and increasingly careless.</p>
            <p>The original reverse type of the denarius was the <persName corresp="#nomisma_dioskuri_byzantium">Dioscuri</persName> on galloping horses. An alternative was <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q132543">Diana</ref> driving a biga to the right, and <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q132543">Diana</ref> later came to be replaced by Victory (<ref target="#fig-77">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 5</ref>). Of course this, like the type of the quadrigatus, is a borrowing from the Greek, without beauty or special significance to make it notable.<ref target="#CH1-n90">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>There are a number of variations of the chariot type: a quadriga or triga instead of biga; Victory crowning the horses or the charioteer. These occur at different times and give no further light on the Roman principles and practice of adaptation. There is, however, one concentration of

powers which is worth mentioning as showing the Roman instinct for impressiveness at the expense of finesse. A denarius of <persName>C.

(<ref target="#fig-78">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 6</ref>).

            <p>Victories appear frequently throughout the Republic, but most of them are such bare conventions as to call for no comment. There are two exceptions, however, in the time of the Social Wars, for in both cases the Roman reverse is borrowed by the Italian insurgents. The first is a denarius of M. <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_cato_rrc">Cato</persName> showing Victory seated with the inscription VICTRIX (<ref target="#fig-79">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 7</ref>). <persName>Mommsen</persName> identified the reverse type as the cult statue in the aedicula of Victoria Virgo dedicated by <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_cato_rrc">Cato</persName> the Elder in 194 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. to celebrate his Spanish campaign. The figure does indeed have the appearance of a particular statue<ref target="#CH1-n91">
                  <hi rend="sup">91</hi>
               </ref> but it must have been understood in a general sense as well, for there are rare denarii copying both obverse and reverse, but with the inscription changed to ITALIA.<ref target="#CH1-n92">
                  <hi rend="sup">92</hi>
               </ref> A clearer case still is that of the denarius on which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> is depicted seated on a pile of arms, crowned by Victory standing behind (<ref target="#fig-80">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 8</ref>). This is an evident picture of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> victorious in the war, again parodied by a denarius of the insurgents on which the legend ROMA is replaced by ITALIA.<ref target="#CH1-n93">

Aside from the difficulty produced by the hypothesis that one of the moneyers would be allowed to use a picture of himself being crowned as a symbol, and the lack of a Quintus of the proper eminence at the proper time, there is positive evidence that the figure is not a human. Miss <persName>Thompson</persName>'s work with the New Style tetradrachms has made it clear that this series is immediately preceded by one struck by <persName>Xenokles</persName> and <persName>Harmoxenos</persName> on which also the seated figure appears though not crowned by Nike.<ref target="#CH1-n95">

Whether that divinity be <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> or not is doubtful since she appears before the year of Quintus, whose inclusion among the Attic mint magistrates is the chief reason for assuming Roman influence. In any case the author of the denarius had the precedent of a similar group with a seated goddess crowned by Victory.</p>
            <p>In general it may be said that the importance of the Roman types is in their association or the ideas behind them, and seldom in their art. Republican coins have their own attractiveness and their own value, but no one can feel that the Republican die-sinkers are as skilful as their Greek predecessors. They illustrate interesting events, and they more rarely give form to interesting conceptions, but it is the event or the conception which is of importance, not the form. To list all the modifications of a well-known figure, therefore,
<pb n="49"/>
would advance our subject very little. One innovation, however, is worthy of remark: the substitution of a bust of Victory for the whole figure (<ref target="#fig-81">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 9</ref>). This appears late in the Republic<ref target="#CH1-n97">
                  <hi rend="sup">97</hi>
               </ref> and was used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>. The increase in scale of the portrait gave opportunity to show the features of real persons—though whether this was actually done or not is a matter of dispute—but the loss in dignity is conspicuous and the bust was never a serious competitor of the full figure.</p>
            <p>The fashion of moneyers of recording the great deeds of their ancestors makes it certain that Victory would occur prominently on these reminiscent series. As the Republic drew to its close, however, contemporary events began to intrude among the historical ones, and some Victories of the civil wars have especial point as illustrative of the propaganda of rival chiefs. An instance is that of the gold and silver struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_l_manli_t_proq_rrc">L. Manlius</persName> and <persName>L. Sulla</persName> in 82–81 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>., possibly in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> itself, showing <persName corresp="#nomisma_sulla">Sulla</persName> in a triumphal quadriga crowned by Victory (<ref target="#fig-83">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 11</ref>). Although the group is a direct descendant of the Sicilian quadrigas, the significance is entirely different. The chariot is no longer the vehicle of a competitor in the games bearing him to triumph by its swiftness. It is the car of a Roman who has already triumphed, moving in solemn procession to celebrate that triumph. The earlier Greek meaning has therefore been entirely replaced.<ref target="#CH1-n98">

            <p>The type of <persName corresp="#nomisma_sulla">Sulla</persName>, it must be emphasized, was evidence of a fact of great religious importance. He claimed Victory as his own in a fashion less bold and simple than <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s but more explicit. After his defeat of the Samnites <persName corresp="#nomisma_sulla">Sulla</persName> instituted games to which he gave the name Ludi Sullanae

                  <hi rend="sup">99</hi>
               </ref> This was much more than commemorating "a victory won by <persName corresp="#nomisma_sulla">Sulla</persName>." It was a statement that his victory was a characteristic like his fortune or his valor. In this, as in other matters, <persName corresp="#nomisma_pompey">Pompey</persName> aped his chief and a rare aureus shows him in a similar triumphal quadriga, though here Victory crowns the horses, and an added feature is his young son <persName corresp="#nomisma_gnaeus_pompeius">Gnaeus</persName> riding one of them.<ref target="#CH1-n100">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>It was natural that Victory should have a prominent place among the types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Julius Caesar</persName>. The transition between Republican and Imperial coinage is manifest in the use of his portrait as an obverse type where no living Roman had ever appeared before. The supposed descent of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_julian_the_apostate">Julian</persName> gens from lulus the son of <persName>Aeneas</persName> is the reason for the use of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47652">Venus</ref>, the mother of <persName>Aeneas</persName>, as a reverse type (<ref target="#fig-84">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 1</ref>). Here she has the special form of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47652">Venus Victrix</ref>, not only equipped with spear and shield, but also holding a Victory with outstretched wreath. The obvious analogy with the <persName>Athena Nicephorus</persName> of the <orgName corresp="#nomisma_seleucid_dynasty" type="dynasty">Seleucids</orgName> is no accident. Like the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> Kings, <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> is asserting for his family a special connection with a goddess who brings victory. L. <persName corresp="#nomisma_l_aemilivs_bvca_rrc">Aemilius Buca</persName>, one of the moneyers who struck this common type used also another <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428995">Hellenistic</ref> reminiscence: Venus seated holding Victory (<ref target="#fig-85">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 2</ref>). But a more remarkable type of his shows a group much more complicated (<ref target="#fig-86">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 3</ref>). <persName>Sabatier</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> supposed this to refer to the myth of Endymion, but that would be an unparalleled representation for this time and, one would suppose, very obscure to the users of the coin. A better explanation is that of <persName>Eckhel</persName> who sees here a reference to the dream of <persName corresp="#nomisma_sulla">Sulla</persName>, reported by <persName>Plutarch</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_sulla">Sulla</persName>,</hi> ix). On his way to his contest with <persName>Marius</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> he had a vision of the moon putting a thunderbolt
<pb n="51"/>
in his hands and urging him to strike his enemies, who were thereupon vanquished. The winged figure in the middle is then Victory, symbolizing that of which the dream was itself a prophecy. The remarkable thing about this is the time of its appearance, for <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> was well known for the honor he rendered to the memory of <persName>Marius</persName> and one would little expect to find <persName corresp="#nomisma_sulla">Sulla</persName> so prominent on a type of one of his moneyers. But the fact seems to be that <persName corresp="#nomisma_l_aemilivs_bvca_rrc">Buca</persName> struck coins both before and after <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName>'s death in 43 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. If <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> be correct in his conjecture that <persName corresp="#nomisma_l_aemilivs_bvca_rrc">Buca</persName> was the son of <persName>M. Scaurus</persName> the step-son of <persName corresp="#nomisma_sulla">Sulla</persName>, it is easy to see why he should take advantage of the dictator's assassination to proclaim the distinction of his own house.<ref target="#CH1-n101">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>In currency, as in other matters, the brief regime of <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> was a prelude to the empire. His arrangements were revised, enlarged and confirmed by his heir in many ways that do not now concern us.<ref target="#CH1-n102">
                  <hi rend="sup">102</hi>
               </ref> What is of importance for our discussion is that the choice of types is no longer the result of a casual preference, but is part of a concerted plan for the influencing of public opinion. As <persName>Sutherland</persName> puts it, "It is a truth to be realized at the very outset that (<persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>), with the majority of his successors for at any rate two centuries or more, considered the choice of appropriate types as a matter of genuine importance in the conduct of empire."<ref target="#CH1-n103">

recognized as a turning point of history. As a matter of fact, on August 13, 14 and 15 of 29 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. three victories were celebrated, the Dalmatian, the Actian and the Alexandrine; and policy dictated that it should be the third of these, which had added immense resources to the Roman power, that should be emphasized, rather than the second, whose memory was always involved with that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> and the horrors of civil war.<ref target="#CH1-n104">

               </ref> The popularity which the type later achieved gives some, though doubtful, support to the possibility of its displaying a famous monument.</p>
            <p>The third pertinent early type of <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> is a silver quinarius bearing the cista mystica and serpents, long a standard type for Asiatic silver (<ref target="#fig-89">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 6</ref>). The addition of a Victory standing on the cista and the inscription <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">ASIA</placeName> RECEPTA was a reminder that though <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> had not been conquered, like <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, her restoration to the empire was an achievement of the conqueror whose portrait appeared on the obverse.<ref target="#CH1-n110">

               </ref> If these cannot be considered great art, they are competent designs and pleasant to the eye.</p>
            <pb n="54"/>
            <p>The position of Victory in the later coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> is a minor one. Once he had been granted that honorable name, and the structure of the constitution had been arranged in 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, it was not foreign conquest but internal organization which engrossed his attention and for the success of which his propaganda was employed. Tension with Parthia, which might well have led to war, was composed by diplomacy, and the fortunes of his lieutenants against the Germans were not such as to call for advertisement. Yet as an adjunct, Victory does appear. Spanish mints, beginning about 19 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. portray her with the Clupeus Virtutis (<ref target="#fig-90">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 7</ref>, 8). This is an interesting combination. For one thing, the Clupeus itself stood beneath the statue of Victory in the Senate House;<ref target="#CH1-n111">
                  <hi rend="sup">111</hi>
               </ref> for another the ideas are complementary. The shield had been presented to <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> "virtutis, clementiae, iustitiae et pietatis causa" and it might be understood that it was the victory of <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> which had made those qualities effective in the new age; and, conversely, that it was because of those very qualities that he had been victorious. This is an important point in the theology of our subject. Victory as a gift of the gods had been familiar from the beginning and doubtless it was always assumed that victory would be the reward of those with suitable powers. A mortal might be, like <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, of such surprising power that he could assume that victory would always be his. But that victory should be deserved by moral qualities as well as by might was a new idea, converting a religious concept into an ethical one, very familiar in the lines of <persName>Vergil</persName> and <persName>Horace</persName>.</p>
            <p>Though the types are a successful statement of a novel idea, they certainly cannot be classed as artistic successes. The shield is the central element of the design and it must
<pb n="55"/>
be shown frontally so that its inscription shall make it clear what shield it is. To combine with this circle the figure of the goddess was beyond the skill of the die-sinkers. The type on which she is displaying it like a great tea tray is awkward and a bit ridiculous (<ref target="#fig-90">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 7</ref>), but it is better than the other on which she seems to be diving over it (<ref target="#fig-91">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 8</ref>). The attitude is practically that of the old Nike flying above the victorious chariot, but the new group is hopelessly unconvincing.</p>
            <p>Another case of impossible proportions is more successful. In 13 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> returned from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> after reorganizing the province and apparently in the next year<ref target="#CH1-n112">
                  <hi rend="sup">112</hi>
               </ref> a portrait of him appeared on dupondii of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> with a little Victory tying the laurel wreath on his head (<ref target="#fig-93">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 10</ref>). The disproportion is not greater than on the familiar groups with a seated figure crowned by Nike, but it does not seem to have been well received for it was not repeated and the surviving specimens are few.</p>
            <p>One new Victory belongs to the later years of <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>: one seated on a globe in an attitude that had not been seen since the Nikes of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName>. She occurs on a gold quinarius of 11–10 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (<ref target="#fig-92">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 9</ref>) and may have reference to the campaign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pannonia">Pannonia</placeName> for which official credit went to <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> under whose auspices he fought. She is, as <persName>Sutherland</persName> remarks,<ref target="#CH1-n113">
                  <hi rend="sup">113</hi>
               </ref> a "rare intruder in an otherwise stereotyped series." Other kinds of Victory were used on the gold quinarius: Victory with a trophy,<ref target="#CH1-n114">

                  <hi rend="sup">115</hi>
               </ref> but it was the seated goddess that became the standard type for that denomination.</p>
            <p>One more gold piece deserves special mention (<ref target="#fig-94">

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 10</ref>, 11). Why this should be appropriate to a coin with the legend <placeName corresp="#nomisma_armenia">ARMENIA</placeName> CAPTA is not apparent. It seems that for once the die-sinker was without special instructions—or ignored them—and selected a type to suit his own taste.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 2</ref>) show an invention, not originally numismatic, but destined to have an influence on numismatic design: two statues of Victory, each holding a wreath, on columns to right and left of the altar. So far as this design is the expression of a religious conception it probably means that Victory is thought of as having especially close relations with both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n116">

The period of the Civil Wars, though victory was the price of survival—or perhaps for that very reason—produced few novelties in the idea of victory beyond ephemeral but understandable attempts to attach the goddess to one or another of the contestants, signified by the inscriptions VICTORIA GALBAE AVG,<ref target="#CH1-n120">

which goes back to <persName corresp="#nomisma_agathokles_byzantium">Agathocles</persName> and something to the clupeus virtutis of <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>. Presumably the designer intended to suggest that Victory would end the war (her foot is on a helmet) and result in saving the citizens. But the symbolism cannot be pressed, nor need it be. Orthodoxy was maintained by the inscription VICTORIA AVGVSTI, but in fact, of course, there was no victory.</p>
            <p>One of the most striking aspects of the Roman Imperial Coinage is its memorial and repetitive character. This has its own importance and interest,<ref target="#CH1-n125">
                  <hi rend="sup">125</hi>
               </ref> but it much reduces the proportion of types that have something new to say. In the large repertory of Vespasian most of the Victories are adaptations of earlier types, sometimes quite recent ones. There is an aureus showing Victory 1. crowning the emperor (<ref target="#fig-99">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 6</ref>) which is either a derivative of bronze of <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_ii">Seleucus II</persName> (<ref target="#fig-65">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 5</ref>) or a remarkable coincidence. There is an aureus of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> bearing the Victory on a cista mystica with two serpents which had been used on a quinarius of <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> from the East (<ref target="#fig-100">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 7</ref>). Victory to the left setting a shield on a trophy (<ref target="#fig-101">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 8</ref>) is an obvious echo of the old Victoriatus type (<ref target="#fig-76">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 4</ref>) made novel by reversing the position of the goddess and altering the details.

               </ref> But, for the most part, there is only more or less literal and uninspired copying of well-known types. As time goes on the minor variations multiply, but it would be useless to review them all. There are little changes of adjuncts or of posture and
<pb n="59"/>
combinations of Victory with other figures, but they have nothing to add to the significance of the goddess and the later one gets the less of artistic merit they have to offer.</p>
            <p>There is progressive weakening of the divine person which it is well to note. It is clearly seen in the groups of Victory with a shield. Under <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> the meaning was plain, and Victory was of the utmost importance to him. <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName>' shield with SPQR is not so sharply defined and that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_vitellius">Vitellius</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_vespasian">Vespasian</persName> with OB CIVES SERV still less so. There follow shields more explicit in themselves but more ambiguous as to the goddess. <persName corresp="#nomisma_domitian">Domitian</persName> has a sestertius which shows Victory writing DE GER on a shield.<ref target="#CH1-n128">
                  <hi rend="sup">128</hi>
               </ref> Presumably now the shield is part of the spoils taken from the Germans. But when on a denarius of <persName corresp="#nomisma_trajan">Trajan</persName> Victory writes DA CI CAP,<ref target="#CH1-n129">
                  <hi rend="sup">129</hi>
               </ref> and, on a sestertius, VIC DAC (<ref target="#fig-105">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 3</ref>), one is driven to wonder who the divine scribe is, after all. The conquest of the Dacians is being recorded; is it an immortal and eternal power that is making the record, or is she herself in some sense restricted to this single occasion? The question is still more pointedly put by a sestertius of <persName corresp="#nomisma_commodus">Commodus</persName> where Victory, seated on a pile of arms, holds a stylus with which she is about to inscribe a shield balanced on her left knee. She has as yet written nothing, but below her, where they give every appearance of being her identification, are the words VICT BRIT (<ref target="#fig-106">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 4</ref>). It should be remarked in passing that, influenced perhaps by the Republican didrachm, this seated figure is nude to the waist, a convention that was maintained by seated Victories for generations.</p>
            <p>That the goddess did come in time to have a merely topical significance is proved by an entry in the Feriale Duranum of the third Christian century "ob victorias arabicam et adiabenicam et parthicam maximam—victoriae parthicae,
<pb n="60"/>
bovem feminam."<ref target="#CH1-n130">
                  <hi rend="sup">130</hi>
               </ref> Even earlier than the Feriale there is numismatic proof in the aurei struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_septimius_severus">Septimius Severus</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_caracalla">Caracalla</persName> with the conventional figure with wreath and palm entitled VICTORIA PARTHICA MAXIMA (<ref target="#fig-102">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 9</ref>). The adjective can only refer to the actual physical event and it can hardly be denied that the figure must be a symbol of the same event. Possibly intended as a corrective is the occasional use of the words VICTORIA AETERNA, occurring as late as Diocletian<ref target="#CH1-n131">
                  <hi rend="sup">131</hi>
               </ref>—a phrase of very dubious metaphysical soundness and hardly improved by Constantine's VICTORIAE PERPETVAE.<ref target="#CH1-n132">
                  <hi rend="sup">132</hi>
               </ref> But the development was the other way, and as early as Commodus we find a serious divorce between Victory and her proper function on a sestertius on which the shield is inscribed VO DE, that is VOTIS DECENNALIBVS SVSCEPTIS.<ref target="#CH1-n133">
                  <hi rend="sup">133</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Another fashion of deterioration is that foreshadowed by the Altar of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lugdunum">Lugdunum</placeName>, the types with two Victories. The commonest kind is that where they are simply heraldic supporters of the shield. Valerian shows the simplest form, where the shield is marked S C and the main legend is VOTA ORBIS (<ref target="#fig-104">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 2</ref>). But the normal purpose of the shield comes to be to proclaim the decennial or quinquennial vows offered by the emperor and on his behalf. So Antoniniani of <persName corresp="#nomisma_diocletian">Diocletian</persName> are entirely preoccupied with the imperial date, the shield reading VOT X, while the encircling inscription is PRIMIS X MVLTIS XX.<ref target="#CH1-n134">
                  <hi rend="sup">134</hi>
               </ref> One might urge that as victory was essential to the ten years achieved and the ten to come, the two figures stood for the past and the future, but it seems unlikely that either the die-sinker or the user bothered much
<pb n="61"/>
with subtle explanations. The two Victories were simply available to create a symmetrical pattern, the easiest design to produce and to understand. Sometimes the shield is omitted and the two figures are opposed, either clasping hands<ref target="#CH1-n135">
                  <hi rend="sup">135</hi>
               </ref> or holding wreaths (<ref target="#fig-107">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 5</ref>).<ref target="#CH1-n136">
                  <hi rend="sup">136</hi>
               </ref> The disappearance of personality is complete and can hardly be made more so even by the occasions when the number is raised to three.<ref target="#CH1-n137">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>But these late types do have a new element to contribute which the earlier ones lacked: the presence of the defeated. A denarius of <persName corresp="#nomisma_septimius_severus">Septimius Severus</persName> is typical (<ref target="#fig-108">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 6</ref>): VICT PARTHICAE shows which contest is intended and at the feet of Victory is a little captive. Sometimes there are two captives, sometimes the victim is being trampled by Victory, as on an aureus of <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantius_chlorus">Constantius</persName> II,<ref target="#CH1-n138">
                  <hi rend="sup">138</hi>
               </ref> sometimes dragged away, as on the very common bronzes of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_i">Theodosius I</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_arcadius">Arcadius</persName> (<ref target="#fig-109">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 7</ref>) where the inscription SALVS REIPVBLICAE seeks to give the sanction of the general welfare to a scene that looks like mere brutality. The emperor frequently takes the place of Victory in these scenes and shows what is intended by <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantius_chlorus">Constantius</persName> II when he calls himself DEBELLATOR HOSTIVM or DEBELLATOR GENTIVM BARBARORVM.<ref target="#CH1-n139">
                  <hi rend="sup">139</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>A more pleasing concept is that of Victory guiding the ship of state, either alone, as on the Constantinian bronzes inscribed CONSTANTINOPOLIS (<ref target="#fig-110">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 8</ref>) or with the emperor standing before her, on the bronzes of Constans and <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantius_chlorus">Constantius</persName> II (<ref target="#fig-111">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 1</ref>) of the series inscribed FEL TEMP REPARATIO. This last example shows a com-
<pb n="62"/>
promise of Victory's original pagan character which had not been ostensibly affected by the issues of the first Christian emperor. It is not that she herself is different, but here the emperor holds not only a phoenix, whose significance is ambiguous, but sometimes a labarum instead, the standard with the Christian monogram, whose significance is not. The scene at once becomes one in which the former goddess is reduced to an adjunct of a new deity by whom her nature must be fundamentally affected. From now on, with increasing frequency, she is only the lesser companion of the Christian God.</p>
            <p>Occasionally the late empire made rash experiments with that most dangerous of numismatic designs, the facing portrait. The emperor is sometimes so portrayed—with unhappy results—and a gold piece of <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_i">Constantine</persName> has the figure of Victory, facing, holding the familiar shield (<ref target="#fig-112">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 2</ref>). Another design of <persName corresp="#nomisma_diocletian">Diocletian</persName> shows a Victory flying forward between and above two emperors enthroned to the left (<ref target="#fig-113">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 3</ref>). This is somewhat more attractive. Unfortunately it commended itself to <persName corresp="#nomisma_valentinian_i">Valentinian I</persName> and his family on whose types the little Victory is really absurd (<ref target="#fig-114">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 4</ref>).</p>
            <p>The post-Constantinian period is notable for the great reduction of the number of types used and it is rare that a new idea is added. But there are two phenomena that call for remark. One is the use by <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_i">Theodosius I</persName> of a separate type for his wife <persName corresp="#nomisma_aelia_flacilla">Flacilla</persName>. It was struck in all metals and was borrowed by her daughter-in-law <persName corresp="#nomisma_aelia_eudoxia">Eudoxia</persName> (<ref target="#fig-115">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 5</ref>) the wife of <persName corresp="#nomisma_arcadius">Arcadius</persName>, by her daughter <persName corresp="#nomisma_galla_placidia">Galla Placidia</persName> and by <persName corresp="#nomisma_arcadius">Arcadius</persName>' daughter <persName corresp="#nomisma_aelia_pulcheria">Pulcheria</persName>. It was the old seated Victory with a shield, but in two respects she is new. In the first place she is now fully clothed, though the similar type on the gold semis of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_son_of_mauricius">Theodosius</persName> preserves the tradition of showing her nude to the waist. The other change is much more important, What she is inscribing on the shield is now no votive date
<pb n="63"/>
but the Christian monogram. Victory has, in fact, become an angel.</p>
            <p>The other notable incident is quite as explicit. <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName> began his reign with the gold types familiar to his house. But at the celebration of his vicennalia he introduced a new design: Victory standing to the left and supporting a long cross (<ref target="#fig-116">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 6</ref>). This pious anomaly quickly became popular and for 60 years, until the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_zeno">Zeno</persName> at the end of the century, this was the solidus type par excellence, at first inscribed only with the date VOT XX MVLT XXX, but later bearing the old familiar title VICTORIA AVGG. The types of semis and tri ens also become fixed. The former has Victory seated writing on her shield a date which is not always legible and not always possible when it can be read (<ref target="#fig-117">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 7</ref>). So far as the hasty and careless drawing permits us to judge, she continues the thoroughly outdated tradition of being nude to the waist, but she is converted, for she is accompanied by a little Christogram in the field. On the triens Victory appears to be walking forward, perhaps as a remote modification of the goddess alighting on a globe on <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>' gold. In her right hand she bears the conventional wreath, but in her other is a globus cruciger (<ref target="#fig-120">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 10</ref>). All three Victories are therefore expressly connected with the new religion. The pagan figure does indeed appear once more, on the large bronzes which <persName corresp="#nomisma_zeno">Zeno</persName> struck to have the value of 40 of the miserable minimi which had been all that was left of the bronze currency. She flies to the right with wreath and trophy and is accompanied by the legend INVICT ROMA or GLORIA ROMANORVM (<ref target="#fig-119">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 9</ref>).</p>
            <p>There were two more modifications for the Christianized Victory of the solidus to undergo. One, a minor one, was when <persName corresp="#nomisma_anastasius">Anastasius</persName> substituted a scepter with the Christian monogram for the long cross. The other, a major and a strange one was when on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justin_i">Justin I</persName> the profile figure gives place to a facing one leaning with the right hand
<pb n="64"/>
on a long cross and holding a globus cruciger in the left (<ref target="#fig-118">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 8</ref>). The remarkable thing is that, though the inscription is still VICTORIA AVGG, the figure wears the male attire of tunic and pallium. The ingenuity of <persName>A.A. Vasiliev</persName> and <persName>A.M. Friend</persName> has suggested that the occasion was the religious reunion with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> of 519.<ref target="#CH1-n140">
                  <hi rend="sup">140</hi>
               </ref> Whether or not they are right, the anomaly persists through the reign of Justinian. <persName corresp="#nomisma_justin_i">Justin</persName> II, for whatever reason, though he kept the inscription, replaced the angel with the old figure of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> enthroned. The types of semis and triens were preserved, however, until the accession of <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName> II in 578. He used only a cross for the reverses of his gold and so put an end forever to the last remnant of pagan symbolism on the Roman imperial coinage.</p>

If there is an old Roman element it does not appear in the earliest Roman types. There is, however, abundant evidence that a cult of Victory flourished in the Republic (cf. <persName>Daremberg et Saglio</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire des Antiquités, s.v.</hi> Victoria, pp. 836–839).</p>

               <p>Interesting speculation is aroused by the wording of <persName>Sutherland</persName>'s description, "a representation of the Victory of Samothrace, made famous as a coin type long years before by <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrius Poliorcetes</persName>" (op. cit., pp. 29f.). It is inevitable that <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>' types should recall to <hi rend="italic">us</hi> the earlier type as well as the statue. Specimens and reproductions are available to any numismatist. Were they so readily available in antiquity that a more recent type may be assumed to be a copy or an adaptation of an earlier one? Professor <persName>Raubitschek</persName> asks aptly, "did the emperors have a Cabinet de Médailles?" If not, may the repetition of types, the importance of which <persName>Grant</persName> has emphasized, be taken as proof that the earlier instance was still in circulation at the time the later was issued?</p>

               <p>The theory is presented by <persName>Adolphe Reinach</persName>, "<persName corresp="#nomisma_hicetas">Pyrrhus</persName> et la Niké de Tarente," <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Neapolis</placeName>
                  </hi> I (1913), pp. 19–29. The article is an astonishing piling of one hypothesis upon another. Of its many ingenious suggestions not one will stand scrutiny and we are left with no more evidence than that of <persName>Cassius Dio</persName> and <persName>Herodian</persName> in the passages cited. Yet <persName>H. Bulle</persName> in the article "Nike" (<persName>W. H. Roscher</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie III,</hi>
                  <placeName>Leipzig</placeName>, 1897–1902, cols. 354–356) can conclude that "there can be no doubt that the coins reproduce the Victoria of the Curia." The coins which he cites exhibit four major variations and one might well ask by what criterion he would accept one as original and reject the others as changes. But he regards the fact that the figure is shown to left, to right and facing as certain proof that it had a statuary model (since statues may be viewed from three sides, anything that is viewed from three sides must be a statue), and, once that position is taken, the details can be resolutely dealt with.</p>
