            </head>
            <p>Whenever I have been concerned with the coins of the Roman Republic, I have always found this thought forcing itself on my attentions: With all
               the wealth of material at our disposal, surely it must be possible to discover more about the inner organization of Roman coinage and
               particularly about the <hi rend="italic">triumviri monetales.</hi> Ever since the days of the Renaissance these coins have attracted the
               attention of collectors and students repeatedly. But it was rather the cultural and historical questions which attracted them, especially what
               relationship the coinage had to the history of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> at home and abroad and what historical
               figures might be found among the names of the moneyers. This method of approach is popular even today. <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_49974517">Eckhel</name> was content to deal with the moneyers in a couple of pages (DN, V, 61â65). <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> in his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des rï¿½mischen MÃ¼nzwesens</hi> was the first â the only one, we
               might say â to treat the constitutional aspect of Republican coinage at any length. He began, it is true, with the few passages of literature and
               inscriptions at his disposal and used coins only secondarily. But, for all that, his new arrangement of the material constituted a great advance.
               All later works depend on <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>; <name type="pname">Lenormant</name> openly declared that he
               was following him, and Babelon followed <name type="pname">Lenormant</name>. The same is true of the British Museum Catalogue by <name
                  type="pname">Grueber</name>. In the field of dating Republican coins, great changes have taken place since the second half of the last
               century; but the constitutional questions have either been as good as sidetracked or else solved in the main along the lines of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>.</p>
            <p>In the following study I have attempted to gain an insight into the inner structure of the Republican coinage by a fresh treatment of the coin
               evidence similar to that I have already applied to the third century of the Empire. What is to be said on this point will be found in Section II,
               which deals with the coins. Preceding them, the literary sources are treated in Section I. The conclusions based on these two are given in
               Section III. If my premises are correct, new facts emerge relative to the handling of the coinage under the Roman Republic and to the position of
               the moneyers.</p>

                     rend="italic">viri</hi> in general. No. 1 is discussed below (p. 54). From No. 4 we do learn a fact, confirmed by the coins, that Caesar
                  raised the number of moneyers from three to four. No. 6 will claim our attention later (p. 54f.), as it names a moneyer who struck no coins. I
                  exclude No. 7 from the passages relating to moneyers, for I follow the view of Drumann-Groebe <pb n="8"/> (V. 531) that it concerns a

               </head>
               <p>No less scanty is the evidence from the inscriptions, numerous though they are. Strasburger, in his article, "Triumviri" in RE, lists
                  sixty-three in Latin: to these we may add XI. 5171, XIV. 3609 and Dessau 8979.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> The inscription, XIV. 4245, quoted
                  by <name type="pname">Groag</name> in the Arch. epigr. Mitt. 19, is doubtful. There is also the <hi rend="italic">elogium</hi> XXXIII, CIL
                     I.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> 200. Greek inscriptions number six, two of which are quoted by Magie in the article in RE cited above. From
                  all these inscriptions we only learn something about the title and the <hi rend="italic">cursus honorum.</hi> The usual title is IIIVIR AAAFF
                  or IIIVIR Monetalis AAAFF. It occurs about fifty times. Twice (XIV. 3592 and 3593) the AAAFF is missing. Exceptionally, there appears IIIVIR
                  AD MONETAM (II, 4609), XXVIR MONETALIS (XIV. 3609) and IIIVIR MONETARVM (Dessau 8979). The following inscriptions are imperfect : In III, 87
                  and XIV. 14148<hi rend="sup">10</hi> IIIVIR AVR ARG FLANDO, AERE and FERIVNDO has been omitted; in VIII. 23831 and XIV. 4240, one A has
                  dropped out (AAFF); in VI. 1455â6. on the other hand, both inscriptions of the same man, a third F has been mistakenly added (AAAFFF). All
                  these are simply errors on the part of the stone-mason or his model, and it is superfluous to draw any conclusion from them.</p>
               <p>In about half the inscriptions the <hi rend="italic">cursus honorum</hi> is found in the descending order, with the vigintivirate mentioned
                  near the end. In the remaining half, the <hi rend="italic">cursus honorum</hi> is found in the ascending order from the lower offices to the
                  higher. The order is occasionally disturbed, as in XIV. 3609. The <hi rend="italic">elogium</hi> gives Q IIIVIR AAAFF AED CVR etc. â that is
                  to say, Pulcher is called first quaestor and then moneyer. Whether this has any constitutional meaning or is only a mistake in writing may be
                  left unsettled.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> On principle I draw no conclusions from isolated instances. Perhaps the inscriptions might yield
                  more information, if we submitted their peculiarities to a close scrutiny and comparison. <name type="pname">Groag</name>, for example, by

                  that all patricians of the vigintivirate held only the office of moneyer (AEM 19, 145f).</p>
               <p>Inasmuch as almost all these inscriptions come from the Empire (they extend into the middle of the third century) their value for the Republic
                  is limited. But they do show that the office was still in existence down to that date. See also below, p.66.</p>

               <p>We do not have the text of any, but Pliny gives us the contents of three. He writes (N. H. XXXIII. 13): "Postea Hannibale urgente, <name
                     type="pname">Q. Fabio</name> Maximo dictatore asses unciales facti placuitque denarium sedecim assibus permutari, quinarium octonis,

                  Clodia percussus est." All the dates in Chapter XXXIII are confused and different periods are mixed up with one another. Recent research by
                     <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> and others has brought this out clearly. Hence, it is now established that the so-called Lex Flaminia
                  or <name type="pname">Fabia</name> â that is, the uncial standard and the retariffing of the denarius at 16 Asses â belong to the age of the
                  Gracchi. The Lex <name type="place">Papiria</name> is placed with some certainty at 89 B.C.; I have widened its scope by means of new
                  observations (p. 32). Thus, the "mox" in Pliny, otherwise unintelligible, becomes understandable. The date of the Lex Clodia, which perhaps
                  did contain further prescriptions, is certainly ca. 104 B.C. (p. 28).</p>

               <p>The coin evidence which is pertinent to our research is found fairly complete in <name type="pname">Mommsen's</name> MW, Babelon and the BMC.
                  Indispensable, however, are the three supplements of <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name>, who has tracked down and faithfully tested almost
                  every piece. Corrections by <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> are not always expressly mentioned here, but they are often tacitly adopted.
                  Therefore in checking my material, comparison must be made with <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> who has also many important additions.<ref

               <p>Of course the attempt has long since been made to provide a chronological order for the great mass of Republican coinage in addition to the
                  alphabetical arrangement by families which is so convenient, but so completely unscientific. To this end, various approaches have been tried â
                  studies of persons, dates fixed by historical characters or by laws of known date, results of metrology (weights, denominations), finds,
                  style, development of types.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref>

               <p>

                     corresp="#wikidata_Q2262449">Fulvio Orsini</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> It has been a fascinating game â identifying persons
                  mentioned in history with the names on the Republican coins â fascinating, but dangerous. There is nothing to tell us whether likeness of name
                  justifies identification, especially if we consider how little variety prevails in the Roman names of the Republic. One has only to study the
                  list of "gentes" in MW 864ff. to see how often a whole series of members of the same families, especially of the great ones, occurs on coins,
                  â to say nothing of the literary sources â the Aurelii, Caecilii, Calpurnii, Cornelii, Furii, Julii, Junii, Licinii, Marcii, Plautii,
                  Pomponii, Porcii, Servilii, Valerii. This method of study, which Kirchner (ZfN, 1898, 74ff.), <name type="pname">Sundwall</name> and Head have
                  also applied to the Athenian Tetradrachms of the New Style, is still popular and has been especially exploited by <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, Babelon and the BMC. A comparison of the statements of the last three cited authors shows how
                  vague all these attributions are. In my catalogue, the dates of Babelon and the BMC can be readily compared for each moneyer, inasmuch as I
                  have placed them in each case at the beginning. Often, it is true, such identifications are well supported; often fixed dates do exist which
                  are subsequently questioned. To take one example, Sydenham has quite recently criticized the date of Piso-Caepio, which used to be considered
                  basic, and I think that he is right (see p. 29). The laws in question give equally scanty results, as they can usually only be dated
                  approximately.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Metrological Data</hi>. The case is, if anything, worse with the data supplied by metrology. Generally speaking it is
                  admitted that in the case of <hi rend="italic">al marco</hi> coinage, that is to say, when a given number of coins has to be produced out of a
                  given weight of metal, without regard to the weight of the individual coin, the single specimen can only be used with the greatest caution.
                  Such a system was in general use in antiquity. There are also divergent theories<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> about the determination of the
                  average weight. Furthermore, the number of surviving specimens is often very small and their preservation poor. No wonder, then, that, with
                  the foundations so shaky, the view of experts differ widely. Theories begin at once to diverge over the determination of the standards of the
                  "Aes Grave". Semi-Libral, triental and quadrantal standards are contested. To realize this, one has only to consult the authorities in
                  question â <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, the BMC, Haeberlin, Sydenham and Giesecke.<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The most reasonable view seems to be that the gradual decline in weight happened <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>, as is natural in the
                  development of coinage and that this gradual decline was subsequently regularized by law. The only literary information that we have (in
                  Pliny) concerns the sextantal, uncial and semiuncial standards, which has to be interpreted first of all. Today, the sextantal standard is
                  generally considered to have begun with the denarius at the end of the third century; the uncial standard comes in during the age of the
                  Gracchi; the semiuncial was introduced by the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name> of 89 B.C.</p>
               <p>Hence it is impossible to be too careful in the use of standards for the determination of chronology. <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name>
                  himself, who lays such stress on weights, writes (SBf, p. 89): "Bei der verhï¿½ltnismï¿½ï¿½igen Gleichgiltigkeit, welche man in betreff der
                  Fehlergrenze im Gewicht der einzelnen MÃ¼nzen hat, ist es daher bei diesen MÃ¼nzen auch oft unmï¿½glich anzugeben, welchem Fuï¿½ das einzelne Stï¿½ck
                  angehï¿½rt. Durchschnittsgewichte sind dafÃ¼r meist ohne Bedeutung und kï¿½nnen nur in wenigen Fï¿½llen herangezogen werden."</p>
               <p>At this point I will treat a difficulty which <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> has discovered in the so-called "heavy" and "light" series
                  of Aes. Again and again, in dealing with individual moneyers, he refers to this unexplained peculiarity. He has recorded the following series

               <p>Here, too, belongs <name type="pname">L. Pompon</name>. Molo (p. 158) with two series from As to Sextans â the heavy 36â26, the light 17â14 â
                  that is to say, sextantal to uncial. But inasmuch as there are only five specimens in the light series against 151 in the main series, which
                  is the heavy one, the so-called "light" series may be regarded as mistakes in weight and, as such, neglibible. Perhaps, I should also quote
                     <name type="pname">M. Cipius M. F.</name> (p. 110) with a new reverse, and C. Numitorius (Bf I. 26), Triens and Quadrans with C.NVM.</p>
               <p>Light and heavy series are generally related to one another, it will be seen, in the proportion of 1 to 2 or a little more. But it must be
                  observed that between these limits, every intermediate stage occurs so that the division into two series becomes doubtful. These differences
                  also occur in other series e.g. <graphic url="NS7_sym17.jpg"/>, (SBf 121), where the As weighs from 52.51 to 27.35, and <name type="pname"
                     >Bahrfeldt</name> has not assumed two series here (cp. Catalogue, no. 13). With its stereotyped portraits, there is no certainty to be had
                  from differences of style of the Aes.</p>
               <p>In the series just quoted from <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name>, it will at once strike the reader that the quadrans is almost without
                  exception cited. This denomination, as our Catalogue will show, was certainly the commonest of all, occurring in almost every series of Aes,
                  and often by itself. When the output was so large and protracted, it is no wonder that weights should vary. Therefore it is most reasonable to
                  abandon the theory of two distinct series. <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> himself could not discover any reasonable explanation in
                  support of his hypothesis.</p>
               <p>A parallel to these series of Aes is supplied by the so-called heavy and light denarii of the first period, were the distinction is just as
                  weakly founded. <name type="pname">Samwer-Bahrfeldt</name> has used them to establish the chronological order of the earliest group of denarii
                  with symbol (see below, Group I). <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> (JRS, 1929, 31) rightly observes: "When we turn to the coins, we find it
                  hard to trace any clear line between sextantal and uncial bronze and between heavy and light denarii. To judge from them, there was no sudden
                  change of standard either in silver or in bronze, but a gradual decline â which need not have been prescribed by any law. Within groups of
                  coins in both metals, very closely related in style, we find serious variations in weight. To make weight a main criterion and to class all
                  the heavy denarii as early, all the light ones as late, would make havoc of any arrangement. In finds, too, there is no clear distinction
                  between sextantal and uncial bronze and heavy and light denarii." But all these observations go back only to weights, which are certainly very
                  relative. So <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> rightly continues: "From the coins we have inferred a change from a denarius of four to one
                  of three and a half scrapes and have associated the reduction more or less closely with the change from sextantal to uncial standard in
                  bronze." And again he remarks, on p. 33: "Both in silver and in bronze there was a steady decline in weight towards a three and half scruple
                  and an uncial standard for denarius and As respectively: but this was dictated by stress of necessity â not by any law." <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> (MW, 384) in his day had already made the same observation (Cp. p. 296, on the reduction to one
                  eighty-fourth of a pound, as established by weights): "Nach den jetzt vorliegenden, wenig zahlreichen Wï¿½gungen, lï¿½ï¿½t sich nicht mit vï¿½lliger
                  Sicherheit entscheiden, ob sie (die Reduktion) gesetzlich, oder, wie wahrscheinlicher, allmï¿½hlich stattfand, und welches die Sorten sind, die
                  der ï¿½lteren Wï¿½hrung folgen."</p>
               <p>Therefore I have not taken into consideration the distinction between the heavy and light denarius in Group 2.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Finds.</hi> There is no need to waste words on the importance of finds, but we should take to heart what Regling says (SWM
                  416) about their use. As a general rule, finds nan be dated by their so-called "key" coins â pieces capable of receiving an exact date. But
                  the reverse process, the dating of coins by finds, is far more difficult and demands very great caution. The relative sequence can usually
                  only be established, when a sufficient number of hoards is available, and then the <hi rend="italic">argumentum ex silentio</hi> plays its
                  part. <name type="pname">Mattingly</name>, for example, in his article on the "Serrati" (NChr. 1924) has pointed out the incorrect use made of
                  finds in the BMC and has redated many of the finds. Sydenham in NChr. 1940 has also made some comments that deserve full attention, and he has
                  set a good example in his table of finds for the age of Piso-Caepio. A new list for all finds of Republican coins should be drawn up with it
                  as a model. It must further be noted that finds have often been falsified (cp. for example, BMC I. 395n. I) or even invented. <name
                     type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> has given many pertinent examples in his <hi rend="italic">Addenda</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic">Gold
                     Coinage.</hi> For the Greek field Gaebler has recorded a series of interesting example in his valuable articles on Macedonian coin
                  forgeries in the <hi rend="italic">Sitzungs-berichte der preuï¿½. Akademie der Wissenschaften.</hi> The argument <hi rend="italic">ex
                     silentio</hi> can also be corrected occasionally by later finds, e.g., the find of Cajazzo supplies the hitherto missing gold of <name
                     type="pname">P. Clodius</name> and <name type="pname">C. Vibius Varus</name> (BMC. I. 555). On the whole question, see <name type="pname"
                     >Mattingly</name> (RC. 42f.) with his supplementary list of hoards published in the meantime.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> (MW) made full use of hoards and the BMC even in greater degree â subject, however,
                  to the qualification observed above. <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> refers quite often to finds, especially in his <hi rend="italic"
                     >Rï¿½miche Goldmï¿½nzenprï¿½gung.</hi> In my Catalogue I have not checked the finds, for this would exceed the limits of this essay. However, for
                  a final arrangement, a new examination of this nature will be absolutely necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Types and Style</hi>. The development of the types supplies a good guide for the relative chronology. It can be followed in
                  BMC I LXXXIV or in one of the works cited at the beginning. First comes the stereotyped representation of the head of Bellona<ref
                     target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> and of the Dioscuri; then nome the deities in chariots, which <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> assigns to the
                  age of the Gracchi; then follow historical reminiscences referring to the moneyers; finally references to contemporary events which give only
                  a <hi rend="italic">terminus a quo</hi>, for the immediate use of a type after an event can hardly be proved. A much more dangerous attempt is
                  the interpretation made from distinctions of style, for a large subjective element comes into play here. Long practice, a certain intuition
                  and a very sober judgement are essential. De Salis, the real authority behind the BMC, often let himself be led too far by his sense of style.
                  And this brings us to a vital question â that of the <hi rend="italic">local Italian issues</hi>.</p>
               <p>The older school, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, in particular, assigns only the first coinage of the Aes down to
                  the Second Punic War to mints outside <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> (MW 371f). We find the names of mints on some of
                  these Aes and on the victoriates. Apart from this, Roman coins, not produced in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>, are
                  confined to the coinage of the generals. The idea of attributing a large number of denarii, with moneyer's names, to local mints in <name
                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> derives from De Salis, who was influenced by impressions of style. Chronological
                  difficulties, as <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> (RC 145) points out, are not found in the purely Roman series. How unconvincing these
                  distinctions of style are, may be seen from a glance at the Plates in the BMC. Generally <pb n="14"/> speaking the coarser work is transferred
                  to the provinces. To realize the fallibility of this argument, simply compare the Roman issues of 102â92 B.C. on Pl. XXIX with the supposedly
                  rougher Italian issues of the same period on Pl. XCIII. This one example will prove sufficient.</p>
               <p>Serious constitutional difficulties also come into consideration. The office of moneyer was a city office in common with the rest of the <hi
                     rend="italic">cursus honorum,</hi> with the exception of the provincial quaestors of later institution. But these quaestors were financial
                  assistants of the military general. That their special function was necessarily first of all of a distinct nature, is quite understandable
                  because of the Roman tendency to separate financial administration from military administration (cp. below p. 58). On the other hand, it is
                  quite inconceivable that moneyers appointed as the Roman ones and performing their functions should wander about the countryside working now
                  in this mint and now in that. Even the BMC (II. 143) observes: "These local moneyers seem to have been chosen from the same class as those
                  employed in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>, for the types of their coins show that most of them were members of the
                  most celebrated Roman families. In some cases they may have been moneyers who held office at the mint in the Capitol." The mint of <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> was sufficient for the civil requirements in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> even during the major part of the Empire, inasmuch as communications were good and easy. However,
                  the generals enjoyed the right to strike coins for the purposes of war. Hence, I do not accept local issues of denarii in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> at the time of the Republic.</p>
               <p>Because of the above considerations I have been obliged to create a new arrangement, which of course has not forced us to go into every
                  detail. In this matter I have been guided by the principles which I set down in my "Aufbau der rï¿½mischen MÃ¼nzprï¿½gung in der Kaiserzeit" (NZ
                  1933â1936). I believe this new system has proved its worth in other works too, for example, in Elmer's "MÃ¼nzprï¿½gung der gallischen Kaiser" <hi
                     rend="italic">(Bonner Jahrbï¿½cher,</hi> 1940) and in Delbrueck's <hi rend="italic">Die MÃ¼nzblidnisse von Maximinus bis Carinus</hi> (1944).
                  It has received recognition from Le Gentilhomme (RN 1942, p. 5) and from <name type="pname">Mattingly</name>, who assured me by letter, that
                  he is now using my system in his continuation of the catalogue of Coins in the British Museum. The principal idea is quite simple. Every
                  official coinage must be rigorously arranged and controlled, otherwise the financial administration will collapse. History gives us enough
                  examples of this. These principles must have prevailed at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> all the more, for at <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> especially there was prevalent a most precise and an exact organization which suited the
                  psychology of a peasant nation. Moreover, this order is capable of being discovered in the coins at our disposal, if we arrange systematically
                  and investigate the great masses of common pieces. All exceptional and special issues, on the other hand, must be put to one side and be added
                  subsequently after the main structure is complete. This method has yielded good results for the imperial issues of 192â253 A.D. With
                  Republican coins conditions are of course different. Here we are without dated pieces and the key-coins, which are determined by COS, TRIB POT
                  and other indications of date. Hence I was obliged to search for other aids. The chief idea has been that everything which proceeds from the
                  highest financial authority, i.e. from the quaestor, is strictly speaking a directive for the coinage. To the quaestor belongs above all the
                  fixing of the standard, especially for the Aes, as far as we know and the kinds of denominations which are issued from time to time, as well
                  as the choice of marks of value and marks of control. The rise <pb n="15"/> and decline of denominations rest upon ordinances of this nature.
                  They vary from the complete issue of every subdivision to that of single denominations and vice versa. Often the next group continues the
                  order of denominations and then changes gradually.</p>
               <p>A system must be hidden in all these arrangements; they cannot proceed in blind confusion. It may be added that, in view of that obstinate
                  adherence to plans once made, which is proper to the Roman character, any new reform was retained in its exact form, for a time at least. For
                  example, the issues marked with <hi rend="bold">X</hi> form a closed series, as well as those marked with <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> or
                  issue marks.</p>
               <p>Two principles that I have established have proved most helpful: first, that of the supplementary issues, like the supplementary denarii that
                  I have already traced under the Empire; second, that of the role of the leading moneyer. The special issues, recognizable by a special
                  formula, are always to be separated from the regular. These principles together give us an adequate degree of certainty for a relative
                  chronology and especially for the structure of the monetary system. There are also minor observations which in a secondary fashion contribute
                  to an inderstanding of the Republican coinage â fixed dates for known officers, usually in the special coinages, the introduction of
                  particular types, the legal provisions and other observations.</p>
               <p>Important, also, is the sequence of the metals as they make their appearance in the development of Roman coinage. Aes was issued first in
                  contrast to the Greek monetary domain. After a short interval of about twenty years came the Romano-Campanian silver and then the national
                  denarius (cp. p. 50). Gold is always a money of necessity, as with the Greek Republics. The more the Republican principle is threatened, the
                  more frequent do the issues of gold become. Sulla, Pompey, and finally Caesar's rich output of gold give evidence of the trend. The IIIviri
                  RPC in their turn struck gold irregularly in their capacity as generals. The imperial issues of gold begin with Augustus.</p>
               <p>All these principles of arrangement are given in the introduction to each group and also often for the individual moneyers. They can be
                  examined there. In order to establish these principles, I was obliged to begin by arranging the fullest, i.e., the latest groups and to work
                  back from them to the earlier and simpler ones. In this paper, however, the natural course of chronological development is demonstrated.
                  Results of a general character which had been reached in the study of later groups have been applied to the earlier ones.</p>
               <p>On this basis, I believe I have succeeded in establishing a new and firmer order. I would emphasize, however, that this order is in no way
                  final. The finds must be approached systematically as well as the other criteria, which have been mentioned above, in order to establish an
                  exact system. But in my opinion the main features, the general arrangement and especially the sequence of issues are certain. Within the
                  groups themselves individual moneyers or colleges of triumviri may be moved or exchanged, but the groups themselves are fixed beyond
                  question.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">B. The Catalogue</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The Catalogue contains ten groups, the first of which is presented only in summary form, inasmuch as it makes no contribution to our research.
                  The single colleges of triumviri are numbered not only within the groups but also consecutively. The special issues are cited under the number
                  of the regular series to which they belong. The year given in BMC stands at the beginning of each issue. Where BMC gives a period, e.g.
                  217â197 B.C., for the sake of simplicity I give the initial date only, e.g. 217. Then, after a diagonal (/), there comes the date given by
                  Babelon. In Group 10 only, the date after the diagonal is the date found in the RIC. Next comes the name of the moneyer, as it appears on the
                  coin; but variations of name are only occasionally cited. The gentile name is added in brackets in cases where it is not already obvious. Next
                  follows a very short description of the piece, with the date on the obverse which is important to us,<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> then the
                  reverse type, followed by the details of the reverse. Then come the denominations. Denominations, which have not yet been found but which may
                  be assumed, have been placed in square bracked. I have introduced such presumptive pieces most successfully into my <hi rend="italic"
                     >Aufbau.</hi> Of course sound reasons must exist for this. Very often the postulated coin has subsequently come to light. Uncertain
                  denominations carry a question mark. After the introduction of issue marks in Group 5, and because of the increase in the number of reverse
                  types, I have substituted the issue marks for details on types. Later, when the marks are lacking, I have used a dash. What precedes the dash
                  belongs to the obverse, what follow,, to the reverse. The regular coinage is arranged in accordance with the colleges of triumviri (sometimes
                  named after their series). The individual issues are recorded only in the special coinages. The output of coin by an individual moneyer is
                  called an <hi rend="italic">issue</hi>. Following Sundwall's example the moneyers of a college are marked M<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, M<hi
                     rend="sup">2</hi>, and M<hi rend="sup">3</hi>. Epigraphical variants or minor changes in name are not generally noted. For these variations
                  the BMC Introduction I, pp. cii ff. may be consulted.</p>
               <p>I have refrained deliberately from an exact chronology for which the supplementary research of which I have spoken would be necessary; even
                  then, much would remain hypothetical. For my purpose such exactness is not necessary. In the chapter about the introduction of the moneyers
                  (III A) I have placed the beginning of the coinage of denarii in the last third of the Second Punic War. It ends in 7 B.C., as may be seen
                  from Group 10. Fixed dates for particular coinages seldom occur, except in special issues. I give at this point a general survey of the
                  relative chronolgy. The details can be found in the Group listings. Group 1 consists of the anonymous denarii and the denarii with symbols.
                  Then follows Group 2, with the first names â first, with one name abbreviated, then with the first name in full, secondly, with two names, and
                  finally with three (IâII, 210â168 B.C.). The special denominations quinarius, victoriate and As stop in Group 3. The bronze are at first very
                  scarce, but they gradually become more plentiful (168â119 B.C.). Group 4 begins <pb n="17"/> with the foundation of Narbo in 118 B.C. and ends
                  with the Lex Clodia of ca. 104 B.C. The new denarius symbol is characteristic of this group. Group 5, with the issue marks, extends from ca.
                  104 B.C. to the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name> of 89 B.C. Group 6 comes next and extends to ca. 81 B.C.
                  Group 7 is dated very roughly at 80â70 B.C. There is a regular issue and a special issue which runs parallel. The beginning of Group 8 is
                  dated approximately at 70 B.C. by means of the special issue of the aediles, Galba and Plaetorius; it extends to ca. 50 B.C. Groups 9 and 10
                  can be closely dated: Group 9 at 49â41 B.C., Group 10 at 20â7 B.C.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A small group without symbols precedes this group. It is unimportant for our purposes. <name type="pname">Samwer-Bahrfeldt</name> makes it
                     contemporary with ours. But our group itself can be determined only approximately.</p>
                  <p>The symbol have been regarded, probably correctly, as badges of the coining officials. Such symbol had already been customary in <name
                        type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name>. They are found in the sixth and fifth centuries in Abdera, in the fourth and third
                     at Corinth. Best known of all are the badges of the moneyers of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> from 229 B.C.
                     These appear together with the names of the moneyers. This parallelism is not surprising because of the Athenian influence upon the first
                     silver issue at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>.</p>
                  <p>Even in this group it should be possible to establish colleges of triumviri, but the groundwork has not yet been established. <name
                        type="pname">Samwer-Bahrfeldt</name> have dealt with these earliest issues and have divided them, on grounds of metrology, into three
                     sections â heavy silver and sextantal Aes, light silver and sextantal Aes, light silver and uncial Aes.. But these divisions, as I have
                     Already shown (p. 11f.) are quite uncertain. What may be gathered from their arguments is that silver was at first issued in mass, just
                     because it was new. The first section contains eight issues of gold and silver and nineteen of denarii and bronze, i.e. twenty-seven issues
                     of nine colleges of triumviri or, perhaps, eight colleges of triumviri, with one issue of gold and silver and two of denarii and bronze,
                     and one pure silver series. Pure issues of bronze appear only in sections 2 and 3. They comprise thirty-nine issues, thirteen colleges of
                     triumviri â four in silver, three in denarii and bronze, five in bronze and one mixed. There are also many special issues, of which I have
                     taken no account. There are also other combinations which might be considered. In the issue with the wheel, we meet for the first time the
                        <hi rend="italic">serratus</hi>, but it is an isolated phenomenon, alternating with the ordinary denarii. For our research this group
                     yields no profit.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>In complete agreement with the Athenian model (p. 51), the names of the moneyers first appear as monograms, Then are abbreviated and
                     finally are written out in full. This observation gives us then a principle of arrangement for the group. Of course the development does
                     not proceed with mathematical exactness. First one or mors letters were set down as if by way of experiment; then a name, usually the <hi
                        rend="italic">cognomen;</hi> afterwards the abbreviated <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi> was added. At the end of the group we find
                     three names. Even in the <pb n="18"/> later groups, there are relapses towards the first system; but, generally speaking, the rise from
                     simple to more complex can be clearly traced. It goes without saying that the denarius because of its small size continues to prefer the
                     shorter forms. In this group separate colleges of triumviri can already be clearly distinguished, e.g., no. 3 with 3 quinarii, no. 6 with 3
                     victoriates, no. 8 with Diana in biga no. 10 and no. 17 with Victory in biga and the last college of triumviri with three names and the <hi
                        rend="italic">cognomen</hi> in each case on the obverse. In the composition of the other colleges the rules, which were mentioned at the
                     beginning, are of value. In the sub-groups I and II, every denarii and bronze series is followed by a supplementary series in bronze, for
                     the use of bronze is still predominant. In the third sub-group with more than one name in the legend, each denarius series alternates at
                     first with a bronze series; towards the end only denarii and bronze series are issued and continue in this fashion into the next group.
                     Therefore, for nos. 1â15 a change of coinage must be assumed for each year (p. 61, no. 29) inasmuch as the division into heavy and light
                     denarii has been neglected for the silver coinage (p. 13). The denarii which <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> designated <hi
                        rend="italic">heavy</hi> are marked with an asterisk. Now and then victoriates and quinarii also appear while the denominations of
                     bronze seem to go down to the uncial. But the extent of any particular issue is hard to determine in the present state of the coin
                     evidence. The common phenomenon of supplementary denominations, which continues into the third century of the Empire finds here its first
                     obvious expression in a supplementary denarii series (no. 5) and an issue of denarii and quinarii of Tampilus. The Dioscuri are depicted on
                     the reverse type for the most part, but soon the biga appears, first driven by Diana as the national goddess, then by Victory. Thus three
                     sub-groups exist: (1) with monograms, (2) with single names, (3) with two or three names. The distribution of the moneyers into the
                     separate colleges, is in no way definitive, as was noticed in the beginning. I have often collected into one eries issues with the same
                     moneyer's name, which other writers have separated. Besides, so general agreement prevails in regard to the reading of the monograms.</p>
                  <p>I. With monograms. There is always a denarii and bronze series with one in bronze every two years. A supplementary college of III viri for
                     denarii and a supplementary issue of denarii and quinarii occurs for the first time.</p>
                  <p>1. In accordance with earlier practice, monogram plus symbol, Q and <graphic url="NS7_sym27.jpg"/> in the Aes are interpreted as names of
                     cities. In the denarii and bronze series the denominations of Aes are still imperfect.</p>

                  <p>2. In the denarii and bronze we find the first attempt to add a <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi> and a single letter to the monogram. One
                     college of triumviri is obvious, because of its denarii and quinarii with the monogram on its side twice out of three times. <name

                     <p>A typical example of the uncertainty of weights. According to <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name>, III, 158, the Asses give an average
                        of 25.85, while the Sextantes give 36.12. The Case is similar with the allied series with the hammer.</p>

                  <head>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Group Down to</hi> 119 B.C. <hi rend="smallcaps">as Is Shown by the Initial, Date of Group</hi> 4</head>
                  <p>The absence of victoriates and quinarii in silver and the absence of the As in bronze are the outstanding characteristics of this group.
                     The quadrans is the only denomination of Aes to appear regularly (cp. p. 12). Gradually the other values art added, first Semis, then
                     Triens, finally Sextans and Urcia. This gives us a principle of arrangement. That the <pb n="21"/> ascending order is correct is proved by
                     the fact that the last issue, with the Semis-Uncia series complete, is linked to the initial series of the fourth group, which then grows
                     gradually thinner in diminishing order. Evidently at the beginning of our group there were still enough bronze available, so that all needs
                     could at first be met by the most important denomination, the quadrans. Then the ever increasing lack of bronze produced a larger
                     issue.</p>
                  <p>The extent of the Aes coinage is indeed very uncertain, as may be seen from <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt's</name> exact observations and
                        <hi rend="italic">Corrigenda.</hi> The present state of our material, which generally speaking is very scanty, justifies our
                     arrangement. But if finds should contribute new material, changes must be made even in the case given. In regard to the separate colleges
                     of triumviri, we do find with the exception of the last series that the leading moneyer also strikes bronze, while his two colleagues have
                     denarii only. To this group belong all the remaining denarii with X, for this sign is replaced by <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> in the
                     next group. For this reason it was necessary to transfer to this group as late an issue as that of Aquillius.</p>
                  <p>The revaluation of the denarii at sixteen Asses also takes place at this period. It has been placed by recent students in the age of the
                     Gracchi, by Sydenham in the days of the Elder, by <name type="pname">Mattingly</name>, with more probability in the time of the Younger
                     (cp. also no. 29 n. 20, below, on the "Appeal" scene). The new designation of value, XVI, appears on two series; then, if my arrangement is
                     accepted, gives place again for a short time to the old and is finally replaced by <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/>, as Kubtischek has
                     correctly observed (cp. Group 4).</p>
                  <p>Order still prevails in the determination of the denominations and marks of value. In this we still recognize the strictly official control
                     of the quaestor. However, in the choice of types much looseness begins to appear. This has already been stated in BMC I. 126, infra: ".....
                     At this time so many changes were taking place, not only in the types, but also in the moneyers' names and their positions, and even in the
                     mark of value." In this respect the moneyers were given a free hand, which appears from their choice of mint symbols, which are not always
                     family badges, but may have direct reference to the moneyers themselves. At first this change concerns only the reverse, on which the
                     Dioscuri are more and more pushed aside by deities in chariots and finally disappear. Twice reverses of the Romano-Campanian Age are
                     repeated, namely, the Oath-Scene and the she-wolf and twins. Towards the end of this group we meet with an <hi rend="italic">appeal</hi>
                     scene and a monument. For the first time one moneyer strikes two types; later, there are as many as ten or more. The obverse also under
                     goes a change, but only as a first attempt, for the head of Bellona still ranked as a sacred symbol First the head was turned to the left;
                     then, only once, replaced by a head of Sol. Other innovations were the placing of the name of ROMA on the obverse and of the mark of value
                     on the reverse. The revolution extended even to the unchanging bronze. Under the triumvirate of Domitius, Silanus and Curtius, No. 30, with
                     the attributes of the deities, whose heads appear on the obverse, were used as the type of the reverse. In this triumvirate the leading
                     moneyer distinguished himself from M<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">3</hi> by striking alone. Here also for the first time a
                     substitute has been appointed in the college of triumviri, no. 27, which issued a second series. His predecessor had disappeared either for
                     natural or political reasons. Later such an occurrence happens frequently. Finally the first special coinage of a quaestor with EX SC<ref
                        target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> belongs to this group. The stirring times are reflected in the coinage, and the gradual dissolution of
                     Republican forms can be traced in it.</p>
                  <pb n="22"/>
                  <p>Some colleges of triumviri clearly emerge, for example, no. 23, with ROMA and the <hi rend="italic">cognomen</hi> of the obverse and the
                     first quadrigae â a simultaneous support for the order denarii and bronze plus denarii. Then there are the two series with XVI, nos. 27A
                     and 28 and the preceding one, no. 27, with two of the moneyers of no. 27A. Finally in no. 30, all three moneyers appear for the first time
                     on one coin.</p>
                  <p>I. With Quadrans alone.</p>

                  <p>The decisive criteria of arrangement are the following. The new sign, <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/>, is regularly used except in the first
                     college of triumviri. At first Because of the contact with Group 3, the denominations are still plentiful, but the As continues to be
                     missing. Gradually the denominations become scarcer. In the beginning we find, as at the end of Group 3, there are always three denarii and
                     bronze series with two pure series of supplementary denarii, and then appear one denarius and Bronze plus two denarii. The first sub-group
                     goes from Semis downwards, the second from Triens, the third from Quadrans, but the present state of our material always has to be taken
                     into consideration. In this group, too, the Quadrans is also regular. The occasional special coinage of the Dodrans and Bes is surprising.
                     On the reverse we meet the old type of the Dioscuri for the last time; otherwise, deities in chariots are common, whilst new reverses
                     become increasingly plentiful. The leading moneyer often has Jupiter in a quadriga. Towards the end of this group the legend ROMA is
                     occasionally missing from the denarius; in the next group it disappear entirely. On the other hand, the first issue marks are foreshadowrd
                     in the issue of <name type="pname">C. Sereveilius</name>, no. 37. There are three obvious colleges of triumviri, nos. 37, 39 and 40. A
                     supplementary issue to no. 37 is indicated by the dodrans and bes, which can hardly be detached from No. 37 although they are peculiar.
                     Here again, one moneyer must have dropped out:.</p>
                  <p>The initial coinage of L LIC and CN DOM is important. I follow the views of Kubitschek (<hi rend="italic">Studien</hi>, 57ff.), who first
                     discussed the question and of <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> (NChr. 1924, p. 45), who associated the issue of this denarius with the
                     foundation of Narbo.<ref target="#CH2-n21a">21a</ref>
                     <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> sees in the two names the IIVIRI COL DED. The only record we have is that they were censors together in
                     92 B.C. But censors have nothing to do with coinage. But there is no objection <pb n="25"/> to supposing with Kubitschek that they had
                     already held an office together,<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> especially an extraordinary office like that of the IIVIRI COL DED. All
                     that we know is that Licinius was entrusted with the dedication of the colony. But generally speaking there were two or three
                     Commissioners, and Cn. Domitius was about the same age as Licinius. Licinius was born in 140 B.C., was TRIB PLEB in 107, and Domitius was
                     TRIB PLEB in 104. Hence there is no objection to their having been colleagues in this post. The old date 92 B.C., has been rejected
                     decisively by <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> (RC 43). The whole earlier development also makes this date improbable. <name
                        type="pname">Mattingly</name> believes that the moneyers who use <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> were quaestors, yet the sign Q is
                     missing. In any case the denarii were supplementary and form a kind of special coinage, as there are only two men involved. The transition
                     is clear. First comes a college of triumviri with the old mark X followed by supplementary denarii with <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/>.
                     This mark now became regular, as Kubitschek, (<hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>) has admirably noted. It arose from the need of avoiding in
                     matters of bookkeeping the ambiguous X and in distinguishing between XVI as a number and as six denarii. This new mark was brought about by
                     the evaluation of the denarius at sixteen asses, which, according to <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> occurs in the time of the Gracchi,
                     more probably in the time of the younger Gracchus. Our order also confirms the opinion of Kubtsschek that XVI and <graphic
                        url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> have a close connection.<ref target="#CH2-n22a">22a</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we follow the above reasoning the initial date of Group 4 may be fixed at 118 B.C. Its final date will be obtained from the beginning of
                     the next group, which is marked by the new coinage of quinarii around 104 B.C.</p>
                  <p>Here we meet the first "serrati" (cp. <name type="pname">Mattingly</name>, NChr. 1924) with names of moneyers (for the occasional
                     appearance of few anonymous "serrati," with wheel as a badge, see BMC 11. 215). If the view that they were struck for external trade is
                     correct, the assumption that our denarii were struck for Narbo gains fresh support.</p>
                  <p>Transiton, special coinage for the foundation of the colony of Narbo, therefore only denarii, and those "serrati" The triumviri of the mint
                     still use X, the supplementary denarii have <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/>. All are marked L.LIC:CN DOM.</p>
                  <p>a. Regular college of triumviri.</p>

                        of piso (Group 6), after marks of denomination had ceased to be used. Probably, they are not to be taken as marks of the denarius, but
                        as symbols, such as were fashionabte at the time(cp. no. 49 and Bf. III. 100). We meet all these marks of value in the coinage of the

                  </head>
                  <p>The beginning and end of this group can be surely fixed. The As is again struck. Here we find the last bronze of the Uncial standard
                     (supposing the weights to be correct), since the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name> of 89 B.C. introduced
                     the semi-uncial standard. Our group then extends to the beginning of 89 B.C. Its beginning is determined by the reintroduction of the
                     issues of Quinarii. As Pliny (33.3.13) reports, the Victoriate was again introduced by the Lex Clodia, but was now equal to the Quinarii
                     (Maecianus, distrib. 45 Hultsch, <hi rend="italic">Metr</hi> . <hi rend="italic">script. rell</hi>., p. 66). Perhaps the Reissue of the As
                     was also prescribed by the law in A manner similar to the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name> which also
                     contained additional regulations. The date of the Lex Clodia is uncertain. Probably the Clodius is the same person as the Cl. Pulcher, to
                     whom the "elogium" of 92 B.C. refers (p. 8), who was AED CVR in 99 B.C. and praetor in 95. A denarius of 106â104 B.C. is ascribed to him
                     (No. 46b). If this is right) the date of the Lex Clodia is fixed at 104â102 B.C. (Kubitschek, 38, cp RE, Suppl. VII. 383). This date is
                     confirmed by the coinage, for the first Quinarii of Egnatuleius have no symbols, and symbols were not introduced until after 100 B.C. The Q
                     on this half-piece is read by many as <hi rend="italic">Quinarius,</hi> but Kubitschek has given good reasons for believing this
                     interpretation improbable (Stud. 39). The coinage of Fundanius is most instructive. He has the Q on denarii as well as on Quinarii, and so
                     it must always be read as "Quaestor," as on earlier issues and on inscriptions. If two meanings had been possible, they would have caused
                     confusion. The half-piece was generally marked as a Victoriate, equals Quinarius, by its reverse type of Victory, as well as by its size
                     and weight. I invariably interpret Q as <hi rend="italic">Quaestor</hi> (so too IN 271 and no. 5) and class all Quinarii of our group as
                     special coinages. It is, perhaps, not improbable that this new denomination, as a special issue, was at first struck by the quaestors. The
                     regular Quinarii of the next group no longer bear the mark Q.</p>
                  <pb n="29"/>
                  <p>The mark of value, <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> appears only sporadically and occurs once in the next group, which is closely connected
                     with ours; X too appears sporadically on a few denarii of Albinus. It must be supposed that these signs were no longer considered marks of
                     value. Especially on the family coins of Piso Frugi (Nos. 55. 69) <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> is only a survival. For <name type="pname"
                        >C. Piso</name>, <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> and XVI appear side by side, and evidently had the same meaning. The number of Mettius
                     (No. 82) are also archaizing. In general, there is a definite falling away from the earlier strict ordering that was observed in the
                     make-up of the denarius. For, apart from anything else, the legend ROMA on the denarii and the head of Bellona grow steadily rarer and are
                     used quite arbitrarily. It is obvious that the moneyers were allowed more license over the external forms of the denarius (so too in Group
                     4, above). Hence the reverse types also become more and more varied; the obverses also display all manner of heads, gods and <hi
                        rend="italic">numina</hi>; the head to the left becomes increasingly common.</p>
                  <p>In exchange, a new system of control was introduced, which kept on developing and was chiefly used for heavy coinages. Inasmuch as these
                     innovations certainly emanated from the highest financial official, that is to say, from the quaestor, they supply us with a sound guide in
                     regard to the arrangement. The first marks of issue to be used are the symbols, which had already been placed on the coins in the early
                     period as badges of the moneyers. Next come letters which had already appeared on the Romano-Campanian didrachms following an Egyptian
                     model. Whether A and B on the denarius of <name type="pname">C. Serveilius</name> (No. 37) may be taken as precursors of these letters, may
                     be left undecided. Finally number are extensively used. All the marks are often used in combination.</p>
                  <p>All these details give us a principle of arrangement. In the first place, I put the supplementary issues, the last of which together with
                     marks of issue must be arranged inside the regular coinage. There are two divisions. The first contain four colleges of triumviri with
                     supplementary denarii after an old model without marks of issue. Only in the last college of triumviri do we find a modest beginning of
                     symbols. The transition from <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> to star is of great interest for the development. The second division includes
                     the issues of the quaestors. The earlier ones are still without marks of issue. The later are introduced by the special suppremeniary issue
                     of Piso-Caepio, which already (according to Bf III, 101) shows eight varied symbols. Traditionally, 100 B.C. used to be taken as a fixed
                     date (BMC I. 170) for this coinage, but Sydenham (in NChr. 1941, 164 ff.) has now shown good reasons for questioning this date. He now
                     places these denarii in 96/95 B.C.<ref target="#CH2-n32a">32a</ref> I must admit that I do not know on what grounds his assertion is based
                     that the coinage of Silanus and Piso is safely to be dated to 90 B.C. The bronze of both moneyers, especially of Piso, already has the
                     semi-uncial standard, and therefore must have been issued after the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name> and
                     not earlier than 89 B.C. But for our general picture this is of no great importance. According to our suggested dating the quinarii of
                     Egnatuleius must have been struck about 100 B.C. The other issues consist mainly of quinarii.</p>
                  <p>The arrangement of Group 4, i. e., denarii and bronze series plus two denarii series, except that bronze now becomes scantier and declines,
                     are continued in the regular coinage, which may begin ca. 95 B.C., if we follow the dating of Piso-Caepio, as it already shows distinct
                     marks of issue.</p>
                  <pb n="30"/>
                  <p>From this point I have stopped describing the reverse types inasmuch as they are now so very changeable. I do, however, quote the marks of
                     issue, SB equals "symbol," L equals "letter," (gr. equals "Greek"), N equals "number". If the marks of issue appear on both obverse and
                     reverse, I write obv. and rev. Corr. Sb. means the obverse and reverse correspond to one another. Occasionally we meet "serrati" again.</p>

                  <p>The initial date is supplied by the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name> of 89 B.C. For this law and its
                     contents, see the note on the "argentum publicum" (p. 58). It is expressly mentioned on the anonymous bronze and on the rare sestertius.
                     From this law there stem the following reforms: 1. Introduction of the semi-uncial standard. 2. Issue of sestertii. 3. Coinage out of the
                     "argentum publicum". 4. Special colleges of triumviri, which serve as supplements and, in part, also work anonymously. Actually we have
                     occasionally met such colleges before. But now they are prescribed by law and continue into the next group. The disturbances of the period
                     are shown: I. By the numerous supplementary issues, with their various special formulae, and also with such descriptions of office as AED
                     CVR and PLEB, and PRAETOR, the last two of which appear only here. 2. By a rich coinage of denarii. For example the list of finds in BMC
                     III. 14 gives from the Find of Fiesole, 125 for Silanus, 211 for Piso Frugi, 439 for <name type="pname">Q. Titius</name>, 50 for Vibius
                     Pansa; from the Find of <name type="pname">M. Codruzzo</name>, 67 for Silanus, 323 for Vibius Pansa, 253 for <name type="pname">T.
                        Sabinus</name>, 308 for Cn. Lentulus, 167 for the anonymous coins that follow Bursio, 194 for the anonymous coins that follow "Garg."
                     "Oguln." "Vergil." (194 of these in Carbonaria I). Moreover the numerous marks of issue, among which numbers too now occur and
                     preponderate, especially in Group 7, are evidence of heavy striking. Often now the same moneyer uses a number of types. Under the influence
                     of the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name>, the coinage of bronze rises to an abundant issue, then falls to
                     the bare As and finally disappears from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> until the days of Augustus. It is remarkable
                     that some Asses also have marks of issue. Marks of issue, on the other hand, are missing in some issues of denarii. The determination of
                     the denominations of bronze is here again very difficult and uncertain. For an isolated appearance of <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/>, see
                     the introduction to Groups. A peculiarity of the group is the number of special colleges of triumviri (five of them) which are closely
                     attached to the normal issues,<ref target="#CH2-n39a">39a</ref> often strike with the same types and occasionally exchange the third
                     moneyer. Two continue anonymously with the same types and show an issue more plentiful than the normal. This provides immediately certain
                     links between different coinages.</p>
                  <p>The order is based on the following observations. At first three denarii and bronze series are issued just as in Group 5, i.e., As, Semis
                     and Quadrans. An occasional appearance of the Triens is not yet quite certain, but possible. In the second section, only the leading
                     moneyer strikes the As, or it is added supplementarily. Towards the close it, too, disappears. The serrati, which are common in the next
                     group, begin to appear.</p>

                  <p>A. First with As, Semis, Quadrans: The Triens is uncertain.</p>

                  <p>In the last group we found five special colleges of triumviri which were closely attached to the normal coinage. In this group such
                     colleges become the rule. There is one special group with six series in each of which a normal issue corresponds to a special issue. The
                     single issues too seem to run parallel to each other, as the example of <name type="pname">Marius</name> (cp. p.62, iteratio) shows. The
                     bronze coinage is now lacking, and with it we lost an important principle of arrangement. The plentiful issues of <hi rend="italic"
                        >serrati</hi> in the series of both kinds is surprising. Here we place the supplementary denarii of <name type="pname">M.

                     five principal games. Only the last issue for the games of Apollo has a special formula; but it is very weak numerically, as its rare

                        <name type="place">Balbus</name>, a member of the Marian party, was defeated and killed by Sulla's legate, <name type="pname">L.
                           Philippus</name>, in 82 B. C. (Liv. Ep. 86). Since he struck in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>, his coinage
                        must have been issued a year earlier, for the office of praetor had long been, <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>, biennial, so that the
                        first year was spent in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> and second in the province. From Sulla on (81 B. C.) it
                        was so <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> as well. If <name type="place">Balbus</name> struck as governor of Sardinia, we must expect PRO
                        PR.; for that formula is old, dating back at least to the SC DE BACCHAX (StR. II. 199 f<hi rend="italic">.) :</hi> in rare cases,
                        however, "praetor" stands for PRO PR. (StR. II, 240, 5), but it must not be read so on coins. A coinage in Sardinia is on the whole out
                        of the question. To explain the special issue, Cavedoni (cp. BMC. I, 345, n.) used the information in Val. Max. VII. 6. 4., that owing
                        to the dearth of money, temple furniture of the precious metals was melted down. In any case it was a money of necessity.</p>
                     <p>Taken by itself, the fact that a praetor was entrusted with the coinage is surprising. It is the only case of which we know. The
                        competence of the praetor was almost exclusively legal. Even when representing the consul in his absence he seems, according to <name
                           type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> (StR. II. 236), to have had no control over the "Aerarium". It was not till
                        after the battle of Actium that Augustus appointed "praefecti aerar. Saturni." who were taken from among the praetorii (StR. II, 558),
                        and in 23 B. C. he decided on tw'o "praetores aerarii" <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> II. 202), who lasted till Claudius, A. D. 44.
                        In our case we must find the occasion in the exceptionally troubled times then prevailing in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome"
                           >Rome</name>.</p>

                     <p>Read by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, MW. 620, 11. 451, as "S C de thesauro": a contribution to the games
                        of Apollo was made from the public chest. If this is so, we should have an issue, covered partly by the senate, partly by private funds.
                        This is hard to believe. I can find no evidence that "thesaurus" can bear this meaning. Perhaps D T refers to the "senatus
                        consultum."</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>In this group we meet for the first time the designation of office, IIIVIR, at first, IIIV, then always in full. It is carried by the
                     leading moneyer. In the next group the title is used longer. The connection with the group is supplied by the marks of issue, which appear
                     here for the last time<ref target="#CH2-n48">48</ref> in two colleges of triumviri, the second of which again issues <hi rend="italic"
                        >serrati.</hi> In the next college these <hi rend="italic">serrati</hi> are struck for the last time. The next six colleges of triumviri
                     cannot be determined either in their composition or in their relative sequence. Perhaps considerations of style might help in forming
                     groups but care must be taken in using style. Bf II. 78 has remarked that large and small heads appear often side by side in the same
                     issues without any possible explanation. Perhaps two diecutters with different conceptions of their task may have been at work. The head to
                     the left now becomes the more common.</p>
                  <p>The contemporary types begin in this period with direct reference to events of contemporary history. The first example is that of Scaurus
                     and Hypsaeus in 58 B.C. Certain dates are still lacking in the regular coinage. At best the denarii of <name type="pname"
                        corresp="#wikidata_Q1365457">Faustus Sulla</name> may be dated 64â62 B.C. On the other hand, for the special coinages, we do have such
                     dates âfor Galba and Plaetorius 70â69 B.C., for Scaurus and Hypsaeus 58, for Plautius and Plancius 54. All these men strike as curule
                     aediles, the second and third pairs at the same time. One is inclined then to make the same assumption for the first pair which <name
                        type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> (MW 621 f.) has actually assigned to 69. In StR II 588, no. 2, <name type="pname"
                        corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> sees in Plaetorius the colleague of <name type="pname">C. Flaminius</name> (arguing from Cicero,
                        <hi rend="italic">Pro Cluentio</hi>, 45, 126) and takes the year 67 B.C. as a probable date; but it is certainly not proved that this
                     Plaetorius is identical with our <name type="pname">M. Plaetorius M. F. Cestianus</name>.</p>
                  <p>The special coinage of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q1365457">Faustus Sulla</name> is usually connected with his quaestorship in
                     54 B.C. This is not necessarily correct. Babelon (II. 513) has him strike with Messalla. Both were quaestors in 53 B.C. but in I. 422
                     Babelon adheres to the tradition whichgives 54 as Sulla's date. In the case of Messalla, it is uncertain whether the consulship of his
                     father, mentioned on the Denarius, fell in 61 or 53 B.C.; a Messalla was consul in both of these years.</p>
                  <p>The order that results is as follows: First come the two colleges of triumviri with issue marks, then, continuing them, the third with <hi
                        rend="italic">serrati</hi>; then come six colleges in uncertain sequence; the group is rounded off by the special coinages in
                     chronological order. The period into which the group must be fitted would therefore have for its beginning the coinages of the two aediles,
                     Galba and Plaetorius, ca. 70 B.C. (the last appearance of issue marks suits this date very well), for its end, the Denarius of Plautius and
                     Plancius, perhaps also of Messalla, 54â53 B.C. Since the next group probably begins in 49 B.C., our time limits will be 70 and 50. In Nos.
                     71 and 72, M<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">3</hi> strike together, in No. 72 each also strikes by himself. The same is true of
                     No. 78.</p>

                  <p>We now come into the light of recorded history. Quite a number of fixed dates are available. In the regular coinage the number of moneyers
                     increases to four. This is reported by Suetonius (Caesar 41) but without mention of the year. Also, Dio (41.4.4.) tells how Caesar in 44
                     B.C. was granted the right to place his portrait upon the coinage.<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> Since the first college of triumviri
                     actually shows the portrait of Caesar, the extension of the college of triumviri, like that of the triumviri capitales, is rightly placed
                     in the same year.<ref target="#CH2-n54">54</ref> There are five moneyers in all, who now produce the portrait of Caesar. Two of them, Buca
                     and Chilo, expressly designate themselves quattuorviri. Our previous research has shown that it is only the leading moneyer who bears the
                     title of office. These two then must belong to different colleges. Four of these moneyers give indications that may serve as dates. Mettius
                        <pb n="40"/> has DICT IIII, Buca DIC PERPETVO, Macer and Maridianus PARENS PATRIAE. All these indications converge on the year 44 B.C.
                     In spite then of various discrepancies, which Ganter has recorded in ZfN, 1895, 182 ff., it is unquestionable that this college worked in
                     44 B.C. Moreover, Macer has another type which shows Antony in mourning and which must be later than the Ides of March.<ref
                        target="#CH2-n55">55</ref> An extension of his activity as moneyer over two years, such as Ganter proposes, is out of the question, in
                     view of all the facts which have been considered.<ref target="#CH2-n56">56</ref> Chilo continues to strike with the portrait of Caesar in
                     another series, now undated. He expressly designates himself IIIIVIR PRI FL. It is the only occurrence of this formula, but it is a vital
                     one. His college issues denarii only, supplementary denarii, which I still assign to 44 B.C. Here then two colleges are active in the same
                     year (cp. p.64). Supplementary coinages are of course frequent enough.</p>
                  <p>A second fixed point is given by the college of Varus, Mussidius, Regulus and Clodius. To some extent in the regular coinage, but
                     particularly in the special issues, this college has one issue with the portraits of the III viri R.P.C. I place them therefore after the
                     treaty of Bononia (November, 43 B.C.), i.e., in 42 B.C. Their special coinage bears the old formula, A P (here, perhaps, to be read as
                     "auro publico"), with F ("feriundo") added. From now on, the portrait of the ruler becomes the normal form.</p>
                  <p>Even more indications of date are given by the special coingae. For 49 B.C. Nerius, the <hi rend="italic">quaestor urbanus</hi>, is fixed
                     by the consuls. The coinage of Caesar in aurei, denarii and quinarii with LII (the fifty-second year of his age) is very probably of 49
                     B.C. (BMC. I, 505, n. I.). The second gold coinage of Caesar with DICT ITER is placed in 47 B.C. Hirtius in 46 B.C. and Plancus in 45 are
                     quite certain. Here, for the first time, we meet the <hi rend="italic">prae-fectus urbi</hi> on coins. Caesar, as dictator, 46â45 B.C.,
                     appointed from six to eight such prefects âtwo of them for the <hi rend="italic">aerarium</hi> in place of quaestors, as there was a
                     scarcity of regular officers at the time (STR. I. 668. n. 2, following Dio, cp. STR II, 729). Apart from Hirtius and Plancus, we have other
                     such praefecti as Cestius and Norbanus, whom I include in the same group and date in 45 B.C. The year 44 B.C. brings the gold coinage of
                     Caesar with COS V DICT IIII. We have yet one more <hi rend="italic">praefectus urbi</hi>, who had earlier been functioning as moneyer
                     âTivineius Regulus. Octavian probably appointed him to his office, before he left <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>
                     <ref target="#CH2-n56a">56a</ref>. That he was at the same time a moneyer âquite a young man âneed not surprise us. Young men were
                     expressly chosen by magistrates to represent them, just because no special qualifications were required (Cp. StR, I. 671, especially n. 3).
                     Regulus <pb n="41"/> on his own types has the <hi rend="italic">sella citrulis</hi> (as Cestius and Norbanus had), with one or two fasces,
                     such as belong to the <hi rend="italic">praefedits urbi</hi> (StR, I. 672); but on those of his father, who was praetor, he quite correctly
                     has six.</p>
                  <p>Apart from this the points which determine our arrangement are the following. Quinarii and sestertii are re-introduced âfirst issued only
                     by the leading moneyer, then by the whole college. In the last of these colleges, in 44 B.C., Maridianus strikes the denarius only, as if
                     to prepare the way for the pure denarii coinage which follows. As regards coinage in gold, Caesar himself struck almost regularly. Under
                     the IIIviri R.P.C., coinage was issued primarily by the regular moneyers at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>, then by
                     each potentate in his own provinces. The last college is defective and shows only the portrait of Octavian. The tension between the three
                     leaders had grown acute. The leading moneyer, Gracchus, still designates himself IIIIVIR, but we know of no colleague of his, except
                     Vitulus. The two others did not strike, probably because each potentate by now was issuing aurei and denarii in his own domains. In their
                     place we find the special issues of the first two moneyers. These last quattuorviri describe themselves as <hi rend="italic">quaestores
                        designati</hi>, but may nevertheless have been regular moneyers at the same time; the magistrates designate generally continued to rank
                     as private citizens (StR. I. 590). Hence the special coinage is expressly marked S C. BMC. I. 592 thinks that the title of Octavian, DIVI
                     F, gives us an indication of date, as he was only so entitled on the coins after 37 B.C. But BMC. II. 4 observes that Octavian's name was
                     DIVI F according to Caesar's testament in 44 B.C. Likewise CAH.X. 22 makes January 1, 42 B.C., the beginning of the title. No reason can be
                     seen then why this title should not appear earlier on coins. Otherwise there would be an inexplicable gap between 42 and 37 B.C., and an
                     isolated return of the moneyers to gold coinage is improbable. With 41 B.C. the regular senatorial coinage comes to an end for the time
                     being. Each IIIvir R.P.C. now strikes for himselfâOctavian in Gaul, Antony in the East, Lepidus in Africa. One difficulty in the system of
                     dating here proposed occurs with Vibius Pansa. He was, we are told, <hi rend="italic">trib. pl.</hi> as early as 51 B.C., but his activity
                     as moneyer in view of his sestertii must be dated later. Whether there is an irregularity here in the <hi rend="italic">cursus honorum</hi>
                     or whether our Pansa is not the same person as the other cannot at present be decided.</p>
                  <p>The leading moneyer at first still describes himself by his title on part of the denarii types.<ref target="#CH2-n57">57</ref> Only Buca
                     places the description on his quinarii. With the introduction of gold the practice disappears almost completely: APF points to a special
                     coinage out of the state chest. The addition of AAAFF now appears for the first time on a group of denarii of Maridianus, but seems only to
                     be used as an ornament in the reverse type. Remarkable is the re-occurrence of issue marks, just once, in the denarii series of Mettius. It
                     gives an impression of being an archaism, like X and <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> earlier. The moneyers usually employ all three names
                     âthe gentile name and the cognomen being written out in full.</p>
                  <p>It would be possible in this group to assign an issue to each year after 48 B.C., and a special issue to almost every year.<ref
                        target="#CH2-n57a">57a</ref> For 49 B.C., if our chronology is correct, we can only assume a special coinage. If this is so, this is the
                     first group which consists of annual issues. The second group, as we shall see, is the final coinage by the regular moneyers under
                     Augustus. After Caligula, annual coinage becomes the rule.</p>
                  <pb n="42"/>
                  <p>From 48 B.C. on there is regular coinage every year. With this occurs, generally speaking a special issue, particularly in gold. 49 B.C.
                     only special coinage.</p>

                     <seg type="note-symbol">56a</seg> The question whether a PRAEF VRBI was possible at this time must be faced. <name type="pname"
                        corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> (MW. 741, no. 6) thinks that Regulus, "Praef urbi," may have been the father of our moneyer. But
                     this is inconceivable, for on other coins with "Praef. urbi" there is no moneyer's name. He must, then, have held the office himself. Now,
                     we know from Tacitus, ANN. 6. II (StR. I. 663 note 3) that the Augustan "praefectus urbi" developed out of the old office; Caesar, as we
                     have seen above, paved the way. Octavian himself is said to have been in charge of the city under Caesar (Gardth, 48; another view in
                     Drumann-Groebe. III. 66). For 34 B. C., too, Dio reports that Octavian appoints prefects of the city (Dio 49. 42, StR. I. 668. n. 4).
                     Maecenas in 36 to 31 B. C. held a similar office (Gardth 766, RE Maecenas), and, soon afterwards, 26 or 25 B. C., the imperial "praefectura
                     urbis" developed out of it. As Octavian left <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> for the East in 42 B. C., such an
                     appointment would be in every way possible. Perhaps that is why Regulus copied the reverse types of Caesar's two "praefecti" Cestius and
                     Norbanus. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>: <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi> 668 n. 4. points out that "the III

                        gives a new and wrong interpretation of the passage in Dio. Dio says ÏÎ±ÏÎ­ÏÎ±ÏÎµ Î±á½Ïá½¸Î½ Ïá¿Ï ÏÎ±ÏÏá½·Î´Î¿Ï á¼ÏÏÎ½á½¹Î¼Î±ÏÎ±Î½ Ï°Î±á¼° Îµá¼°Ï Ïá½° Î½Î¿Î¼á½·ÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ±
                        á¼Î½ÎµÏÎ¬ÏÎ±Î¾Î±Î½. Grant proposes to apply ÏÎ±ÏÎ­ÏÎ±,, too, to ÏÎ±ÏÎ¬ÏÏÏ.á¾½ÎÎ½Î¿Î¼Î¬Î¾Ï, like all verbs of appellation, takes two accusatives. The first
                        is the external accusative, the second is predicative, showing what or to what a man is designated. "Father of the Country" is here such
                        a predicative accusative and cannot either in grammar or in sense, be applied to ÏÎ±Ïá½±ÏÏÏ. With this verb we must supply á½±ÏÏá½¹Ï as
                        reffering to ÏÎ±ÏÎ±ÏÏá½µÏ (type), the substantive form of ÏÎ±Ïá½±ÏÏÏ. Grant appears to earlier portraits of Caesar on Bithyman coins; but that
                        has no significance, for in the Greek East the use of the portrait had been common since the age of the Diadochi, and to that East
                        Bithynia belongs. In any case this dating cannot affect our chronology, for the college is securely fixed by the facts that it
                        records.</p>

                  <p>In the twilight of the sinking Republic a closed group with names of moneyers is revealed for the last time. Then they disappear from the
                     coins forever. This group throws valuable light on the transition to the Principate, for although the regular magistrates are still at
                     work, both the development of this series and its form show the dominating influence of the "Princeps." During the travail of the Empire,
                     while the IIIviri R.P.C. wrestled for power, the coinage was revolutionary, although, it is true, still based on the old right of a general
                     to strike in time of war. Each triumvir issues precious metal in his own domain, frequently on a large scale. The coinage of bronze on the
                     other hand remains indeed a revolutionary measure and hence is sporadic. Gradually the flood ebbs and Augustus sets about building the new
                     order. The coinage of the capital, among other things, needed attention, for as a result of the long cessation of issue of bronze, there
                     had been no regular coinage for sixty years, and there was a serious shortage. Augustus acted constitutionally through the moneyers. The
                        <hi rend="italic">cursus honornm</hi> had already been re-organized, probably in 27 B.C., as part of the general reform (StR. I. 544).
                     From what Dio (54.8) says about the year 20 B.C., <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> concludes that (when he took
                     over the administration of the Italian roads) Augustus instituted <hi rend="italic">curatores viarum</hi> (StR. II. 1034, no. 2; 1045 and
                     1077. In connection with this <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> places the abolition of the IIviri EXTRA VRBEM
                     PVRGANDIS and of the IIIIviri CAPVAM CVMAS.<ref target="#CH2-n59">59</ref> This then is the date for the origin of the new vigintivirate to
                     which the moneyers belong. It is natural, then, to connect with this reorganization the revival of the activity of the moneyers.</p>
                  <p>Thus we reach the year 20 B.C. as a starting point, which was determined by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, RM.
                     742 and Bab. I. XXXVI by a different route. For the end of this group we cannot go beyond 3 B.C., inasmuch as Augustus on February 5, 2
                     B.C. received the title of <hi rend="italic">pater patriae</hi>, which he bears regularly on his coins ever afterwards. It is completely
                     absent in our group. Altogether there are fifteen colleges of triumviri, of which two strike side by sideâSanquinius, <name type="pname"
                        >Lyicinius</name> and <name type="pname">Marius</name> in precious metal, and Sanquinius with Licinius and Gracchus in bronze. This is
                     the familiar case where the third man is exchanged for the supplementary coinage. We have now two principles to govern our arrangement. In
                     the first place the short period between 20 B.C. and 3 B.C., into which fourteen series have to be fitted, points to an annual coinage in
                     common with Group 9. In the second place it is evident that precious <pb n="45"/> metal and bronze were issued alternately. There are also
                     a number of fixed dates which will help us. The whole group has as a <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem,</hi> the year 23 B.C., in which
                     year Augustus took over the tribunician power for life. This power is mentioned regularly on the bronze, but only a small special issue
                     which was struck in common by the first three moneyers, is without it. However, I have omitted it here because its composition is so
                        doubtful.<ref target="#CH2-n60">60</ref> It would contribute nothing to our general treatment. A second <hi rend="italic">terminus post
                        quem</hi> is provided by the P(ontifex) M(aximus) on the two issues with the As only, for Augustus carried this title only after March
                     6, 12 B.C. For the coinage of precious metal the triumvirate of Mescinius, Vinicius and Antistius Vetus, no. 91 is fixed at 16 B.C. by
                     means of the dates TR. POT. VII. VIII. Other such <hi rend="italic">termini</hi> are 19 B.C., in which year the standards were returned by
                     the Parthians for the college of IIIviri, no. 88, and 17 B.C., the year of the Secular Games, for series no. 90. The end of the precious
                     metal coinage is marked by the opening of the mint of Lugdunum, which then strikes continuously. As Augustus was in Gaul in 16â13 B.C. and
                     pieces do exist with IMPX (15â13 B.C.), I consider it probable that the emperor made arrangements for the new issue of precious metal in
                     Lugdunum, before his departure in 13 B.C.</p>
                  <p>The relative order can be determined by internal factors. After such a long break in coinage, the heavier coinages naturally come first.
                     First there are in bronze two colleges of triumviri with sestertius, dupondius and bronze, then two with sestertius and dupondius and, with
                     them, two with As alone, which are supplementary issues. The first college of supplementary Asses, no. 95, first issues its own <hi
                        rend="italic">festival</hi> coinage, with head to the left and <name type="pname">Victoria</name> â Fortuna behind the head. A detailed
                     discussion of this issue, especially their false description as <hi rend="italic">triumphal Asses</hi> and the wrong interpretation of the
                        <hi rend="italic">gemma Augustea</hi>, will be found in my article which has been cited above. Now this <hi rend="italic">festival</hi>
                     issue must precede the ordinary one. The head to left was quite unusual at this time and continues for a long time as a <hi rend="italic"
                        >festival</hi> obverse. Then there follow two normal issues which copy the head left. An internal order can be reached also for the
                     quadrans which is so popular a denomination and appears here in a closed series of four issues. First comes the plentiful coinage (nos. 97
                     and 98) with three distinct reverse types. This is followed by the simpler one with four moneyers in each case. Here we can establish the
                     series, Betilienus, Naevius, Blandus and Catullus, no. 79, in which each moneyer strikes separately and has IIIviri added to his name. This
                     happened because at first only three moneyers were at work, then one fell out and a substitute replaced him. In the last series, however,
                     all four moneyers are mentioned together, but the title of IIIvir is mechanically repeated. For precious metals, too, some knowledge can be
                     gained of the internal order. The title of office is always given for two colleges of IIIviri. These are the first two colleges which coin
                     extensively and can be dated, as we have noted, as later than 19 and 17 B.C. respectively. The next two colleges strike on a smaller scale,
                     as may be seen from the list in Bf. Goldm. 141f. These place their titles on only a part of their coins. The last, scanty series of
                     Cossutius and his colleagues no longer carries the titles. Indeed this was the end of precious metal coinage in <name type="place"
                        corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> under Augustus.</p>
                  <p>From these results we can proceed with confidence to the arrangement of our Group.</p>
                  <p>An important question has yet to be answered: Was the whole coinage senatorial or not? Willers, p. 57f., and Bf., Goldm. 38f., following
                     him, as also BMC. I. LXVIII, are <pb n="46"/> inclined to assume a division of coinage, precious metal imperial, and bronze senatorial.
                     This view, however, depended upon the false assumption that Augustus had been striking in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome"
                        >Rome</name> at an earlier date from ca. 29 B.C. onwards. That this was not the case is proved in RIC.XV. All these coinages of precious
                     metal are foreign and belong to the East. At the same time coinage continues in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>
                     and after 13 B.C. exclusively at Lugdunum. Augustus in his coinage declines to imitate the example of Caesar, who struck in <name
                        type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> and created a very bad impression thereby. The citation of name and office of the
                     moneyers on both groups of metal in our period, together with the agreement in time, point to a single authority, i.e., of the senate, in
                     accordance with the concept of the old Republic.</p>
                  <p>It was equally erroneous to find in the emphasis on SC a special contrast between the senatorial coinage and the imperial. But there is a
                     vast difference between our S.C. and the formulae hitherto used under the Republic. In the earlier cases, the formulae were appended to the
                     type and denoted a special commission which was customarily conferred by a <hi rend="italic">senatus consultum.</hi> Our S.C., however,
                     forms the main reverse type and is copied by Eastern bronze, which comes from Ephesus and Pergamum according to RIC.CXIX and covers the
                     period from 28 to later than 20 B.C. This bronze consists of sestertius, dupondius, As and semis and many of the coins show on the reverse
                     a large CA in a thick laurel wreath. This style with a thick wreath around a central type or legend, is not uncommon in the Greek sphere of
                     coinage and in this case may be derived from the <hi rend="italic">cistophori</hi>, which Antony and Augustus reissued. CA has been
                     explained <hi rend="italic">Commune Asiae. Consensu Augusti</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">permissu</hi> or <hi rend="italic">indulgentia
                        Aug.)</hi> breaks down on the ground that <hi rend="italic">consensus</hi> according to the TLL is used only of a number of persons.
                     Grant (F.I.T.A. 108) now proposes <hi rend="italic">Caesaris auctoritate.</hi> But this cannot be accepted. The use of <hi rend="italic"
                        >auctoritas</hi> as a title for the coinage is improbable at this time. It does not occur on coins. The <hi rend="italic">auctore
                        principe</hi> to which Grant appears means <hi rend="italic">at the instance of the Princeps</hi> (StR. III. 899).<ref target="#CH2-n61"
                        >61</ref> CA then designates the authority who coins. This type was now taken over at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome"
                        >Rome</name>, but the laurel wreath was assigned to the obverse, as the reverse was reserved for the legend of the moneyers. In place of
                     CA, the new striking authority S C was mentioned.<ref target="#CH2-n62">62</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Coinage year by year. At first bronze alternates with precious metal. Towards the end there are two issues of precious metal; then the
                     precious metal coinage migrates to Lugdunum; then there are two supplementary issues of the As. Finally the popular quadrans is struck in
                     four colleges of IIIviri. The names no longer show any ligature. Where S C or EX S C occurs, it is part of the type (Bf. Goldm. 139).</p>
                  <p>I. Bronze alternating with precious metal.</p>
                  <p>1. 20 B.C. This college of IIIviri has also a joint issue with head of Numa on obverse and no indication of date. See p. 45 above.</p>

               <p>Research in the last decade has yielded fresh and more reliable information in the field of Roman Republican coinage.<ref target="#CH3-n1"
                     >1</ref> Above all we have learned better how to appreciate Greek influence on Roman issues. The influence is even found on the <hi
                     rend="italic">Aes</hi> Grave. Only gradually have we come to the realization that the formal perfection of the cast money of <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> and even more clearly in many series of provincial Aes, bears definite testimony against
                  any kind of primitive essay and points to Greek technique. SBf, with his judgment based on the form of the prow, the regular reverse of these
                  coins, has arrived at the middle of the fourth century as a <hi rend="italic">terminus</hi> a <hi rend="italic">quo,</hi> and quotes a passage
                  (p. 33) from I,enormnnt,<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> which proves the development in mint technique. Willers (p. 28) also has made the
                  observation that the Roman Aes Grave stands on the level of Greek art of the late fourth century B.C. and bases his opinion on the judgment of
                  distinguished archaeologists. Altheim (<hi rend="italic">Row</hi> und <hi rend="italic">Hellenismus</hi>, 77f.) describes the period: "Mit
                  Beginn des 3. Jh. treten die gemeinitalischen Erscheinungen auf, archÃ¤ologische, sprachliche und geldiche Koine." (Cp. also BMC. XCVIf. and
                  Regling in Gercke-Norden, II. 27.)</p>
               <p>Today, the date for the beginning of Roman coinage has been brought down to a period later than the traditional one and places it at c. 300
                  B.C. I still believe that <name type="pname">Mattingly's</name> view is the most probable âthat the Romans at the close of the Samnite wars
                  with the ensuing conquest of middle <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> proceeded to issue Aes Grave as crude coinage
                  and brought in Greek die-sinkers or moulders from South <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> for assistance in this
                  work.</p>
               <p>The second phase is the so-called Roman-Campanian silver, the beginning of which is quite correctly placed at the end of the war with Pyrrhus.
                  The dissension among the <name type="place">Greeks</name> of South <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> brought
                  destruction just as it had done to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> in the days of Philip II. The Romans became the
                  masters of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> and a great power after the defeat of Pyrrhus at Beneventum in 275 B.C.
                  and the occupation of Tarentum and Rhegium in 270. Hence he Romans were compelled to strike money for use abroad and to strike on an Italian
                  standard and pattern. There were circulating at that time in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, Sicily and also in
                  Acarnania, standard coins with a weight of 7.5 (Phoenician standardâCp. Giesecke, DMzbl. 1934. 183). Giesecke follows D'Ailly (In 177) in the
                  assumption that the Romans had their first coins struck at Greek mints. Hands <hi rend="italic">(Italo-Greek Coins</hi>, 1912, 64) and <name
                     type="pname">Mattingly</name> (NChr. <hi rend="italic">loc.cit.</hi> 201) believe that traveling Greek die-Sinkers performed the work just
                  as the artists who signed their names in Sicily in the fourth century. Not only the types but <pb n="50"/> the legends as well betray their
                  Greek model. The ethnic first appears in the genitive plural. Moreover, the use of Greek letters as issue marks goes back to Greek models,
                  particularly to the coins of the Ptolemies.</p>
               <p>Who are now the <hi rend="italic">mint-officials</hi> in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> who issue bronze and silver?
                  The right of coinage is that which is included in the control of coinage by the state. It is the right to make all arrangements, necessary for
                  the organization and administration of the coinage (SWM. s.v.). Hence it is the exclusive right of the State and is naturally exercised in the
                  first place by the supreme magistrates in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> âthat is to say, by the magistrates cum
                  imperio (Cos., Proc, Propr, Dict.). Thus MW, 364ff. says: "Denn darin besteht ja eben die hï¿½chste Amtsgewalt, daï¿½ ihr Inhaber innerhalb der
                  durch die Gemeindeordnung gezogenen Schranken alle Rechte des Gemeindewesens insofern ausï¿½bt, als dieselben nicht Spezialbeamten ï¿½bertragen
                  sind.". As these supreme officials are never mentioned on coins <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> infers that the
                  original treatment of the coinage suggests the early removal of constitutional norms. The fact that the supreme imperium was constitutionally
                  restricted within the city implies quite clearly that a similar restriction was applied to finance and accountancy, and that in practice, the
                  superior magistrate had no influence on the administrarion of finance. Hence <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>
                  concludes that the coinage in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> had been taken away from the regular magistrates and
                  entrusted to special officers long before the appearance of the names of moneyers. The handling of finance and accounts had been from ancient
                  times a function of the quaestors, who, after 447 B.C. were elected in the Comitia Tributa and appear as manistrates. They administer the <hi
                     rend="italic">aerarium P. R.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Saturni</hi>), in which among other things the public money was stored (St R. II. 544
                  f.). They alone held the keys to the treasury. Hence it is natural to suppose that the control over the new money was given to the quaestors.
                  At this point no comparisons can be drawn between Roman and Greek (monetary) administration, for we know practically nothing about the
                  management of Greek coinage at this period. It is only when we come to the moneyers themselves that we can use such parallels. Of course the
                  quaestors appointed their own subordinates to supervise the production of coins. After the end of the war with Pyrrhus, although the conquered
                  states were forbidden to coin, still silver was at first produced, even in local Italian mints. But the financial difficulties of the Second
                  Punic War forced a greater concentration of coinage in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>
                  <ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> which implied greater activity and stronger control In the year 216 B.C., Livy (XXIII. 21) reports that <hi
                     rend="italic">propter</hi> penuriam <hi rend="italic">argenti</hi> the <hi rend="italic">viri</hi> mensarii were reintroduced,<ref
                     target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> this time as a Board of Three which continued until 210 B.C. (RE. Triumviri, 519). <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, considers them for the most part Commissioners of Supply, but does state that they were also
                  employed as assistants at the Treasury. They were certainly concerned with the supply of money in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome"
                     >Rome</name> (StR. 642. no. 1, according to Livy). In 210 B.C. all available gold, silver and bronze money, i.e., all the coinage together
                  with bullion, was delivered to them (Matt. Rob., <hi rend="italic">Proceed</hi>. Br. <hi rend="italic">Acad</hi>,, Vol. XVIII, 15). I consider
                  them the precursors of the moneyers. If the moneyers had already been in existence, these tasks would naturally have been entrusted to
                  them.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> phase of Roman Republican coinage is now reached. This is the issue of the denarius and its parts. Since the
                  revolutionary researches of <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> and Robinson and <pb n="51"/> the many subsequent refinements,<ref
                     target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> there can be no doubt that this universal Roman currency began not earlier then the period about the Second Punic
                  War. An exact date will probably never be established, but the period is enough. In addition to the arguments of the above authors, I wish to
                  work out the parallels with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, parallels which confirm the new date.<ref
                     target="#CH3-n6">6</ref> Under the rule of Macedon, there was practically no coinage struck at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens"
                     >Athens</name>. In 229 B.C. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> recovered her independence and began at once a new
                  issue of coins, the so-called New Style tetradrachms, which retained the old types with head of <name type="pname">Athena</name> and the Owl,
                  but differed considerably from the old types in form. Some administrative details have been preserved about this coinage which extends to the
                  time of Augustus. Sundwall<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> in particular has made good use of these coin issues. On these tetradrachms two or
                  three moneyers appear. The first have the form of monograms with a symbol attached. Then each name is written out but in an abbreviated form.
                  In the next period there are three names which are written out in full. Symbols are always present.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> Near the end
                  of this series two names appear again. The chronological sequence has not been settled. As in the Roman series the attempt has been made,
                  especially by <name type="pname">Sundwall</name> and Head, to identify these names with the names of known contemporaries. What office, nows
                  did these men hold? Examination has shown that two names change each year and one about every month. Scholars have assumed that the first two
                  moneyers held their office as a liturgy and the third moneyer simply as a charge (epimeleia) from the Areopagus, which during the Persian War
                  and nows after the deliverance by Demetrius Poliorcetes developed some financial activity (Sundwall, 49.70. no. 3; Boeckh, Staatshauch. ii.
                  38*, no. 237).<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Sundwall</name> (50, 15) further remarks that into this mint commission of the areopagus, which is placed in 180 B.C., it
                  was partiacularly such people as had already held the liturgy that entered as M<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">2</hi> (49, 70). M<hi
                     rend="sup">3</hi> was the real control agent. The first two moneyers were often young men in their twenties. Iteratio of office was
                  possible, although generally speaking it was forbidden (Hermann, Altert., 1. 105). M<hi rend="sup">1</hi> was the <hi rend="italic"
                     >leading</hi> moneyer and chose the symbol (50. 17). Although the moneyers were appointed annually, coins were not struck every year.<ref
                     target="#CH3-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>At this point a series of parallels with the denarius coinage are found. The administration is bestowed upon three annual moneyers who change
                  yearly and one of whom is the leading moneyer. These arrangements, especially the number of moneyers, three, correspond entirely to the Roman
                  administration and to the model of the earlier colleges of the triumviri, as will be shown in the next Chapter. The triumviri mensarii, who
                  immediately precede the moneyers, may have also had influence. Directly on the Athenian model, the Roman moneyers sign at first with symbol
                  and monogram. Gradually, the names come to be written out, at first only in a mutilated form, then complete. And in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>, too, coinage was <pb n="52"/> not struck every year. And yet in spite of all these agreements, the
                  national and political identity of the two peoples is faithfully preserved even in the choice of types, there the national goddess, <name
                     type="pname">Athena</name>, here the head of Diana of Nemi.</p>
               <p>The date also points to the influence of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. The renewal of national coinage in <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> pointed to a similar coinage in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome"
                  >Rome</name>. Now this is just the time when in addition to the old cultural relations which have been already mentioned, a political
                  rapprochement between <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>
                  took place. After the defeat of Teuta, the Romans in 228 B.C. sent embassies to all the larger Greek cities, for the first time to Corinth and
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. Many scholars who follow Tacitus (Ann. II. 53) believe a <hi rend="italic"
                     >foedus</hi> aequum was concluded at this time in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. I suppose that the Romans on
                  this occasion came to know the new coinage and its organization. All this tends to confirm the introduction of the denarius during the Second
                  Punic War or shortly thereafter. If my hypohhesisâthat the IIIviri MENSARII were precursoss of the moneyersâis accepted, the date 210 is
                  obtained as a <hi rend="italic">terminus</hi> a <hi rend="italic">quo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first appointment of the IIIviri Monetales coincided with this new series of denarii. At the most it might be questioned whether the first
                  anonymous denarii were issued under the moneyers or by the financial authorities who preceded them. But only conjectures exist at this point
                  and the matter has no great importance because of the slight extent of this coinage. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825"
                     >Mommsen</name> placed the first appearance of names of moneyers in 216 B.C., but steadily maintained that the office was not yet
                  permanent. Even earlier Barthï¿½lemy (RN. 1847. 354) had expressed the probability that the moneyers were introduced at the time of the gold
                  coinage, which he placed in 207 B.C. <name type="pname">Samwer-Bahrfeldt</name>, p. 167, think that the office was possibly introduced at the
                  very beginning of the denarius coinage, which he still places at 268 B. C. All these estimates, which are also found in more recent works,
                  point either to the Second Punic War, or to the contemporary appearance of the college of triumviri and the denarius coinage. A more precise
                  statement of the problem has often been missing. Above all Mommssen's views that the triumvirate became a permanent office only in the first
                  century B.C., has lived on. We shall discuss this in the next chapter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Inasmuch as the IIIviri Monetales formed a regular part of the XXvirate, it will be of advantage to begin by a consideration of that body.<ref
                     target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> Indeed we do not know much about it.<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> The oldest college seems to be the X stlit.
                  ivd., the beginning of which is placed (StR. II. 605) in the age which saw the formation of the plebs. The law of 449 B.C. mentioned this
                  college as already existing. These decemvirs are recorded on inscriptions more frequently than the other officers (cp. n. 12). Inasmuch as
                  they are missing in the list of offices in the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> Bantina and <hi rend="italic">Repetundarum</hi>, <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> assumes that they were appointed originally by the praetor and only elected by the Comitia in the
                  age of the Gracchi. Next to them in age come the IIIIviri CAP. CVM., who as PRAEF. IVR DIC. probably go back to the year 318 B.C., but can
                  only be claimed as magistrates at a later date because of their absence in the above laws. The third college is the college of the IIIviri
                  Capitales, the introduction of which is mentioned by Livy, EP. 11 in ca. 290 B.C. They were probably appointed in the first instance by the
                  praetor. By a <name type="pname">
                     <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> Papiria</name>, which Festus cites and which is dated after 242 B.C., popular election was extended to this
                  office too. (StR. II. 595).</p>
               <p>The Second Punic War has already been established as the probable date for the first appearance of the moneyers, in part by the development of
                  the coinage and in part by the parallel with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. As has been observed above, it was an
                  office for young men of noble families. Groag's observations about the second century of the Empire agree with this (p. 8). In common with the
                  other offices in the XXvirate, it ranked as a step to the senatorial career. These questions have now to be answered, how appointment took
                  place and whether the office was permanent from the beginning. If an analogy is sought with the other colleges of the XXvirate, it is found
                  that the moneyers are most similar to the IIIviri Capitales. In both cases there are three men: Caesar increased both colleges to four;
                  Augustus reduced them again to three. The Capitales, like the Xviri stl. ivd., are believed to have been nominated originally by the praetor,
                  since they were indeed his assistant.<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> Hence it might be conjectured that the MONETALES were first nominated by
                  the quaestos, since they were his assistants. Against this interpretation it must be stated that the quaestor, a minor magistrate, <hi
                     rend="italic">sine imperio</hi>, was not qualified to nominate assistants from the greater houses. In fact nobody has supported this view.
                  As second possibility would be that the Monetales, like the IIIviri A.D.A., were appointed by the Comitia as the need arose. <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> (StR. II. 641) shares this view, for he describes the moneyers as not a permanent
                  office until the Social War (op. cit 601). But very serious doubts come up. In the <pb n="54"/> first place the appointment of IIIviri A.D.A.
                  was surely quite exceptional and uncommon. It could be foreseen and the Comitia could be summoned to elect the men in accordance with the
                  statutory terms. Also, it was necessary each time to stipulate exactly the jurisdiction and field of the commissioners With the coinage it was
                  quite different, although for a long time it had been regulated according to the requirement, as has been shown above (p. 51). But these
                  requirements, often present on a large scale, were very pressing. It would have been quite against the spirit of Roman administration to
                  institute upon each occasion an election of coinage officiate. Once they had made up their minds to entrust this business to a special group
                  of officials âand the evolution of the coinage suggests this course âarrangement for a permanent authority must have been made at once. The
                  only possibility left is the third one âthat the moneyers from the beginning were elected each year in the Comitia, as we concluded in the
                  last chapter from the parallel with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. Perhaps there is a kernel of truth in the
                  report of <name type="place">Pomponius</name> (DIG.I. 2.2.30 see p. 7) about the creation of the individual magistracies. <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> has rejected this passage as wrong and useless (MW. 367 n. 5 and StR. II. 695 n. 2.). But it would
                  be most plausible that after the moneyers were instituted as a permanent magistracy, election to the three already existing colleges should
                  also be prescribed by the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name>. The date of this law (after 242 B.C.) ties in
                  very neatly, and it does agree for the most part with the chronology of <name type="place">Pomponius</name>, who places the XXviratte between
                  242 and 227. However, this determination of date must not be taken too exactly, as our experience with Pliny, N.H.XXXIII. 13.3. has taught
                  us.</p>
               <p>However, the objection has been raised that the colleges of triumviri of which we have knowledge were not sufficient for coinage every year.
                  Recourse has been had to the hypothesis of a term of two years. But this has to be rejected both on evidence of the coinage and on
                  constitutional grounds. The opinion that for many years only one or two moneyers were appointed must be completely rejected.<ref
                     target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> Although in collegiate offices each colleague acts separately with the exception of the IIIviri A.D.A. (MW.
                  457), yet the colleagues always act at the same time as a college. But, if we assume that only one or two of the Illviri Monetales struck,
                  while the others performed no noticeable activity and therefore were not mentioned, all that we have gained is the assurance that there were
                  moneyers who did not strike. We shall come back to this shortly. As the office of moneyer was built upon entirely different principles, there
                  would be no reason for their isolated action. In fact there must have been whole triumvirates which never struck. For the period from 41â20
                  B.C. in our arrangement or in any case, for a number of years between the last issues of the Illviri R.P.C. and the new coinage of Augutus,
                  there was no coinage of any kind in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>. But no one would maintain that there were no
                  moneyers during this interval. According to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> himself, the office had long been
                  permanent. Furthermore Cicero mentions a moneyer who never struck. Cicero (Ep. ad Att. X, II) had a dispute with a certain Vettienus, whom he
                  describes as MONETALIS. But no coins of his exitt.<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref> Hill <pb n="55"/> (Handbook, 132) takes this view in saying:
                  "An appointment does not seem necessarily to have entailed the issue of coins."<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref> But this does not mean that
                  such moneyers performed no functions. Certainly it would be possible that moneyers administered the stocks of money (cp. RE, <hi rend="italic"
                     >aerarium),</hi> and issued and controlled the coins already in existence as required. In a number of cases we have surprisingly rich
                  coinages (cp. L. Piso, no. 551, <name type="pname">L. Roscius</name>, no. 63, <name type="pname">C. Piso</name>, no. 69), which were perhaps
                  not distributed in one year. When enough coinage was available a new coinage was not started. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825"
                     >Mommsen</name> concludes from Cicero (De legibus, 3.3.6) that the XXviri were also employed as extraordinary assistants (StR. II. 593). A
                  parallel to this interpretation is found in the IIIviri monetales of the Empire, who appear on inscriptions down to the middle of the third
                  century A.D., but nothing is known about their work. Opinions with regard to their later employment differ widely (cp. Continued Existence,
                  below). On the supposition that they must have developed some activity, all kinds of hypotheses have been set up, but it may well be that only
                  the empty title was left as a first step in the career of office. In a similar manner, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825"
                     >Mommsen</name> assumes (StR. III. 609) that the IIIIviri CAP. CVM. lasted to Augustus but without official acticity.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> raised a second objection against an election every year: inasmuch as the two
                  nearly contemporary laws, the <hi rend="italic">Lex</hi> Bantina and the <hi rend="italic">Lex</hi> repetundarum (in their lists of offices)
                  do not mention the IIIViri Monetales any more than they mention the Xviri stl. ivd. and the IIIviri CAP. CVM. In his commentary on the laws
                  (CIL. I. 2<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> 441f.) <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> has gone fully into the matter and
                  in support of his view suggests that the office of moneyer was not yet permanent. But the <hi rend="italic">argumentum</hi> ex <hi
                     rend="italic">silentio<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref>
                  </hi> is always dangerous and just as various conjectures are given in <name type="pname">Mommsen's</name> commentary why this official is

                  <p>In a second passage, Ad. Att. XV. 13.5., our vettienus is again mentioned as monetalis, and we read: "... tricatur scilicet ut monetalis,"
                     (cp. p. 7) Professor Mras has been kind enough to give me the following note on the passage (he also refers to Ad. Att. XIV. 19.4) "Tricae
                     â impedimenta, tricatur â qui quidquid velit non aperte declara." Cp. Lucilus, Frag. 413 Marx: "Lucius Cotta senex, crassi pater huius . .
                     . magnus fuit trico nummarius, solvere nulli lentus," and Nonius, p. 22, 30. Marx.</p>
                  <p>"Tricones morosi et ad reddendum duri." That gives us the meaning of Ad. Att. XV. 13.5: was painfully exact in his accounts and slow to
                     advance money, as is to be expected of a moneyer. Hill. 133, note 1, (who only deals with the first passage) follows Barthï¿½lemy, RN. 1847,
                     358, in taking Cicero's words as a joke. Cicero wants, so to speak, to assign Vettienus the meanest place in the magistracy. But this
                     interpretation is forced for even the first passage and it conclusively refuted by the second. That Cicero should twice have made this
                     supposedly joking comparison and then added "tricatur ut monetalis" will not convince anybody. Moreover, the college of moneyers must have
                     been highly regarded in the XXvirate. According to Groag (p. 8) it was the most distinguished under the Empire.</p>

               <p>We are almost completely uninformed concerning the organization of the public mints during the Roman Republic. Conjectures of all sorts have,
                  of course, been set forth, but they lack a firm foundation. In connection with this topic a distinction must be made between the technical
                  operations and the administrative organization.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Since there is no direct information, only a few facts can be collected from parallels with Greek coinage, the Roman Empire, and the
                     general principles of Roman administration. Many hypotheses have been brought forward about coin technique in <name type="place"
                        corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name>, but there is no certainty. <name type="pname">Lenormant</name> in his third volume (Book III,
                     ch. III, I, Les magistrats monï¿½taires chez les Grecs') has brought together a number of these theories, but most of them are doubtful. One
                     fact, However, appears to be certain âin part at least the mint was let out to private individuals. This results at once from the well
                     known monetary treaty between Mytilene and Phocaea (IG. XII. 2. 1.) where the mint is let out annually to a lessee, who is responsible for
                     the alloy of the metal. Hence the preparation of the coin ingots<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref> at least was a private matter. This is in
                     complete agreement with ancient custom. In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> they were fond of letting out official
                     business and undertakings on lease. The <hi rend="italic">societates publicanoyum,</hi> i.e., the companies of tax-farmers, come to mind as
                     example. Mommseen also (StR. II. 639 n. I) makes a similar assumption, even if his inferences from CIL. VI. 9953 art oot valid.<ref
                        target="#CH3-n20">20</ref> The Handbuch d. Altertk.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> (V. 2. 280) states that the production of coins was
                     leased to a private company. Certainly this refers to the supply of metal,<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref> the preparation of the ingots and
                     possibly the flans. <name type="pname">Mattingly</name>, R.C. 28 also shares this opinion aod believes that the contracts were as usual
                     concluded by the Censors. Whether private enterprisers did the striking is questionable. Some information about the mint does exist from
                     the age of Trajan.<ref target="#CH3-n22">22</ref> At that time the casting of ingots was farmed out,<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref>
                     <pb n="57"/> but the actual coinage was handled by freedmen and slaves. The technical direction was under the <hi rend="italic">optio et
                        exactor</hi> as well as the master of the mint and standards, who himself was under the <hi rend="italic">procurator monetae</hi>, an
                     equestrian official. The supreme authority was the minister of finance who was called <hi rend="italic">a rationibus.</hi> In view of these
                     facts, it is probable that similar conditions prevailed under the Republic, namely, that the supply and preparation of metal was handled by
                     private business, but that the coinage itself was struck by public servants under the direction of the moneyers, who themselves were under
                     the jurisdiction of the quaestor.</p>
                  <p>There is a somewhat remarkable passage in Suetonius (Divus Iulius 76) who in speaking of Caesar's excesses writes: "Eadem licentia spreto
                     patrio more magistratus in pluris annos ordinavit ... Praeterea monetae publicisque vectigalibus peculiares servos praeposuit!" <name
                        type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49974517">Eckhel</name> (Dn.V.62.) supposed that Caesar handed over to his slaves the supervision of coined
                     money, i.e. of the <hi rend="italic">aerarium.</hi> Eckhul wrote: "non monetae signandae custodiam, sed monetae publice signatae." But it
                     is known that Caesar in 46â45 B.C. appointed from six to eight <hi rend="italic">praefecti urbi,</hi> two of them for the <hi rend="italic"
                        >aerarium,</hi> in place of the quaestors (StR. I. 668. no. 2). The <hi rend="italic">vectigalia</hi>, however, were under the
                     supervision of the censors (StR. II. 434). In spite of what Suetonius says about the <hi rend="italic">licentia Caesaris,</hi> no one will
                     believe that Caesar replaced these officials by his own slaves. Barthelemy (RN. 1847, p. 357) assumes that Caesar used his own in place of
                     public slaves for work at the mint. But against this interpretation stand the verb <hi rend="italic">praeposuit</hi>, and the connection
                     with <hi rend="italic">vectigalia. Peculiares</hi> does not necessarily mean his <hi rend="italic">own</hi>, but can signify <hi
                        rend="italic">special</hi>. The passage is obscure, but at least it seems to show that slaves were employed at the mint.</p>
                  <p>Struck coins passed into the <hi rend="italic">aerarium Saturni</hi> under the control of the quaestors. It was stored there until the time
                     came to issue it (RE. <hi rend="italic">Aerarium</hi>).</p>
                  <p>Besides the normal coinage, there were special issues as we shall see below. At times the metal for special issues was not obtained from
                     the market âespecially when none was availableâbut from the State Treasury (perhaps from aerarium sanctius). This is expressly stated on a
                     series of coins which were struck from 90 B.C. onwards. It it the so-called <hi rend="italic">argentum publicum.</hi> The following
                     formulae were used: on silver, P EX S C, EX A PV, ARG.PVB., A PV, PV, PA, P; on bronze, LPDAP; also on the rare sestertius: ELP. <ref
                        target="#CH3-n24">24</ref> To these may be added the examples of APF in Group 9. What does <hi rend="italic">argentum publicum</hi>
                     mean? In contrast to <hi rend="italic">argentum privatum,</hi> it is the money or metal which belongs to the State.<ref target="#CH3-n25"
                        >25</ref> Since it was chiefly silver that had to be procured for the coinage, it is this metal that <pb n="58"/> is especially
                     emphasized. Hence <hi rend="italic">ARG. PVB.</hi> denotes the metal which was stored in the <hi rend="italic">aerarium</hi> P.R. If by way
                     of exception, that was to be coined, there had to be some compelling reasons, and the granting of a special license. The reasons in this
                     instance may have been the dire needs created by the Marsic War. The collecting of material for coinage has become difficult, inasmuch as
                     insurgents, who were striking coinage themselves, hindered transport. The special license would have taken the form of a <hi rend="italic"
                        >senatus</hi> consultum, as we see from the addition to the denarii of Lentulus (No. 57 A). By means of such a <hi rend="italic"
                        >senatus</hi> consultum, the <hi rend="italic">arg. pub.</hi> was first released for use. Then a whole series follows with this
                     description but without the S. C.<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref> Here presumably instead of the emergency prescriptions of a <hi
                        rend="italic">Senatus consultum,</hi> a law existed.</p>
                  <p>The <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q6537588">Lex Papiria</name> actually appeared at this time. We learn from Pliny that this law
                     introduced the semiuncial standard (33.13.36: cp.p. 9 <hi rend="italic">leges</hi>). It is not known when this law was passed (RE. XXIV.
                     2399), but its date can be determined from the circumstances. On the bronze stands LPDAP, which may be read as <hi rend="italic">lege
                        Papiria de aere</hi> or better <hi rend="italic">de argento publico</hi> (since the law applied to money in general). These bronze coins
                     do follow the semiunrial standard. Hence Pliny's information is correct Now the tribune of the people for 89 B.C., <name type="pname">C.
                        Papirius Carbo</name>, introduced the <hi rend="italic">lex Plautia Papiria.</hi> The conclusion has, therefore, been justifiably drawn
                     that our law also derives from this tribune. Further, the sestertii which are indeed rare and were struck only by the moneyers bear the
                     formula ELP, which is expanded to <hi rend="italic">e lege Papiria.</hi> Hence it has been suggested that this provision was also contained
                     in the law. It is also natural to suppose that general permission to withdraw metal from the <hi rend="italic">arg</hi>. pub. to meet the
                     emergency formed a part of the law. In conclusion it may be stated that the supplementary coinages were issued at this period by a special
                     triumvirate, the regular moneyers coining with their own types a special issue with the new formula. The third moneyer is often
                     supplementary and the special issue anonymous but bears the same types as the main series. Therefore, it is believed that a clause relating
                     to this was included in the law. The effect of this law, in general, does not extend beyond this group. In Group 9, the formula APF is
                     found only once, i.e., <hi rend="italic">argento</hi> (or, as many prefer <hi rend="italic">auro) publico feriundo,</hi> without S C.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, the <hi rend="italic">lex Papiria</hi> contained four provisions: the reduction of the standard of bronze to half an ounce;
                     the re-issue of the sestertius; the permission to withdraw metal from the <hi rend="italic">aerarium</hi> for emergency issues; and
                     finally, the introduction of emergency colleges of triumviri.</p>

                     <p>About lessees of the mint we have the following inscriptions: 1. CIL. VI. 8455, where a "mancips officinarum aerariarum quinquae (sic!),
                        item flaturae argentariae" is mentioned. 2. CIL. XIV. 3642, where a "manceps aerariac monatae" occurs, 3. CIL. VI. 791, which names the
                        five "conductores flaturae argentar. monetae Caesaris" (there is a "flaturarius auri et argenti monetae" in CIL. VI. 8456). By "manceps"
                        one must understand the enterpriser, representing the company of farmers (RE. "manceps;" <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825"
                           >Mommsen</name>. ZfN. 1887. 28. no. 7). From inscriptions 1 and 3 it may be seen that it is the casting of the silver that comes
                        first into question. But, as there was no cast coinage in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> later than the third
                        century B. C., when the "Aes Grave" stopsâ in silver there was never any cast coinage at all. (Hirschfeld. VB.<ref target="#CH3-n2"
                           >2</ref> 185 needs correction here)âit can only be a question of the casting of the coin ingots, which, however, were made for all
                        three metals. The same assumption may reasonably be appiled to the five "off. aerar". We cannot, unfortunately, determine the date of
                        these inscriptions. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, loc. cit., is inclined to place them in the third
                        century. But the number of five "off aerar." suggests the second century, rather, as the coinage of AE became increasingly slighter in
                        the third. In the present state of our knowledge, it is true, we only know of six "officinae" for AR from the age of Balbinus and
                        Pupienus (cp. NZ. 1935. 24 and <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> â Sydenham, <hi rend="italic">Roman Imperial Coins,</hi> IV. 2.165).
                        In no event can we infer, with <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, that the AE coinage too was let out on lease.
                        To do so would run counter to the spirit of Roman organization.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It has already been stated above (p. 50) that, as was to be expected, the authorities who had charge of the coinage were from the beginning
                     the highest financial officers, the quaestors. Although the quaestors were magistrates <hi rend="italic">sine</hi> imperio their position
                     had, intentionally, been made fairly independent, since there was a general with to restrict the power of the supreme magistrates
                     especially in financial matters. (Cp. above, RWM. 265). <pb n="59"/>
                     <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> maintains (loc. cit. 363) "daï¿½ die Bestimmung der MÃ¼nzmetalle, die Feststellung
                     ihres Verhï¿½ltnisses zu einander, sogar die MÃ¼nzsorten, ï¿½berhaupt also Wï¿½hrung and Teilung der MÃ¼nze nadi rï¿½mischen Staatsrecht nicht anders
                     geordnet oder verï¿½ndert werden konnte als unrerZnstimmung ... der Volksgemeinde in den Tributkomitien." But this would only pertain to more
                     serious cases. In view of the existing development, it does appear that the normal coinage as it was determined by the community was left
                     to the quaestor. Major changes, especially of standards or denominations, were prescribed by a <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> We only know
                     explicitly of three (cp. above p. 9), but there were certainly others. Smaller innovations, and, in particular, exceptional issues in time
                     of emergency, were ordered by a <hi rend="italic">senatus consltum,</hi> Such were the so-called special issues, treated below, p. 69. For
                     the execution of such decrees the quaestor was, in the first place, responsible As a matter of fact, the first special coinage, no. 31, has
                     Q EX S C. The execution of the <hi rend="italic">senatus consultum</hi> is often given to other officials, the <hi rend="italic">aed.
                        cur.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pleb</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">praef. urbi,</hi> from the time of Caesar, once even to a praetor or
                     simply to a moneyer, who then places the S C on his issues (cp. p.64f). There are other special issues, with plain Q or <hi rend="italic"
                        >praef. urbi,</hi> once with <hi rend="italic">aed. cur.,</hi> but without S .C . We might conclude from this that, in emergency, such a
                     special issue might even be made without a <hi rend="italic">senatus consultum.</hi> But that is improbable. For, even if we assume that
                     the supreme financial authorities, the quaestor or his substitute, the <hi rend="italic">praef. aerarii,</hi> enjoyed such complete
                     powersâand there are serious constitutional objections to thisâthe idea would have to be rejected out of hand in its application to the <hi
                        rend="italic">aed. cur.</hi> It is more probable, then, that the plain citation of office was enough to indicate a <hi rend="italic"
                        >senatus consultum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All these considerations have led me, in arranging my material, to adopt as my first principle, the denominations because they were decided
                     on by the supreme financial authority. The fixing of standards should, of course, be a valuable guide, but complete confusion reigns in
                     this field since apart from the semiuncial standard, we have no exact information about their dates. For all details, see section on
                     metrology, p. 11 above. Parallel to the denominations runs the decision as to what metals are to be used; in both cases matters were
                     regulated according to the needs. A short summary of the results that we obtained in drawing up our Catalogue of the coins will illustrate
                     the point well.</p>
                  <p>Group I has a great deal of silver in all denominations, denarius, victoriatus, quinarius, sestertius, since it is a new issue. The
                     sestertius, however, is very rare, and, in the first period, is almost always anonymous. In bronze also we have the complete series from
                     the As to the Uncia. At first, precious metal and bronze are issued by the same moneyers, beside pure issues of silver. Whenever there was
                     a shortage of bronze a series of pure bronze was issued. The next Group carries on this supplementary bronze and supplementary silver also
                     occurs. Later, the series of silver and bronze are separated. The smaller denominations of silver do not seem to have been wanted and
                     gradually disappear. Towards the close, denarius and bronze series are again issued with all the denominations of bronze. The third Group
                     introduces a new system. Since there was, for the moment, no lack of bronze, only the leading moneyer strikes the quadrans, the chief
                     bronze denomination until the Empire (p. 12). Step by step, the bronze denominations are strengthened, first the Semis, then the Triens and
                     Sextans with the Uncia. The last college of triumviri has the old order again â denarius and bronze with all denominations. This continues,
                     at first, into the fourth Group. Then the denominations decline to the same degree to which they have increased in the <pb n="60"/> third
                     Group. But there are three distinct phases. They first grow weaker from the Semis downwards, then from the Triens and, at last, from the
                     Quadrans. Again we find the arrangement denarius and bronze series plus denarii series. In the fifth Group we recognize the effects of the
                     Lex Clodia which re-introduced the quinarius. There is, therefore, a heavy output for the most part in special issues. The As, also is
                     struck after a long intermission. Perhaps, this provision was also included in the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> analogously. In view of the
                     scantiness of our material, it is hard to say, how far the other denominations of bronze were struck. At first, they were probably
                     complete, but they soon became defective, and, in the very next Group, the sixth, the bronze ceases until Augustus. Here, for the last
                     time, the old order denarius and bronze is found down to the quardrans; then, only the leading moneyer strikes the As, and finally the As,
                     too, disappears. Finds indicate, on the other hand, that the coinage of the denarius was very heavy. In this Group are seen the full
                     effects of the Lex Papiria which ordered a new standard and the re-issue of the sestertius, together with other arrangements (see above, p.
                     58). In the seventh and eighth Groups only the denarius is struck. In the ninth Group the regular issue of gold begins, though it had long
                     been used <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> by military chiefs. Now, however, it seems to have been regulated by law. In silver a fresh
                     attempt is made to issue quinarii and sestertii. These three innovations obviously go back in their origin to the initiative of Caesar.
                     Whether they were regulated by law and, if so, how, is unknown. In Group ten, Augustus returns once more to the old orderâone college of
                     triumviri strikes precious metals, the other bronze. This is the last revival of the old form. As a conclusion, that indestructible
                     denomination of the Republic, the quadrans, is struck in two series, and then, the new form of the imperial coinage begins.</p>
                  <p>It was, of course, the quaestor also who determined the marks of value âin our period for silver they are, at first, X, V, and HS. After
                     the revaluation of the denarius, XVI appears and is later abbreviated to <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/> (cp. Groups 3 and 4). Even these
                     disappear later, and the increasingly heavy output of silver demands a sharper system of control. The institution of this system is again
                     incumbent upon the quaestors, and for some time was achieved by means of issue marks (Group 5ff). Finally, the quaestor had to fix the
                     amount of metal by weight to be used for each separate issue</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Number.</hi> As has been shown above in discussing the appointment of the moneyers and constitutional development of the
                     office, the number "three" must be reckoned certain from the first. It corresponds exactly by analogy to similar offices. Their
                     jurisdiction was independent (StR. II. 592), although also ancillary to the quaestor The only question is whether all three functioned
                     together, as Strasburger assumes for the IIIviri A.D. and Col. DED. (RE., Triumn. 515) or whether, as with the capitales, "ein
                     Zusammenwirken nicht erforderlich war" (loc. cit. 519).<ref target="#CH3-n27">27</ref> On the coins, each name usually appears separate,
                     but:, from Group 3 onwards, they also appear together. The same phenomenon is found recurring <pb n="61"/> in Group 10, the period that is
                     historically the clearest where the quadrans follows now one system, now the other. Other combinations, also, occur. In all, we find the
                     following forms: each moneyer alone; all three moneyers together; all three together and also each alone; three together and one alone with
                     the other two together; two together and all three together; two together and each alone; two together and one alone. Hence it is apparent
                     that it was left to the discretion of moneyers how they should sign. But, as the Catalogue of coins shows, all three always strike. It may
                     be supposed that, sometimes, each took over and controlled a part of the money to be minted, but that, at other times, two acted together
                     and the third alone, or all three together, and so on, with all the various arrangements just detailed. It is obvious that the distribution
                     of work in this respect was left to the decision of the moneyers.<ref target="#CH3-n28">28</ref>

                     <hi rend="italic">The Leading</hi> Moneyer. Although all three moneyers had the same responsibilities and functions, one of them was the
                     leading moneyer, as at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> where the first moneyer had the choice of the symbol
                     (Sundwall, 50, 17). For this, we have the following proofs: in Groups 3â5, he alone issues bronze; in Group 3, 30, he alone strikes silver
                     by himself, the other two strike together; in Group 4 he usually has the reverse type of Jupiter in a chariot; in Group 5 he alone
                     continues to use the legend ROMA; in Group 6 he alone strikes the sestertius and, later the As; most important are Groups 8 and 9, where he
                     alone bears the title of officeâNos. 71, 72 and 78, where, on each occasion, the M<hi rend="sup">1</hi> strikes alone, while the M<hi
                        rend="sup">2</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">3</hi> strike together are very enlightening. Full proof is given by No. 83, where <name
                        type="pname">L. Flaminiuis</name> expressly declares himself IIIIVIR PRI FL.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Substitutes.</hi> It was, of course, possible that, in the course of the year of office, a moneyer might drop out, in
                     consequence of illness, death or political reasons. In such cases, a substitute was co-opted. We have the following examples. In no. 27, A
                     Flaminius is replaced by Atilius in the second series, with XVI; in no. 37 for the new issue of the denarius and dodrans one moneyer is
                     replaced; perhaps it was the M<hi rend="sup">1</hi> , who has struck the exceptional denominations before, who dropped out. In the special
                     supplementary issues nos. 57 A and 58 A, the third moneyer is co-opted, as in No. 27, to replace a loss. The same thing happened in No. 90
                     A.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Duration of Office.</hi> For almost all offices, in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> as in <name
                        type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, duration was annual. But, in our case, we must expressly repeat that coinage was
                     not struck every year.<ref target="#CH3-n29">29</ref> An extension of office to two years, such as many scholars assume, is
                     unconstitutional and finds no support from the coins. Whether iteratio of a moneyer was possible is another question. Although in <name
                        type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> such reappointment was, as a rule, forbidden (Hermann. 1. 108), still clear
                     evidence exists for the Athenian moneyers in such formulae as TO ÎEÏ and TO TPI (Sundwall, 50, 16). For <name type="place"
                        corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>, StR. I. 522. states that, for the lower officers, Iteration zu alien Zeiten eine Ausnahme war." In
                     StR. I. 475. notes 2 and 3, dealing <pb n="62"/> especially with the XXvirate, a number of inscriptions are quoted, but there is no case of
                     a moneyer. However, we cannot deny the possibility of reappointment. Judging from our Catalogue of coins, we should only assume it for
                        <name type="pname">Marius</name> (nos. 65 and 66), who first appears in the regular coinage and then in the special coinage that runs
                     parallel to it.</p>
                  <p>We have now to answer the question, whether two colleges of triumviri ever functioned in the same year. First, we have nos. 1â15, denarius
                     and bronze series always alternating with one in bronze. The regularity and the mechanical sequence suggest that the variation covered more
                     than one year, that is to say, that one college of triumviri issued denarius and bronze in one year, the next college bronze in the
                     following year. For the beginning of our period this is not surprising, as people were still accustomed to use bronze and the demand for it
                     was, therefore, great, whereas silver was still unfamiliar. Only in the case of Suppl. denarius no. 5 can there be any doubt. For that age,
                     when the office of moneyer had just been introduced, it is better to suppose a yearly output. The same is true of the six series, normal
                     and special, alternating (nos. 63â68); their close connection suggests that they follow one another year by year. Only for <name
                        type="pname">Marius</name> must reappointment be admitted. With the late Suppl. Asses, nos. 95â96, a separate yearly issue is patent. It
                     is not so with the following numbers. In no. 27 there occurs a second series with mark of value XVI, in which M3 is replaced. It is natural
                     to assume here that the second issue followed in the same year, after orders for the new mark of value had been published âonly the third
                     man dropped out in the interval. We find the same phenomenon in nos. 90 and 90 A. For nos. 82 and 83, also, I have assumed that both
                     colleges of triumviri functioned in the same year. In view of the conditions of that troubled year, 44 B.C. this is not improbable. If this
                     is not accepted, then, the chronology must be changed. Special coinages, of course, are hard to control but I believe that nos. 57 A and 60
                     A were not issued in the same year as the normal coinage, for in 57 A one of the two moneyers dropped out, and <name type="pname">L.
                        Tur</name> us stepped into his place; yet we find him later in a special college of triumviri. In 60 A two moneyers, of colleges
                     separated in time, are included in a new special college of triumviri. Nos. 32 and 58 A, on the other hand, might well belong to the year
                     of the normal coinage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Titles of Office,</hi> The explanation of the title, AAAFF, is given in <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825"
                        >Mommsen</name>, MW. 366. notes 2 and 3. It would be superfluous to bother about mistakes in the inscriptions asking why an A is left
                     out or an F put in (cp.p. 8 above). These are simply errors. The first occurrence of the title known is in the elogium of Pulcher, 92 B.C.
                     (see p. 8). The first appearance on coins is on the denarius of Longinus, c. 70 B.C. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825"
                        >Mommsen</name> and others after him have inferred from his coins that a permanent office arose only at that time. But thus cannot be
                     correct. As long as the coinage lay in the hands of the moneyer, everyone knew that the signature on the coin was that of the moneyer.
                     Special coinages by other officials only appear quite sporadically, towards the close of the second century B.C. The first is that of the
                     quaestor, Torquatus, about the time of the Younger Gracchus. Gradually, however, these special coinages become more plentiful, particularly
                     in the 70's of the first century B.C. It was now necessary briefly to connect by a mark the moneyer with his office. He was simply
                     described as IIIVIR; the coins indicated what kind of triumvir he was. It was sufficient too to provide only the leading moneyer with this
                     title of office, as everyone knew that it was a college of three. So, too, with the IIIviri Capitales, we find that they had been long in
                     existence, before they appeared under their official title (St R. II. <pb n="63"/> 595). It may be maintained, then, that it was at about
                     the time of the Social War, or, rather, a little later, c. 70 B.C., that the designation of the moneyer became common on coins, but that
                     this does not imply anything regarding the permanency of office. The addition of AAAFF is only found in the last Group, 10; on coins of
                     Cossutius Maridianus, 44 B.C., it is a mere ornament of the reverse. The title may frequently be found in the literature. After Augusts,
                     the title disappears from coins, for there were no longer any moneyers engaged in striking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Functions.</hi> After the quaestor had fixed the quantity of metal to be coined and the denominations, it was the
                     business of the moneyer to carry out and supervise these directions. They had to control the technical work, check the correct production
                     of dies and attest the issues by their signature; to determine the number of pieces to be struck and to deliver the money to the <hi
                        rend="italic">aerarium.</hi> It was also their task to carry out the sytem of control by means of the issue marks introduced in Group 5.
                     Whenever money was issued from the store, they were responsible for its proper handling; that was their only function in the years in which
                     no coinage took place. They were likewise charged with the task of withdrawing coinage that was called in. As far as signature goes, we
                     have seen that, following the Athenian model, at first they used only symbols. Such symbols had been in use in <name type="place"
                        corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> from ancient times and represented the arms of the mint authorities (BMC. I. LXXXV). This is so
                     in Abdera (sixth to fifth centuries) in Corinth (fourth to third) and, as has been shown above, as true, after 229 B.C. in <name
                        type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. Head, LX, remarks: "Generally they are the personal signets of the magistrates
                     under whose authority the coins were issued." Soon afterwards came the names, âat first, only single letters or letters in ligature.
                     Gradually, them are written out the names more fully and finally all three names are inscribed. But ligatures continue for a long time and
                     single names occur until the end of the Republic. The signatures certainly illustrate the development of the Republican coinage and thus
                     offer a guide to the relative chronology.</p>
                  <p>The moneyers also gained an ever-increasing influence over the choice of types. The first types, that continued stereotyped so long, the
                     head of Bellona and the Dioscuri, were certainly prescribed by the supreme authority, the quaestor. But soon the stirring times, influenced
                     by Greek culture, forced their way through to expression. Tampilus, no. 6, shows a second reverse, Diana in biga, and drivers of quadrigae
                     become ever commoner. <name type="pname">Mattingly</name> places them in the age of the Gracchi. In Group 3 (cp. the Introduction to it) we
                     meet the first of the historical reverses. At first, they apply generally to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>âthe
                     oath-scene and the she-woff and twins, for example (nos. 22, 24), but later they are drawn from the histories of the families (nos. 29,
                     31). In Group 4, we meet for the first time a new obverse beside the head of Bellona, the head of Apollo (no. 37). From Group 5 on both
                     sides of the coin become more and more varied. They are related to the family history of the moneyers, and it is impossible, therefore, to
                     doubt that the moneyers had a free hand in the selection. From Group 8 on begin the contemporary allusions and the coinage concludes with
                     types restricted to the Emperor and his house.</p>
                  <pb n="64"/>
                  <p>The Special Coinages.</p>
                  <p>Since the moneyers shared in the special coinages, they must find their place here, There are three ways in which they may arise: 1. by
                     supplementary coinage; 2. by special coinage; 3. by a combination of the twoâ special supplementary coinages.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Supplementary Coinages.</hi> These usually appear, when a special denomination or metal begins to be in short supply.
                     They may be recognized by the fact that they do not fit into the normal sequence of coinages of a Group, as they usually have only one
                     denomination. Often, that denomination is an unusual one. One variety of supplementary coinage occurs as early as the second Group, where a
                     series of bronze is added in each case to one of denarius and bronze. True supplementary coinages take three forms: 1. An entirely new
                     college of triumviri strikes (as in nos. 5, 39, 40, 46â49, 83, 95, 96)). Twice, M<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">2</hi> are taken
                     over from the earlier college and only the third moneyer is replaced, clearly because one had dropped out (27A, 58, 90A); 2. The second
                     form shows a single moneyer, striking supplementarily. But which of the regular moneyers was in this way detached for the purpose cannot be
                     determined. (37, 57); 3. In the third variety, M<hi rend="sup">3</hi> has a second issue with new reverse types and new denomination (no.
                     6). Many variations are found when a supplementary issue takes place inside a college of triumviri. Such combinations have already been
                     noted above under the heading "Number of Moneyers." In no. 62 the three strike together, then each strikes, by way of supplement, alone. In
                     nos. 72 and 78 each strikes alone, then two strike, supplementarily, together. In no. 61, again, there is collegiate striking, followed by
                     a supplementary series without name, but with the types of the three. In no. 34, M<hi rend="sup">1</hi> has a supplementary coinage,
                     without his name certainly, but with the badge associated with him. We have already discussed the question whether these supplementary
                     coinages took place in the same year or later, under "Duration of Office."</p>
                  <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Special Coinages.</hi> Where a formula or a title of office, other than that of the moneyers, appears we must assume a
                     special coinage. It is provided for, as a rule, by a <hi rend="italic">senatus consultum.</hi> The only exception, in my opinion, is for
                     the coinage with <hi rend="italic">arg. pub.</hi> which were prescribed by a lex. The commonest formula is (EX)S C which sometimes occurs
                     alone, sometimes in connection with the title of a magistrate. But the mention of the office of the special commissioners is by itself
                     sufficient. I have only noted two exceptions. In no. 32 the two special issues with the new number <graphic url="NS7_sym49.jpg"/>, bear no
                     formula. Similarly, there is no formulation four of the issues of Volteius (no. 68), only the fifth one has S C DT.</p>
                  <p>Here again there are three ways in which the special formulae may be used: 1. S C alone; 2. title of official alone; 3. the two combined.
                     Where S C occurs alone, we cannot tell what office the special commissioner held. It might even be a moneyer in office, who had to execute
                     a special commission. Of the officials, it is naturally the quaestor that we meet first and most frequently âfive times, as Q<ref
                        target="#CH3-n30">30</ref> alone, twice as Q VR<ref target="#CH3-n31">31</ref> and four times with S. C. Next in order of time we find
                     the <hi rend="italic">aed. pleb.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">aed. cur.</hi> with S C occurs four or five times and once without S. C. It is
                     not surprising to find these officers entrusted with the task, since they held the <hi rend="italic">cura</hi> annonae<hi rend="italic"
                        >:</hi> the competences of the two classes of aedile <pb n="65"/> were, of course, very similar. Towards the close, the praetor occurs
                     once. This is very remarkable and I have already discussed it in dealing with <name type="place">Balbus</name> (no. 62). Finally, the <hi
                        rend="italic">praef. urbi</hi> are mentioned five times, three times with S C (cp. Introduction to Group g).<ref target="#CH3-n32"
                        >32</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Special supplementary coinages.</hi> There are whole colleges that issue supplementary coinages with a special
                     formula, as in nos. 57 A and 58 A, where M<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">2</hi> of the regular college of triumviri work on with
                     a new M<hi rend="sup">3</hi> and use the formula for <hi rend="italic">argentum publicum.</hi> So, too, in no. 60 A, we find a special
                     supplementary college of triumviri, made up out of two earlier colleges. In Group 7 the special colleges alternated with the regular one.
                     Of the triumviri in no. 85, three have a special coinage in gold with APF. In college 86, which is imperfect, the two moneyers have a
                     special series with S C, thus replating the two missing moneyers.</p>
                  <p>The question of how all these special coinages are related to the normal issues in point of time does not admit of any single answer. In
                     general, we can only assign such coinages to particular Groups. But there are two possibilities for more exact dating. In the case of
                     special supplementary coinage, the series will in each case have to be placed close in point of time to the regular coinage. Thus nos. 57
                     A, 60 A, 64, 66, 68 certainly belong to the years following the normal coinage, to which they are related. For nos. 72, 85 and 86, it must
                     be assumed that the special supplementary coinage followed in the same year. The second possibility lies in the fixing of special officials
                     in their place in history. Thus we have dates of 95 B.C. for Piso-Caepio (49) of 83â82 for <name type="place">Balbus</name> (62), of 70â69
                     for Galba and Plaetorius (77), of 58 for Scaurus and Hypsaeus, of 54 for Plautius and Plancus, of 53 B.C., in all probability, for <name
                        type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q1365457">Faustus Sulla</name> and Messalla, of 46 for Hirtius (80), of 45 for Plancius (81) and
                     probably for Cestius and Norbanus also and of 42 for Regulus, Clodius and Mussidius (85). But not all these dates, it must be admitted, are
                     certain.</p>
                  <p>The great variety of the special coinages proves that they were determined in accordance with the demands of the hour, according to any
                     such arrangements as were constitutionally admissible.</p>

                        the establishment of the moneyer's office, there was, of necessity, coinage each year, as may be seen in Groups 2. Further in Group 7
                        (Nos. 63â68) and Groups 9 and 10 (see the introduction to these groups). For the other groups, or portions thereof, it is not possible
                        to determine to what extent there was continuity of striking. Likewise, in general, we cannot say whether the special issues served to
                        fill gaps between the regular issues.</p>

               </head>
               <p>As we have already seen from the inscriptions (p. 8) the title of moneyer was still used, as late as the third century A.D., with the addition
                  of the full AAAFF. Diverse guesses have been made about the functions of these moneyers. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825"
                     >Mommsen</name>, who introduced a dyarchy into the coinage (StR. III. 1146) believed that the senate struck bronze, but under imperial
                  control (StR. II. 1028). He cites as evidence (MW. 745) the fact that Otho and Pescennius Niger had no issues of bronze. In the case of Otho,
                  who only reigned from January 15th to April 17th, it is hard to say whether the lack of bronze really depends on the senate. Scholars, who
                  believe in a senatorial coinage of bronze under the Empire, adopt this argument (e.g., RIC. I. CCXIX), but it is always a dubious proceeding
                  to draw any general conclusion from such isolated cases, which might have their explanation in the disturbances in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>. In the case of Pescennius Niger the matter is clear. In the provincial mints of the East, which can be
                  traced from Pescennius onwards âhe himself struck in Antioch âbronze is never struck, for the Emperor, as a general, struck only precious
                  metals. On the other hand, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name>, in contrast to Hirschfeld 183 (though he once shared
                  his view, MW. 745), admits that the moneyers had nothing to do with the imperial coinage. As regards their share in the senatorial coinage, he
                  writes (StR. 602): "Ob sie (die Mon.) mit der spï¿½teren senatorischen an Unternehmer verdungenen Kupferprï¿½gung zu tun hatten, ist unbekannt."
                  Regling, however, (SWM., "S C") rejects the dyarchy on the coinage and for very good reasons. He points out that the imperial officials,
                  also), mention all the metals in their title and that almost all the coins with S C bear the head of the Emprror.<ref target="#CH3-n33"
                     >33</ref> Since the moneyers, for their part. very often have the full title AAAFF on the inscriptions, we must conclude that it is now a
                  mere title. Such a development is not unusual in the history of a title. Perhaps the whole XXvirate under the Empire was little more than a
                  form (StR. II. 601, on IIIviri capitals)).</p>

                  <p>Yet Regling (SWM., p. 706 "Triumvir etc.") still is inclined to rank the moneyers as supervisors of the whole coinage. But this view must
                     be rejected. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> (StR. II. 1927, note 3) extricates himself from this difficulty
