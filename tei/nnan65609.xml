            </head>
            <p>Three hundred years ago on the 11th of June, 1652, a coinage for the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> Bay
               Colony was authorized in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> The coins which were struck
               under this authorization have since come to be known generally and collectively as Pine Tree Shillings although all the trees were not Pine and
               all of the coins were not shillings. In the charter given the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> colonists, a
               provision for coinage had been made, but no such grant had been made to the Bay colony. <name type="pname">Charles</name> I had been executed in
               1649, and <name type="pname">Charles</name> II was defeated at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2633563">Worcester</name> in 1651. It is
               possible that some understanding with <name type="pname">Cromwell</name> was reached by the colonists, but if such be the case, no record of it
               is extant today. All this was changed with the restoration of <name type="pname">Charles</name> II. As the coins, with the exception of the
               twopence, were all dated 1652, which was within a year of the royal exile, the colonists were open to the charge of having infringed the royal
               prerogative. Since the coinage was not stopped immediately, there is some vraisemblance to the familiar tale that <name type="pname">Sir Thomas
                  Temple</name> modified the royal displeasure by explaining "that the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name>
               people, not daring to put his majesty's name on their coin, during the late troubles, had impressed upon it the emblem of the oak which preserved
               his majesty's life."<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Boston in 1652 was a little over twenty years old. The settlement can scarcely have extended far from the waterfront. The inclement weather
               contributed to epidemics which brought much sorrow and hardship to the settlers. Added to these very real difficulties was a pressing lack of
               sufficient currency to supply the needs of the town. To meet this situation, the authorities of the colony resolved to establish a mint. For
               carrying out their plans, they chose <name type="pname">John Hull</name> as mintmaster and <name type="pname">Robert Sanderson</name> as his
               assistant. It speaks well for both of these men that no complaint is on record as to the performance of their duties.</p>
            <p>Even a brief summary of the public services of <name type="pname">John Hull</name> would require considerable space. In two earlier monographs it
               was assumed that these would be known to readers; it seems fitting, however, that they be reviewed here even though some of the statements may be
               familiar. For many of these we owe an exceptionally full record to a diary kept by <name type="pname">Hull</name> which has been preserved, as
               well as to his letter-books and accountbooks from which a clear picture of this early patriot may be constructed. The diary was published in 1857
               by The American Antiquarian Society (its present owner) and has served most of the historians of this period since that year.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Approaching <name type="pname">Hull</name> from another side of his activities, <name type="pname">Hermann Frederick Clarke</name> has published
               a volume devoted chiefly to <name type="pname">Hull's</name> work as a <name type="pname">silversmith</name>. This excellent study modestly
               disclaims originality, but it very conveniently brings together the more important data concerning <name type="pname">Hull's</name> life and does
               not neglect their setting. Pertinent documents are quoted and <pb n="3"/> references helpfully given. One chapter is devoted to his
               mintmastership.</p>
            <p>About <name type="pname">Robert Sanderson</name>, chosen by him as partner at the mint, as we learn from <name type="pname">Hull's</name> diary,
               we know very little as compared with <name type="pname">Hull</name>. Much of the silver that has been identified as having been produced in the
               shop of <name type="pname">Hull</name> and <name type="pname">Sanderson</name> bears the separate punchmarks of both of them. A single piece
               bears <name type="pname">Hull's</name> punch alone. Four bear the sole mark of <name type="pname">Sanderson</name> and are believed by <name
                  type="pname">Clarke</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> to have been produced after the partnership ceased. <name type="pname">Hull</name> died in 1683, but <name
                  type="pname">Sanderson</name> survived until 1693. It seems, and with much probability in view of <name type="pname">Hull's</name> official
               and business engagements, that <name type="pname">Sanderson</name> was responsible for the details and that supervision and planning were <name
                  type="pname">Hull's</name> responsibility.</p>
            <p>Today, the four groups into which the coinage under <name type="pname">Hull</name> and <name type="pname">Sanderson</name> is divided are well
               known to almost every American numismatist. It is also generally known that they were placed in their correct order by <name type="pname"
                  >Sylvester S. Crosby</name> whose <hi rend="italic">Early Coins of America and the Laws Governing 'Their Issue</hi>, published in 1875, is the
               rock-like foundation for any study of the early coinage of our country.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> In a previous study, the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> and Willow Tree Coinages of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926"
                     >Massachusetts</name>
               </hi>, the employment of methods not known in Crosby's day showed that the cryptic inscriptions on the Willow Tree issues, which seem to have
               puzzled Crosby and his contempararies, were due to double or triple strikings and that only three obverse and five reverse dies were up to that
               writing (1943) distinguishable — a valuable criterion in estimating the length of the period during which the Willow Tree coins were struck.</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>In a subsequent study, <hi rend="italic">The Oak Tree Coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name>
               </hi>, it was demonstrated that the cause of the irregularities in the striking of the Willow Tree coins must have been due to the use of
               cylindrical dies whose freedom to rotate produced the repeated letters of the inscriptions and the double or triple impresses of the designs.
               This condition was remedied by employing dies whose shape was prismoidal, i.e., dies with four, six or eight sides which permitted them to be
               clamped so that the die would not rotate. The impress of these straight-edged dies was found on the Oak Tree issues, while the die-impress on the
               Willow Tree coins was circular. This innovation may have been coupled with the use of a screw-press. As a result, the Oak Tree issues were
               excellent coins for their period and sustain comparison with most contemporary European coinages. A tentative ordering for the Oak Tree varieties
               somewhat modified that presented by Crosby. The present study takes up the last of the four coin-types, the Pine Tree.</p>
            <p>The Pine Tree shillings are the best known of the issues of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> Bay Colony,
               and because this was the latest and the most prolific of the four forms, the entire coinage has been given this designation. Crosby states that
               the earliest reference to the coins by this name occurs in an application to the General Court which is dated 1680.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We do find reference to "Boston or Bay Colony" shillings, however, and this would be a collective term, applying to any of the forms, whether NE,
               Willow, Oak or Pine. The great need for small denominations made these coins popular beyond the confines of the Bay Colony, for we have acts
               passed by certain of the islands of the West Indies giving them currency.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> The cargoes of salted fish from Boston
               found a ready sale in these <pb n="5"/> islands, and the coins of the Bay Colony would have had ample occasion for transmission to such markets.
               It was from the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3571219">West Indies</name>, and more probably Jamaica, that the supply of silver was
               obtained. Here was offered such loot as pirates or privateers might capture from the Spanish shipping to or from the ports of <name type="place"
                  >Mexico</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</name>, among which silver was a prominent commodity. It seems
               probable also that it was here that the much prized Spanish iron or steel used for the dies of these coins may have been obtained, since the bog
               iron produced in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> is thought to have been too poor in quality for this
               purpose.</p>
            <p>The appended plates showing the varieties of the Pine Tree issues display at a glance one condition which greatly simplifies their study. They
               divide themselves very conveniently into two groups: the first, and the earlier, have the enlarged, thin flan which marks most of the Oak Tree
               issues which precede; the second, have a much smaller and more constricted planchet (24–27 mm.). These must, therefore, have been the latest
               issues in the coinage as is made evident from a consideration of the hoards which are known.</p>
            <p>In our "Descriptive Notes" the form of the inscriptions is given, together with distinguishing characteristics of each die. The plates and
               Crosby's table reproduced on Plates <ref target="#fig-76">IX</ref> and <ref target="#fig-77">X</ref> supply other pertinent details. The best
               preserved specimens available have been chosen for illustration; their present ownership and weight is recorded also.</p>

            <p>Establishing a date for the initiation of the Pine Tree type offers difficulties, but a careful study of the documents printed by Crosby permits
               deductions which are helpful though not entirely conclusive. We have a copy of the court order for the minting of the twopence under date of May
               16th, 1662.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> This provides for the coining of this denomination for the next seven years and stipulates the
               proportion of twopence to the total coinage — a consideration of value in estimating the extent of the entire output. The term of seven years
               seems to have become an <hi rend="italic">id�e fixe</hi> of the authorities for, as we shall see, it occurs in at least two later agreements
               between them and <name type="pname">John Hull</name> and <name type="pname">Robert Sanderson</name>. According to the arrangement made in 1662,
               there would have been no coinage of this denomination after 1669, but Crosby reasons convincingly from the alterations made to the reverse
                  die<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> and because of the smallness of the dies, that it was struck for a longer period. We can therefore hardly
               take 1669 as the date for the change from the Oak to the Pine Tree types. I believe that we have means for reaching greater certainty by working
               backward from the date on which all coining stopped at this mint. The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> Records
               afford us another document recording the negotiations of a Committee of the Court with "the former master of the mint" because "the time formerly
               agreed upon with the mint masters is now expired." <name type="pname">Hull</name> and <name type="pname">Sanderson</name> are enjoined to
               "Continue to mint what Silver bulljon shall Come in for the seven <pb n="7"/> yeares next to Come, if either of them live so long." The date of
               this agreement is May 12th, 1675, which would make its expiration date May 12th, 1682. Crosby quotes a letter<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> from
               the officials of the King's Mint found at the State Paper Office in London under date of Nov. 22, 1684, with the statement "that a mint hath
               hitherto been kept up and employed at Boston in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name>," and another reference which
               makes provisions "if his Majesty shall think fitt to settle a Mint in N. E." It seems certain that coinage must have stopped before 1684, and the
               expiration of <name type="pname">Hull's</name> agreement in May of 1682 is hardly likely to have been extended appreciably beyond this date.
                  <name type="pname">Hull</name> died October 1, 1683. The Charter of the colony was revoked Oct. 23, 1684.</p>
            <p>If there was an interval between the large-flan Pine Tree coins and those which are smaller and thicker, it can hardly have been extensive in
               time, but there is support for the suggestion in the agreement with the mint masters which precedes the one which we have just been considering.
               This is dated October 9th, 1667, and like the two others which have been quoted, covers a period of seven years.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
               This period would have expired in October of 1674, and that there was any coining between that date and July 9th, 1775, when the new agreement
               with "the former mint masters" was signed, seems unlikely in the light of the explicitness which marks both the procedure of the Court and <name
                  type="pname">Hull</name> and <name type="pname">Sanderson's</name> business-like way of doing things. In view of the wording quoted, there
               would seem to have been in 1674–5 at least a possibility that the former mint masters might not continue to be in charge.</p>
            <p>Crosby makes the very probable suggestion that the decrease in diameter may have been due to the discovery that small dies lasted longer than the
               ones required for the larger <pb n="8"/> flans and that this was the cause of the constriction. Does it not seem that this innovation must have
               been decided upon in 1675 ? And does it not follow that the introduction of the Pine Tree type on the larger–flan issues may have been decided
               upon at the beginning of the term of the previous agreement — that is, in 1667. Such a dating would seem to accommodate itself very well to the
               proportionate number of dies, although any such comparison must take into account an apparent increase in the small-flan coinage (which is to be
               seen in the diagram on page 12). We must also ask whether there may not have been a temporary stoppage of coining of the Oak Tree pieces in 1665
               following upon receipt of the demand of the King's Commissioners that the law providing for the coinage be repealed. From the foregoing, I think
               we are justified in rejecting Crosby's tentative dating of 1662 for the introduction of the Pine Tree type.</p>
            <p>With the plate of the large-flan Pine Tree shillings before one, it is easier to follow the reasoning which dictated the arrangement here
               submitted. Crosby's ordering was based on the punctuation on the obverse die (p. 55 and Table on pages 56–7, reproduced on <hi rend="smallcaps"
                  >Plates</hi> IX and X of this monograph). The sizes given by him are for the diameters of the inner and outer circles of beads and are, as was
               to have been expected from a man who was also a student of astronomy, accurate. But he does not start with the largest dies which his Table gives
               as 3 and 4. (Nos. 2 and 3, herein). For both of these, the diameters of the beaded circles are larger than for any of the Oak Tree shillings, the
               last of which has an oval rather than a circular border with the vertical axis longer than the horizontal. For the latest Oak Tree issues, the
               flans as well as the dies are smaller than for our Nos. 1 to 3 of the Pine Tree coins. There would seem to have been a new beginning.</p>
            <p>This, however, is not the only reason for the changed order.</p>
            <pb n="9"/>
            <p>The tree forms of Nos. 13 to 15 are much nearer the simplified forms of the later small-flan shillings shown on the following plates, from which
               our Nos. 1 to 3 are furthest removed in point of form or style. The transition from Nos. 1 to 15 is gradual and shows a consistent tendency. The
               die-combinations provide further support for the sequence as submitted. They show that there were three combinations — Nos. 2–3 (Crosby 3F and
               4F), Nos. 4–7 (Crosby 5B and 7B) and Nos. 8–10 (Crosby 1C and 1D). Of these, the tree-form of No. 7 seems to have been a derivative of No. 2 with
               a trend away from the straight branches of the former toward the curved ones of Nos. 8–10.</p>
            <p>Because the recutting of the last die of the Oak Tree shillings (Nos. 13 and 14) seems to try to make a Pine out of an Oak Tree, this may have
               occurred after 1667 when <name type="pname">Hull's</name> new agreement with the authorities was ratified. Reason for rejecting Crosby's variety
               IOP will be presented later. Without the altered Oak Tree die (14), we should then have eight obverse and seven reverse dies for these large flan
               Pine Tree shillings, struck, as has been suggested, between 1667 and 1674.</p>
            <p>The last group of the Pine Tree coins, which we have shown may with some assurance be dated between 1675 and 1682 are more common than the
               earlier pieces and show less marked differences. The diagram appended shows one striking contrast. Whereas previously a new die was not prepared
               until the old one had been outworn, or nearly so, we have now clear indication that not less than four pairs of dies <hi rend="italic">may</hi>
               have been in use at the same time. Whether the tale that the Oak Tree on the coins was intended for the royal oak did satisfy <name type="pname"
                  >Charles</name> II to the extent that there was no agitation for suppressing the mint for a number of years following this incident is a moot
               question. But by 1675, or shortly thereafter, when <name type="pname">Hull's</name> last <pb n="10"/> seven-year agreement with the colony was
               effected, there must have been a realization on his part and on the part of the Bay State authorities that there was strong likelihood that
               further minting would be forbidden. And since there could be no denial that a mint had been operating, their conviction on this count was sure.
               No benefit would be derived from minimizing the offense. The indications point to a decision to increase the coinage to the limit. Small-sized
               flans withstand the stresses of coining better than spread ones, and there would have been a longer life for each pair of dies and a consequent
               increase in the number of coins produced by each pair. There seems the best of reasons to believe that the output of the mint in this last period
               was greater than in any that had preceded.</p>
            <p>There is, however, another possibility. In a Minute of the Court dated October 10th, 1677, "It is ordered that the Tresurer doe forthwith prouide
               tenn barrells of Cranburyes, two hogsheads of special Good Sampe, and three thousand of Cod ffish, to be sent to our messengers, by them to be
               presented to his Majesty as A present from this Court.' An entry in Hull's letter book shows that part of this provender was sent in the ship
               "Blessing" to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> agents of the colony, <name type="pname">William Stoughton</name>
               and <name type="pname">Peter Bulkley</name>. In October of 1678, the Court writes to the same agents "As for that particular of our Coyning money
                  w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ou<hi rend="sup">r</hi> oune Impress, His Maj<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> of his Gratious Clemency towards us hath not binn
               pleased as yet to declare his pleasure therein; and wee haue Confidence that when he shall truely be informed of the symplicity of our Actings,
               the publicke Joy thereof to his subjects here, and the great damage that the stoppage thereof will Inevitably be to ou<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               necessary Comerce and abatement of his Maj<hi rend="sup">tjes</hi> Customes yearely Acruing by ou<hi rend="sup">r</hi> merchants &amp;
               Nauigation, &amp; is pajd at London, his maj<hi rend="sup">tye</hi> will not Account those to be freinds to his Croune that shall seeke to
               Interrupt us therein; and for the Impress put <pb n="11"/> vpon it wee shall take it as his maj<hi rend="sup">tjes</hi> signall ouning vs if he
               will please to order such an Impresse as shall be to him most Acceptable."</p>
            <p>This shows clearly that hope of obtaining the royal permission had not yet been abandoned and a report by the agents of a seemingly favorable
               response might have resulted in an authorization to Hull and Sanderson to increase the output of the mint. The former explanation, however, seems
               the more probable.</p>
            <p>Justifying the arrangement submitted for the small flan issues is much more difficult than might be expected. In the previous pages an effort has
               been made to show that there was a considerable increase in the output of the mint during the last seven years of Hull's incumbency. There may
               have been four pairs of dies in active use at the same time, possibly more. The combinations with the four reverse dies form an entity, albeit a
               complicated one. In the present ordering, No. 15 (Crosby 24-N) precedes. The reasons for this placement are technical and stylistic. The pine
               tree here seems to have been copied from No. 11 (Crosby 2a-Al), and the reduced size of the letters of the inscription on that die is followed on
               both dies of this variety. The neatly formed letters and the exceptionally large interval between the last S of MASATHVSETS and IN seem to
               indicate an engraver new to his task. So, too, do such inadvertencies as the lowered L of <name type="place">ENGLAND</name> on the reverse and
               the spacing of AN DO. The rather unhappy form of the 5 of the date is open to the same interpretation and the spacing of the beads of the
               borders, though careful, appears to be timid. All these conditions are greatly improved in the dies which follow and would be less reasonably
               explainable if this variety were placed after the complex of the combinations which follow. Moreover, the form of the tree does not fit there as
               well as here. Crosby placed this piece at the end of the <pb n="12"/> series because he used the rosettes of the obverse as the criterion for his
               order.</p>
            <p>The arrangement for Nos. 16 to 22 is determined by the wear on the reverse die (Crosby's L). One can hardly be certain that this order is
               absolutely as given because it is easy to confuse the wear on a given coin with the wear on the die, but if the demonstration that these dies
               were in use concurrently be accepted, it follows that no great difference in point of time will be involved. In his introductory paragraph for
               the series, Crosby remarks regarding the Pine Tree issues "This type furnishes at least twenty-four obverse dies of the Shilling, or about double
               the number of both Willows and Oaks, and are met within about the proportion of four of these to one of those." As between the large-flan Pine
               Tree shillings and those of the smaller and thicker flans, the latter appear to be much the more numerous.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-3">
               <graphic url="NNM125_012.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>If, as the combinations show, four pairs of dies may have been in use concurrently, the relative order within the complex is of comparatively
               slight importance. Taking Crosby's L <pb n="13"/> die as the earliest (our Nos. 16-22), we can show that L precedes die Q through the progression
               of die flaws (cf. obverses of Nos. 20 and 27). There is not enough indication of wear to show whether No. 21 (16-L) preceded No. 23 (16-M) or <hi
                  rend="italic">vice versa</hi>. The doubled V,s (for W) of the reverse inscription of No. 23 and the improved circle of the inner border might
               be taken to indicate the order 20–23 (L-M). As between Nos. 23 and 24, the doubled Vs of the reverse link it to No. 23 rather than No. 24 so the
               order submitted (L-M-O) seems highly probable. No. 26 definitely follows No. 25 because of the development of the die-flaw at the last N. Placing
               No. 29 (Crosby 14-R) and No. 30 (Crosby 13-S) at the end of the coinage is based on the development of the tree-form and inscriptional tendencies
               although the condition that the reverse die of No. 25 is not combined with more than one other die may point to O having followed Q.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">HOARDS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>There are two hoards which are recorded with some degree of dependability. The first was found in Roxbury in 1863. This hoard contained
               twenty-eight pieces and was acquired intact by <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodward</name>, a <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston"
                  >Boston</name> coin-dealer. It was described in his catalogue of the <name type="pname">McCoy</name> Collection (1864, lot 1640) and offered
               as a single lot with an upset price of $150.00 and withdrawn in the absence of a bid. In his next sale, the following year, the coins were
               offered without restriction and brought a total which was close to one hundred dollars. Had the hoard been preserved intact, helpful deductions
               would have been possible in all probability. An account of the finding was printed in <hi rend="italic">The Historical Magazine</hi> for October,
               1863, from which the following is taken:</p>
            <p>"A few weeks since <name type="pname">Geo. Wilber Reed</name>, a little son of <name type="pname">Geo. P. Reed, Esq.</name>, of this city, when
               climbing up a bank, through which a new street had recently been cut, to aid his ascent put his hand into a crevice by the side of a rock; on
               withdrawing his hand his attention was attracted by a piece of metal, which on examination he found to be a Pine Tree Shilling, with two other
               coins adhering. The boy of course continued "prospecting" until the "lead" was exhausted, and at the conclusion of his digging was rewarded by
               finding in his possession no less than twenty-eight pieces, comprising all the denominations of the Pine Tree money, all of the common types with
               a single exception.</p>
            <p>"..... That the coins were not lost prior to 1662 is proved by the fact that several two-penny pieces of that date were found amongst them, while
               the fine condition of the pieces, <pb n="15"/> coupled with the circumstances that no Spanish or other coins were with them, indicate that they
               were lost when the Mint was in its palmy days, and when the Pine Tree money was almost or quite the only currency in circulation in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name>, say, between 1662 and 1685."</p>
            <p>In this hoard, sixteen coins were Oak and twelve Pine Tree issues. We are able to identify one of the Pine Tree shillings (our No. 11), and
               possibly a second (No. 3 ?). At least one of the remaining shillings was of the small-flan type — possibly all four — the insufficient
               description prevents certainty. But the presence of the one small-flan shilling enables us to date the burial of the hoard after the small-flan
               came into use, after about 1675. Were we able to identify the other varieties, we might be able to tell from them whether the loss of these coins
               took place immediately after the change to the small form or nearer to the cessation of the coinage in 1682.</p>
            <p>The second hoard was found at <name type="place">Castine</name> on the coast of Maine in 1840. It was initially studied by <name type="pname">Mr.
                  Joseph Williamson</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> A re-study of this hoard<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> was one of the results of the
               loan of this material for an exhibition held in the <name type="place">Museum</name> of the American Numismatic Society in 1942.</p>
            <p>The hoard is reported to have contained between four and five hundred pieces. The Massachusetts issues were said to have numbered thirty in one
               account and fifty to seventy-five in another description of this hoard. Fortunately, a selection of what purported to be one of each several
               variety contained in the hoard was made by <name type="pname">Dr. Joseph L. Stevens</name> of <name type="place">Castine</name>, and this
               selection of seventeen pieces came ultimately into possession of the <name type="place">Maine Historical Society</name>. There are four Pine Tree
               varieties. The date deduced for the burial of the <pb n="16"/> deposit was about 1704. The three Pine Tree shillings are our Nos. 2, 25 and 29;
               there was also a sixpence. Specimens said to be from this hoard occur in auction sale catalogues,<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> an indication of
               the possibility that more of these pieces than we think escaped the melting pot.</p>
            <p>At Exeter in October, 1876, a hoard said to have contained thirty to forty <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name>
               shillings was found. A brief paragraph appeared in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> for 1877 (p. 92), and a much more
               detailed account in the same publication for 1878 (p. 105) is signed C.H.B., probably <name type="pname">C. H. Betts</name>. Since many of our
               readers will not have this reference available, two pertinent paragraphs are appended.</p>
            <p>"It was in the process of excavating a cellar under the extension of a store, not far from the railroad station, in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_2649808">Exeter</name>, that the discovery of the coins was made. The Proprietor had given the earth to an Irish laborer,
               upon the condition that he would take it away. In throwing the sand into a cart, a few of the shillings were disclosed, though their value was
               not at once realized. The person to whom the earth was given, however, thought it worth his while to examine further the argentiferous soil
               before "dumping" it, and finally passed it through a sieve, realizing by the process quite a store of the pine-tree pieces. The exact number
               obtained in all cannot be ascertained, but is believed to be between thirty and forty. The greater part were found by the Irishman, but other
               persons picked up scattering specimens.</p>
            <p>"The remains of what appeared to be a wooden box, much decayed, were detected in the sand; the coins in all probability had been inclosed in it.
               All the pieces found were shillings of the oak or pine-tree pattern, and bearing the date, of course, <pb n="17"/> of 1652. They were of several
               varieties, giving evidence, according to an intelligent informant, of at least four distinct dies. The condition of the pieces varied, some
               being, fine, while others were much worn. The place of deposit has been used as a garden, or door yard, probably, for a couple of centuries.
               When, by whom, and for what reason the glittering hoard was interred there, must be left to conjecture."</p>
            <p>We do not have any detailed record of the contents of this find, but in the Ferguson Haines Sale of October, 1880, there is a statement that the
               Willow Tree shilling, No. 11 in N. N. &amp; M., No. 102, came from this source.</p>
            <p>From Salem in 1737, comes a newspaper report of a find which bears all the marks of gross exaggeration. It was called to my attention by <name
                  type="pname">Mr. Chauncey C. Nash</name> who kindly made inquiries in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5750162">Salem</name> without
               being able to obtain further information. The paragraph quoted by him comes from the <name type="pname">
                  <hi rend="italic">Salem Gazette</hi>
               </name> for July 11/18, 1737. A similarly worded paragraph (with minor differences) appears in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of
                  Numismatics</hi> for 1881 (p. 46) and is repeated (without original spellings) in the same Journal for 1890 (p. 31) with credit to the <hi
                  rend="italic">Boston Weekly News-Letter</hi> of July 21st, 1737. Although little more than a statement of place and circumstance is to be
               gained from this paragraph, it is reprinted below:</p>
            <p>"We hear from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5750162">Salem</name>, that on Friday last <name type="pname">William Brown, Esq.</name>, the

               owned, caused search to be made for the same, where was found five or six <name type="place">Jarrs</name> full of Silver, containing about one
               thousand ninety-three Ounces of Silver of several Species, among which was about six thousand <name type="place">New-England</name> Shillings,
               scarcely discolor'd." <hi rend="italic">Boston Weekly News-Letter</hi>, July 21, 1737.</p>
            <pb n="18"/>
            <p>Coming from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4958964">Boothbay Harbor</name>, thirteen miles southeast of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_4957582">Bath</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4971068">Maine</name>, sometime before September, 1880, a small
               lot of "Pine Tree" pieces which might have been a part of a hoard is recorded in the Woodward Sale of the Jenks Collection (Sept. 1880), lots 429
               to 431. The fifth piece appeared in Woodward's Sale of his own collection (1884, lot 354). The earlier sale under a caption "Treasure Trove"
               states "the four following pieces were found, quite recently, in a small cave in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4958964">Boothbay
                  Harbor</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4971068">Maine</name>. The entire find consisted of five pieces, and the finder, hopeing
               to secure more, very judiciously keeps secret the exact place of discovery." The entry for the piece in the 1884 sale reads: "1652 Oak-tree
               Shilling. Found in a little cave with a number of others at <name type="place">Boothbay, Me.</name>, where it had lain long under salt water, the
               action of which reduced its weight nearly one-half. Piece broken from edge." There is little to be learned from the foregoing save that there
               were two Oak Tree shillings, and that one of the three Pine Tree shillings was a small-flan variety. Assuming that a hoard is represented by
               these five pieces, it would have been deposited after about 1675.</p>

            </head>
            <p>One of the tragic episodes in the early history of the Bay Colony — the witch frenzy — has an indirect bearing on the coinage we have been
               studying. A wave of hysteria seems to have swept over the colonists in 1692, centering in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5750162"
                  >Salem</name> although Boston was not unaffected. The cruel punishments after trials that were grossly unjust still bring amazement to anyone
               who examines the carefully kept records. The epidemic was not confined to the ignorant or illiterate. <name type="pname">Cotton Mather</name>
               attended one of the trials and spoke in justification of the verdict. He also made his opinion clear in print. Judge <name type="pname">Samuel
                  Sewall</name>, later Chief Justice, twenty years after made a public confession of penitence for his judicial acts.<ref target="#CH4-n1"
                  >1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We are told that it was the superstitious belief of the time that wearing a bent coin afforded protection against the power of "witches." Some of
               our Pine Tree coins show evidence of having once been bent even though as we see them now they have again been flattened. Some show dents which
               imply that teeth must have been the means of bending them initially. The thinness of the Pine Tree coins made bending an easy operation, and some
               with holes for suspension may have seen service in the same manner as those which were bent. The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4977088"
                  >Roxbury</name> hoard contained one piece which was described as a witch piece. On <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, a-c, a selection of

            <p>The manner in which these coins were prepared is of interest, but the only evidence I have found is that provided by the coins themselves, and
               this is frequently clouded by wear and mutilation. A number of the better preserved pieces have edges that are straight for a part of the
                  circumference<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> and some of these straight edges have a bevel which implies the use of a chisel or some similar
               means of having produced that straight edge. But by far the greater portion of these pieces — even those with a straight edge of considerable
               length — have the most of their perimeter so curved that it could hardly have been formed by chisel cuts. Is it possible that a huge pair of
               shears might have produced the results we now see ? Trial and error would soon show the size of flan which would give the desired weight, and any
               excess could be removed by further clipping. The longer straight-edges would be understandable in such a process. There is too much irregularity
               for thinking that a circular cutting tool such as we use today for making discs or washers could have been used. A hammer blow, once the flan had
               been placed on a flat surface, would easily have removed any bending incidental to the shearing.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">ENGRAVING</hi>
            </head>
            <p>In our monographs devoted to the coinage of the Bay Colony, there has been frequent reference to the workmanship or die-cutting. In a very real
               sense it has been more like engraving than cutting intaglio such as one would have had for a Greek coin. The contemporaneous European issues such
               as those of the mother <name type="place">country or Spain</name>, where the artist had to essay portraiture and the intricacies of
               coats-of-arms, were much more demanding. The tree type was as much engraving as the letters of the inscriptions, and neither produced any great
               relief on the coins. In the beginning, in all likelihood, this work would have fallen to the lot of <name type="pname">Robert Sanderson</name>.
               There are statements in <hi rend="italic">The History of Lynn</hi>
               <ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> that the dies were <hi rend="italic">made</hi> by <name type="pname">Joseph Jenks</name> of that town, and
                  Crosby<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> states that "it is supposed it was he who cut many of the dies for the coinage of this mint." May it not
               be that the making of the dies did not involve their engraving? Jenks may have <hi rend="italic">made</hi> the dies, but there seems no good
               reason for attributing their engraving or cutting to an iron-founder.</p>
            <p>There are notable differences in the forms of the letters as well as errors in spelling that were palpably due to copying. Knowing as we do that
                  <name type="pname">Hull</name> had several apprentices, possibly including <name type="pname">John Coney</name> who in 1690 engraved the first
               Massachusetts paper money,<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref> we need hardly hesitate in concluding <pb n="22"/> that some of the engraving was done by
               apprentices. The errors in spelling occur rather late (Nos. 11 and 12, obverses), but the uniform spelling MASATHVSETS, with these exceptions,
               gives some authority to this as an official spelling, notwithstanding the multiplicity of variations which occur in documents, and sometimes in
               the same document.</p>
            <p>The frequency with which we find reversed S's, and N's which have the middle stroke incorrectly cut, shows that either a novice or a careless
               workman was responsible. ANNO was usually abbreviated to AN, but in the Pine Tree threepences we find ANO. Further we find it omitted in one
               instance (<ref target="#fig-42">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 34</ref>) and then added to a second state of the die with a readjustment of the adjacent letters to
               equalize the spacing (<ref target="#fig-43">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 35</ref>). If the forthrightness which characterizes Hull's letters found vent after the disclosure of such
               inadvertencies, there must have been times when the mint-house echoed to forceful language.</p>
            <p>It must not be thought, however, that such mistakes were common. After mastering the difficulties which made the Willow Tree pieces such poor
               coins, the inscriptions are exceptional in their excellence, and need no apologist. It is doubtful that anything would be gained through trying
               to differentiate the workmanship of this or that engraver. The silverware bearing the punches of Hull and Sanderson show little lettered
               engraving that is not obviously a later addition. For the purpose of establishing the sequence, the numismatic approach through die-combinations
               and die-breaks is relatively much more dependable.</p>

            <p>There are other pieces which seem to have been clipped, but which the scales show to be of normal weight. Some pieces have lost a few grains only
               and these can hardly have suffered this loss by clipping. In addition, we are fortunate in having a <pb n="24"/> clipping from an Oak Tree
               shilling. This comes from a hoard of clippings found in London. The letters permit identifying it as our No. 1. In some cases, as in this one,
               clipping has taken the form of removing a segment (<ref target="#fig-24">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, c</ref>). Others have had a ring of metal removed (Cf. <ref target="#fig-81">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, a</ref>, <ref target="#fig-82">b</ref>),<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> and this procedure is a less obvious
               reduction of the coin's value. Both large and small flan issues have suffered from this practice, but the larger flan pieces which had undergone
               circular clipping would have been more easily passed after the small-flan Pine Tree pieces had come into being. A further form of mutilation has
               been published by H. Alexander Parsons.<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> This is a quartering of a Pine Tree shilling (<ref target="#fig-47">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, b</ref>) which probably occurred in the Leeward Islands of the <name type="place"

               or other coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7730009">Latin America</name>. It is interesting that <name type="pname">Mr. Howland
                  Wood</name> whose interest in cut pieces is commemorated in his indispensable monograph on these mutilations, concurred in this explanation.
               The halved piece from the collection of The Massachusetts Historical Society (No. 26 — <ref target="#fig-49">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, d</ref>) may be another instance of this practice although it may also have been the result of a coin
               having been bent for wear as a witch piece and broken in the process.</p>
            <p>Overweight is rare and is sometimes a valuable hint that the genuineness of a coin is questionable. All weights above the norm recorded have been
               for Pine Trees.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">COMMENTS ON FABRICATIONS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>From the space devoted to counterfeits and imitations herein, they may appear to have been given undue prominence, but because some of these
               fabrications may be dated within fairly close limits and also because the copies are frequently mistaken for the genuine pieces by the
               uninitiated who have no originals with which to compare them, they are listed with more detail than they deserve.</p>
            <p>A, B and C. These pieces are to be dated before 1854 on the evidence of <name type="pname">Dr. Ammi Brown's</name> letter.<ref target="#CH8-n1"
                  >1</ref> The spelling MASSACHUSETS implies that the engraver did not have a genuine piece before him. Moreover, the date shows that the
               intention must have been either to mystify or to take advantage of the ignorance of some novice.</p>
            <p>The source of B and C was the same as for A, and because these pieces betray a knowledge of the Bay Colony's coinage, which, though hardly to be
               called thorough or competent could not be stigmatized as superficial, we may draw some conclusions from what was selected for imitation. Their
               fabricator was not concerned with the Oak Tree issues. He was working at a time when Crosby's demonstration that the Oak Tree type preceded the
               Pine Tree had not yet been published. It seems scarcely credible that the very slight evidence that a coinage was being considered by the
               officials of the colony before 1652, on the basis of which Crosby and others were willing to give these pieces a hearing, could have been known
               to the originator. He did not know that the small-flan Pine Tree pieces were the latest in the coinage, but the <pb n="26"/> use of flans for B
               and C that were smaller than A shows that he was aware that the flans did differ in size. The maker of these coins must have had some numismatic
               knowledge for the intention seems to have been to offer his product as "patterns." If it had not been for the backing which the respectability of
                  <name type="pname">Dr. Ammi Brown</name> afforded, the tale which accounts for the origin of these coins would have been given less
               credence.</p>
            <p>D. It is breaking with tradition to place this coin among the counterfeits, but its many inconsistencies forbid any other course. The heavy inner
               borders, the clumsy, spindling letters of the inscriptions of both sides and the huge numerals of the reverse dictate this conclusion. The
               encroaching of the border on the letter L is evidence that the cog-wheel border was cut later than the inscription, something I believe contrary
               to the practice for the genuine pieces.</p>
            <p>E. The weight of this piece and the spelling ENGLAD as well as the metal (copper or bronze) mark this as the work of a bungler. One might say
               almost as much for F, but as at least three specimens are known and since it is die-struck, it is to be recognized as an attempt to make a
               fabrication which would mislead, and further specimens may appear.</p>
            <p>Since there is no center point for a compass visible, the maker seems not to have known that one was used for the genuine issues. The borders
               suffer in consequence, not only in not being true circles, but because the beads are not uniform in size.</p>
            <p>F is the work of another bungler; the misspellings give it away.</p>

               </head>
               <p>My first monograph on the Massachusetts coinage gave such data as I could discover for the work of Thomas Wyatt.<ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="27"/>
               <p>There is no occasion for repeating most of the information given there. The newspaper references to these productions are dated 1856. Does it
                  not seem probable that the two-hundredth anniversary of the coinage may have been taken as the reason for presuming an interest which might be
                  capitalized ?</p>
               <p>Of the eight pairs of dies associated with the name of <name type="pname">Wyatt</name>, the only ones bearing the Pine Tree type are the
                  sixpence, threepence and the penny. We do not know why he used an Oak Tree for the shilling rather than a Pine. It may have been merely for
                  the sake of variety. Nor do we know why he chose for the sixpence the less (?) common Pine Tree form. The specimens in copper which appeared
                  in Woodward's first two sales<ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref> are likely to have been the result of the unmasking of the series as counterfeits,
                  that is, by producing additional varieties in another metal.</p>
               <p>It will be remembered that the denouncing of Wyatt's counterfeits was based on two conditions of which he was ignorant. The twopence was
                  mistakenly dated 1652, the penny was never struck. In this he was apparently misled by the engraved plate in <name type="pname">Joseph
                     B.</name> Felt's <hi rend="italic">An Historical Account of the Massachusetts Currency</hi>, published in 1839, or by an earlier English
                  publication, Folkes' <hi rend="italic">Tables of English Silver and Gold Coins</hi> printed in 1763. The specimen illustrated by Crosby
                  differs from the others in the collection of the American Numismatic Society.</p>
               <p>There is slight occasion for commenting on the threepence and twopence, save to note that <name type="pname">Mr. W. L. Clark</name> has
                  discovered a combination of the obverse die of the threepence with the reverse die of the twopence.<ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref> It would not
                  be improbable that a combination of the obverse of the twopence <pb n="28"/> with the reverse of the threepence was in existence although none
                  seems to have been recorded.</p>
               <p>The qualities which betray the <name type="pname">Wyatt</name> fabrications are their uniform completeness and regularity. If the
                  illustrations on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VII and VIII are compared with their prototypes, those differences which in a description
                  seem minor are quickly caught by the eye of anyone familiar with the series. The flatness of these pieces is distinctive. In most cases, they
                  are "too good to be true."</p>

                  its cause (i. e., the section of the reverse at the same clock-position); the dies do not seem to have been in their proper relationship when

               <p>Establishing the order for Nos. 8–10, Crosby's dies 1-c and 1–d, requires having a large number of specimens for comparisons. A single obverse
                  die is combined with two differing reverses, Crosby c and d. Our Plate shows that No. 8 (Crosby 1<hi rend="sup">b</hi>) is the earlier — it
                  has been recut to form No. 10 (Crosby 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>). Crosby's order, therefore, must be reversed. This conclusion also changes his
                  ordering for the two reverses. One of these (Crosby's d) is combined solely with the earlier state of the obverse and must, therefore, precede
                  the second (Crosby c) which comes into use with the later recut obverse (Crosby 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>). The order thus established is No. 8

               cones. The units of the inner border form a crude oval and are not uniform in size; they are somewhat larger than those of the outer border. A
               guide line for the outer border shows clearly. Four S's instead of three mark this die and do not occur elsewhere in the coinage. The "periods"
               of the inscription are unusual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. NEW-ENGLAND*AN · DO* The date, 1650 (sic) is separated from the Roman numerals by a horizontal line. The beads of the
               borders are larger than those on the obverse, and the guide line for the outer border is clearly discernible. The letters of the inscription are
               unequal in height. The workmanship throughout is crude. Die struck.</p>
            <p>Crosby devotes four pages to this and the next-described counterfeits, quoting a letter from <name type="pname">Dr. Ammi Brown</name>, a
               collector of his day, which establishes that this fabrication was in existence by 1854. He comments on the slightness of any expectation of
               profit from the making of dies for such a piece, in view of the small interest in the entire coinage at that time. The variety used as a pattern
               for the tree seems to have been our No. 2 (Crosby 4F). None of the Pine Tree coins has its reverse inscription beginning at two o'clock as this
               one does, nor does any have such punctuation as occurs here. The divergence in weights is in itself sufficient to condemn these pieces. The only
               other die whose reverse inscription does begin as here, is the Oak Tree No. 3 (Crosby 9-G). Evidently, the intent was to produce a "rarity."</p>
            <p>Whoever cut this and the two following dies dated 1650 probably conceived them as patterns for the coinage authorized in 1652. The tree forms
               given them did not appear until late in the coinage for the Bay Colony — near its end for <name type="pname">B. Dr. Ammi Brown's</name> letter

               supplies what may have been the name of the vendor Getchell, withheld by Crosby at <name type="pname">Dr. Brown's</name> request, although there
               is no direct suggestion in the letter that Getchell was the engraver or die-cutter. Boscawen, given as the address of Getchell, is a small town
               sixteen miles from Concord. Three of the pieces obtained from Getchell at a low cost were sold by <name type="pname">Dr. Brown</name> to <name

               prominence to the provenience of these coins. When confronted with genuine Pine Tree pieces, they are to be condemned on the basis of

               At the sale of this collection (by W. E. Woodward, April 28, 1863, lot 1876), it was acquired by Charles I. Bushnell. In the sale of his

               is characterized as "weak" and "indecipherable," and "unique ?" is added. Its present whereabouts is unknown to me. Crosby describes it:
