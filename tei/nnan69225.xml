            </head>
            <p>I wish to express my appreciation of those who have aided me in this study. First, I wish to thank Professor <persName>Karl Lehmann</persName> of the <placeName>New York</placeName> University Institute of Fine Arts, without whose constant advice, valuable suggestions and kindly encouragement this paper could not have been written. The whole staff of the American Numismatic Society also gave great help and cooperation: especially Sawyer McA. Mosser who assisted me in the daily labors of my investigation and Sydney P. Noe who kindly gave access to the Museum's coins and permission to photograph specimens for illustration. I owe to the great courtesy and patience of <persName>Dr. Carlo Pietrangeli</persName> of <placeName>Rome</placeName> several photographs of casts now in <placeName>Rome</placeName> at the Museo di Roma, to my friend <persName>Dr. Catia Caprino</persName> information on objects in the Museo delle Terme in <placeName>Rome</placeName> and the knowledge of several articles and books unavailable in this country at the time this paper was written. I am also indebted for valuable information to <persName>Dr. Enrico Paribeni</persName> and Professor <persName>S. Cesano</persName>. Casts of coins have been kindly furnished by <persName>Mr. Frederick S. Knobloch</persName> and photographs by the Department of Coins and Medals of the British Museum and by <persName>Mr. Hans Holzer</persName>.</p>
            <p>My special thanks are due to my friend <persName>Dr. Bluma L. Trell</persName> with whom it has been very pleasant to discuss several problems, to <persName>Miss Elaine Pond</persName> and <persName>Miss Winifred Andrew</persName> for their kindness in undertaking the tedious task of revising my English style.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Many studies dealing with Roman imperial art take into consideration Roman imperial coin types. The importance of these types in interpreting the meaning of extant works of art is generally accepted, but neither the extent nor the limits of numismatic contribution to the study of art history of the imperial period has yet been clearly defined.</p>
            <p>That many official reliefs, statues and paintings of the empire influenced coin types is now a matter of common knowledge. It has been recognized by both archaeologists and numismatists.<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> How far this influence went and which types can be considered direct derivatives from sculpture or paintings is still uncertain although <persName>Regling</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n2">

               </ref>

               <ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> and others emphasized the changes which are to be expected in the passage of certain motifs from sculpture and paintings to coins: abbreviations, liberty in representing the attributes, etc.</p>
            <p>An investigation into the possible direct inspiration from sculpture or painting is appropriate for those motifs which we know – from extant monuments or from literary sources – to have appeared in the official art as well. To mention a few of these representations: images and busts of emperors, gods, prisoners, personifications of provinces. Also, many of the more elaborate compositions on the coins show similarities to the historical reliefs.<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> Many investigations of the origin of the coin types run into serious difficulty. There are many coin types which are very common. They occur on coins of
<pb n="2"/>
several emperors, without any important change. It would not be reasonable to assume that all these identical types derive from a complete series of sculptures or paintings. It does not seem very likely either that all die engravers successively took their inspiration directly from the same work of art.</p>
            <p>A solution to this problem was given by <persName>Lehmann</persName> who expressed the theory that new coin types reflect an only slightly earlier work of the official art.<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> Therefore, an origin from a sculpture or painting may be assumed whenever a representation is found on a coin for the first time. Later coins with the same representation would copy the earlier type. This view was rejected by <persName>Strack</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> and has yet to be definitely proved. It is evident that, as far as sculpture is concerned, the theory of the new types can be demonstrated only by a comparative study of several motifs as they appear both on coins and in sculpture during the whole imperial period.</p>
            <p>Such a comparative study has been made in this paper and attention has been given to two problems closely connected with the theory of the new types. The first one is whether the theory is acceptable for the whole imperial period. The second is whether the coin types which are not new repeat earlier ones without any connection with the trends of official sculpture. A large number of representations both on coins and in sculpture have the purpose of celebrating a victory or the victorious power of the emperor. Unusually interesting among the coins of this kind are those which show figures of defeated barbarians. This class of representations is especially suitable as a basis for a comparative study because it represents a series which ranges from the age of Augustus until the latest times of the empire. This paper presents some of the results of a complete study of these figures of barbarians both on coins and in official sculpture. Types of
<pb n="3"/>
the coins as well as those of the medallions have been considered. Provincial and local coinage of the period is out of the scope of our inquiry since it presents a set of problems quite different from those of the Roman coins.</p>
            <p>The ideas dictating the representations of the barbarians both on coins and in official sculpture are certainly the same. The victory always belongs to the emperor. On official reliefs the emperor always is the center of attention. Barbarians appear either to celebrate a specific victory of the emperor or, in a more general way, his victorious power. Battles between Romans and barbarians, the outcome of which might be uncertain, are unknown. The barbarian is always the vanquished, the humiliated, the prisoner, and the highest dignity he may reach is that of being invested by the emperor with the sovereignty of his country, only, however, as vassal king of the Romans. This Roman attitude towards the barbarian is evident from the earliest times of the empire and holds firm throughout the whole imperial period. The position of the barbarian grows more abased from the end of the second century. This is apparent from a comparison of the representations of the column of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> with those of the column of <persName>Trajan</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> The barbarian on the column of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> appears more completely defeated. The final annihilation of the enemy is a favorite theme of this monument. The majesty of the emperor is even more stressed than on the column of <persName>Trajan</persName>. Correspondingly, on the coins the barbarian becomes less important physiccally. He appears most often as an accessory to the figure of the emperor or Victory or some other Roman authority, whose majesty is increasingly stressed, and who often exercises acts of cruelty on the vanquished. It is interesting to recall the last arch we know to have been erected in <placeName>Rome</placeName> by the <hi rend="italic">Senatus Populusque Romanus</hi> in honor of an emperor. This arch celebrated <persName>Arcadius</persName>, <persName>Honorius</persName> and <persName>Theodosius</persName> "because they had wiped off from the face of the earth the nation of the Goths"<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> in 405, only four years before the assault on <placeName>Rome</placeName> by
<pb n="4"/>
that nation. Also on the coins of the latest period, the emperor, in contrast to historic reality, is celebrated as the vanquisher of the barbarians. Neither on coins nor in official sculpture did the advent of Christianity cause any change in the conception of the barbarian. He appears until the end as a sign of a victory or of the victorious power of the emperor over his military enemies.</p>
            <p>This identity of ideas is expressed through the same motifs both in sculpture and on coins. Faced with the necessity of expressing the maximum of ideas in a minimum of space, the die-engraver summarized multifigured scenes. Only the principal actors appear on coins. Landscapes, as well as every detail not essential to understanding the scene, are left out in the great majority of cases. Keeping this in mind, we find that the battle scenes of sculpture have their counterpart on the coins in representations such as those pictured in <ref target="#fig-22">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 5</ref>; <ref target="#fig-37">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 5</ref>. The scene is usually reduced to the triumphant emperor and a single enemy. The various forms of homage scenes, that is those representations where the barbarian is paying homage to the emperor, can be seen abbreviated on several types (<ref target="#fig-23">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 1</ref>). Barbarians in the triumphal procession (<ref target="#fig-30">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 3</ref>) and the migrations of the barbarians after the war<ref target="#CH1-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref> (<ref target="#fig-61">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVII, 3</ref>) are also found on coins. Isolated figures of barbarians decorated buildings or fora, or spandrels of the arches, and are found on the coins (<ref target="#fig-5">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 3</ref>; <ref target="#fig-15">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 1</ref>). The well known motif of the prisoner or prisoners at the foot of a trophy is very common on coins. This is also true for those representations showing the emperor and a defeated enemy (<ref target="#fig-19">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 2</ref>, <ref target="#fig-20">3</ref>).</p>
            <p>The greatest difference between coins and official sculpture is in the number of times a certain motif appears. Homage scenes are comparatively rare on coins. The only abbreviated multifigured scene to appear very frequently on coins from the Flavians until the middle of the fourth century is the battle scene. Favorite subjects of the coins are prisoners at the foot of a trophy, and the emperor or Victory with a prisoner at or under his feet. These motifs have no narrative intent. They are purely symbolic. The preference for purely symbolic
<pb n="5"/>
representations is natural, considering the limitations imposed by the flat and small reverse field, and it is an inherent character of the coin types of the imperial period.</p>
            <p>It seems that we can distinguish three periods based on the symbolic or narrative character of the scenes: the first, which lasted until the reign of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and <persName>L. Verus</persName>, shows occasional scenes of a narrative character; the second, from <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and <persName>Commodus</persName> until <persName>Constantine</persName> shows symbolic scenes on the coins and several multifigured scenes on the medallions; the third, after <persName>Constantine</persName>, shows almost exclusively symbolic figures on both coins and medallions. This division into three periods seems even more convincing if we notice that very often in the first period a certain war is celebrated by several new types and by several types formerly in use, and that details of arms and dress of the barbarians are rather carefully rendered. In the second period we find a far smaller number of new types on the coins and the barbarian is generally found as a small accessory to a figure of the emperor, Victory, or a virtue without any attention to details of dress and armor. The third period, with a few exceptions, shows a gradual impoverishment of the types.</p>

            <p>The new types with barbarians found on coins from the age of <persName>Augustus</persName> through the reign of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and <persName>L. Verus</persName> and their relationship to contemporary sculpture are the subject of this chapter. Not all new types of this period will be treated. Roman imperial sculpture does not offer us, as the coinage does, a complete series of dated monuments. A very large part of Roman sculpture is now lost. Among the new coin types, we have selected those which show a very close connection to extant works of the contemporary sculpture or else to works of sculpture for whose existence we have considerable evidence. These are the types which are treated at greater length. Mention is made also of several other types not only in the text, but especially in the footnotes, whenever this seems to give a better understanding of the topic under discussion. The conclusions we draw from the study of the above mentioned new types appear on p. 23.</p>

                  </ref> Furthermore, on the Spanish coins the two figures on the side of the central quadriga are certainly to be identified as barbarians because they are naked and have long hair and possibly beards. On the Roman coins they are very crudely drawn and on most specimens they look more like Roman soldiers than barbarians. The two types, therefore, probably reproduce two different buildings.<ref target="#CH1-n15">

               <p>It is the arch erected near the temple of <persName>Divus Julius</persName> in honor of the recovery of the standards lost by <persName>Crassus</persName> at <placeName>Carrhae</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n16">

               <p>The Parthian presenting a standard to Mars on the cuirass of the <persName>Augustus</persName> from Prima Porta was probably directly derived from the two standard bearers represented on the monument which appears on the Spanish coin.

We also have good reason to connect the coin with this monument because of its type.

The arch of Asper was certainly an imitation of an earlier one, also erected at <placeName>Antioch</placeName>, <ref target="#CH1-n22">

                  </ref> in the age of <persName>Augustus</persName>. Remains of the sculptural decoration of this monument, too, are extant. Slabs once in the spandrels show kneeling barbarians. It seems possible that the prototype for these arches of <placeName>Antioch</placeName> was the arch of <persName>Augustus</persName> near the temple of Divus Julius. This arch very probably was decorated with figures of kneeling barbarians in the spandrels and at least one of them was a Parthian standard bearer similar to the one on the arch of Asper. This figure was very likely the model of

the denarii referred to above. Possibly, another type of <persName>Augustus</persName> can be connected with the decorations of the spandrels in the same arch. The settlement of Armenia's affairs was also part of the political successes of 20 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.

                  </ref> Because of the location of the other monuments represented in the Haterii relief, it seems rather unlikely that the arch was located near the temple in the <placeName>Campus Martius</placeName>. The fact that the arch was erected near a sanctuary of Isis rather reflects the high consideration Isis enjoyed

from <persName>Vespasian</persName>. When this arch was erected, we do not know. It might have been erected before the triumph, possibly very soon after the capture of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> (7/8 September 70). That it was erected for <persName>Vespasian</persName> and <persName>Titus</persName>' victory over the Jews is demonstrated by the fact that in the Haterii relief we see on the attic of the arch, on each side of the central quadriga, a palm-tree with prisoners tied at its foot. The palm-tree stands as a symbol for <persName>Judaea</persName>. It is probable that it was erected before 79, the year of <persName>Vespasian's</persName> death, since two arches were erected after this date which also commemorated the victory over the Jews. One was erected at the entrance of the <placeName>Circus Maximus</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n29">

               <p>The Jewish war was widely celebrated on coins also. Types referring to it form two main groups. The first is composed of coins issued by <persName>Vespasian</persName> and <persName>Titus</persName> before <persName>Vespasian's</persName> death and especially in the years 71 to 73. The second consists of coins of <persName>Titus</persName> issued in 80/81. Therefore, broadly speaking, the first group corresponds to the Arcus ad Isis, the second to the arch in the <placeName>Circus Maximus</placeName>. The first group presents several representations new to coins, while the coins of <persName>Titus</persName>
                  <persName>Augustus</persName> repeat, as far as representations of barbarians are concerned, the most famous type of the issues of <persName>Vespasian's</persName> reign, a standing prisoner and a mourning woman at the foot of a palm tree<ref target="#CH1-n31">

                  <persName>Augustus</persName>, it is important to examine those issued during the reign of <persName>Vespasian</persName>.

               <p>Possibly, several of the coin types issued in honor of the victory over the Jews during <persName>Vespasian's</persName> reign, were influenced by this arch. It is noteworthy, for instance, that the type showing a standing prisoner and a mourning woman (<ref target="#fig-10">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 2</ref>) presents, for the first time in the history of Roman coins, two barbarians together in this attitude.<ref target="#CH1-n34">

                  </ref> It should also be mentioned in this connection that the sculptor of the Haterii relief worked in a crude way and his details are generally sketchy.</p>

               <p>It seems very probable that the most important new element found on the issues commemorating the Jewish war, the palm-tree, was borrowed from the sculptural decoration of the Arcus ad Isis.</p>

                  <p> Generally, on Republican coins, whenever two barbarians are represented at foot of a trophy – it has been pointed out above that on the <placeName>Judaea</placeName> Capta coins the palm-tree is a substitution for the trophy – they are both seated or else one is seated, the other kneeling. Standing prisoners appear at foot of a trophy, but in scenes of a different kind, as on denarii of <persName>S. Sulpicius Galba</persName> (BMCR, I, p. 488, nos. 3907f., pl. XLVIII, 21) and <persName>L. Aemilius Paulus</persName> (idem, p. 418, no. 3373, pl. XLIII, 8). The motif of the standing man and seated woman at foot of a trophy was on the contrary, already well known in sculpture. To the monuments showing this motif quoted by K. Woelcke (in <hi rend="italic">Bonner Jahrbücher,</hi> 120, 1911, p. 178) a few others should be added: the decoration on a shield on a relief at Parma (<persName>E. Loewy</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Jahrb. d. Kunsthist. <persName>Sammlungen</persName> in Wien</hi>, N. F. II, 1928, pl. III) and, later, the groups on the arch of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> at <placeName>Tripoli</placeName> (<persName>G. Caputo</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Africa Italiana</hi>, 1940, p. 46, figs. 24, 29; <persName>Kaehler</persName>, col. 443, no. 50; of the earlier bibliography on this arch, see specially <persName>S.

               <p>
                  <persName>Domitian</persName>'s triumph over the Chatti in 83 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d</hi>. was widely celebrated on the coins of the period. Several new types appear showing barbarians. Among these, the type showing a standing prisoner and a mourning woman at the foot of a trophy, is especially interesting (<ref target="#fig-12">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 1</ref>). It appears on sestertii struck in 85, 86 and 87.<ref target="#CH1-n35">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> Its similarity with the <placeName>Judaea</placeName> Capta type examined above is obvious. Nevertheless, at a closer examination, many differences between the two appear and several elements new to Roman coins are noticeable on the Germania Capta, type. The trophy represented is different from any other trophy represented before on a Roman coin because of the <placeName>German</placeName> "sagum" so prominently displayed. On republican and earlier imperial coins, a cuirass or a short tunic is generally found in its place. Moreover, the weapons scattered in the lower part of the field are different from those represented on the <placeName>Judaea</placeName> Capta type. Coins of 85 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d</hi>. also show an arch, a tetrapylon, surmounted by two quadrigae, drawn by elephants (<ref target="#fig-13">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 2</ref>). This type appears for the first time on sestertii of the same issue as the first of the above quoted coins showing a standing prisoner and a seated woman at the foot of a trophy and later, without any important change, in 90/91 and in 95/g6.<ref target="#CH1-n36">

                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> This theory is certainly not contradicted by the fact that the construction of the tetrapylon was connected with <persName>Domitian's</persName> victory over the Chatti.</p>
               <p>The most detailed representation of the monument is that on one of the Aurelian reliefs of the arch of <persName>Constantine</persName> (<ref target="#fig-14">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 3</ref>).<ref target="#CH1-n39">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> On the attic, at the left, a group of a standing prisoner and a mourning seated woman at the foot of a trophy is visible. The prisoner wears the costume of the Germans. The group does certainly differ in several details from the one on the coins (<ref target="#fig-12">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 1</ref>), especially as far as the arms are concerned. The prisoner's hands are tied in front, while on the coins they are tied in back. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the general composition of the scene, the costume of the man, the attitude and dress of the woman are the same. It is very likely that one coin type reproduces one group of the arch—another certainly existed on the other side of the elephants' quadriga, and the Aurelian sculptor did not have space enough for it – and the other coin type reproduces the arch itself.</p>
               <p>It has been noticed above that the trophy on the type in <ref target="#fig-12">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 1</ref> is different from any other trophy represented before on a Roman coin because of the <placeName>German</placeName> "sagum" so prominently displayed. This same kind of trophy appears on other coins of <persName>Domitian</persName> commemorating the same war. That this trophy was influenced by the sculpture of the period is shown by one of the two trophies of the period of <persName>Domitian</persName> which now decorate the balustrade of the Capitol in Rome, the so-called "trofei di Mario." This trophy also has the "sagum."<ref target="#CH1-n40">

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 1</ref>) were issued. In this case we have, therefore, the prototype of a new coin type among the extant works of sculpture.</p>
               <p>It is interesting now to investigate whether the colossal statues of the Dacians were new creations of <persName>Trajan's</persName> period. Similar statues were used later as decorations of public buildings of various kinds.<ref target="#CH1-n45">

                     <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                  </ref> mention should be made now of three new <persName>Trajan</persName>ic coin types. They have already been interpreted by several scholars. <persName>Mattingly</persName> and <persName>Strack</persName> regard them as direct reproductions of honorary statues of <persName>Trajan</persName>, now lost. One is found on a sestertius (<ref target="#fig-19">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 2</ref>) struck between 104 and 111.<ref target="#CH1-n52">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref> In this type, the statuary origin is suggested by the big base decorated with festoons. On this base, military eagles and standards are visible. In the center, there is a second base (?) on which <persName>Trajan</persName> stands clad in a toga. He holds the triumphal insignia, the laurel branch and sceptre. Two small barbarians appear, one on either side of the emperor. In some specimens, they seem to be kneeling and appear to be supported by shields. A flying Victory on the right above is crowning <persName>Trajan</persName>. She is probably an addition or a variant due to the die-engraver. The eagles, the standards and the barbarians are very likely part of the original composition.<ref target="#CH1-n53">

precedent for this type is the sestertius on which <persName>Domitian</persName> is represented with his foot on the <placeName>river Rhine</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n55">
                     <hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                  <persName>Trajan's</persName> type shows a new detail, only the head and shoulders of the barbarian are visible. This detail is also found on another type of <persName>Trajan</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n56">
                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                  </ref> but it disappears afterwards. It is certainly peculiar. From an artistic point of view, it is also rather awkward. The coins of <persName>Trajan</persName> show a generally high standard of artistic ability. Why did the die-engraver choose such an awkward detail ? Why didn't he represent the whole figure of the emperor's enemy? The whole figure would have been far more effective. The meaning of the scene would have been far more readily understandable. A careful examination of the coin types – those earlier as well as those later than the type of <ref target="#fig-20">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 3</ref> – does not give, at least to the writer, an explanation of the reason the die-engraver used the half figure of the barbarian. The fact that this detail disappeared so soon from the coins seems rather to suggest that the die engravers did not consider it the best device to represent the emperor's enemy on a coin.</p>
               <p>However, there is an explanation for this peculiar detail. A statue of <persName>Hadrian</persName> was found at <placeName>Hierapytna</placeName> (Crete). It is now at Constantinople.<ref target="#CH1-n57">
                     <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                  </ref> The emperor appears in military dress. He is standing with his left foot on a defeated barbarian (<ref target="#fig-18">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 1</ref>). Should an artist wish to reproduce this statuary group on a very small and flat surface he would have to resort to some devices. The emperor would have to be represented more or less in profile otherwise his attitude would not be very clear. An exact reproduction of the whole figure of the recumbent barbarian would hardly be possible. On a small and flat field this recumbent figure would be hardly recognizable. The artist would most probably limit himself to that part of the figure which is more clearly visible from every angle, the head and the shoulders.
<pb n="18"/>
It is interesting to notice that even on a mechanical photographic reproduction such as <ref target="#fig-18">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 1</ref> the head and the shoulders are the most clearly visible parts of the recumbent barbarian.</p>
               <p>Thus, the statue of Hierapytna gives the explanation, we have been seeking in vain, of <persName>Trajan's</persName> coin type. From the above said, the statue found at Hierapytna shows both the emperor and his defeated enemy in about the same attitude of <persName>Trajan</persName> and his Dacian. It seems to us that the only possible explanation for the half figure of the barbarian on <persName>Trajan's</persName> coin is the assumption that a statue of <persName>Trajan</persName> as model of the type existed. This statue must have been very similar to the one of <persName>Hadrian</persName> found at <placeName>Hierapytna</placeName>.</p>
               <p>It has been pointed out above<ref target="#CH1-n58">

                  <p> BMC. I, p. 162, no. 104, pl. 28, 1. This is the only investiture scene earlier than the types of <persName>Trajan</persName>. Its composition, with only two figures, both of which standing, is found again on coins of <persName>Antoninus Pius</persName> (BMC. IV, pp. 204f., nos. 1272ff., pl. 29, 2 and 8 and p. 367, no. §). The composition of <persName>Trajan's</persName> coin, with the emperor seated on a platform and additional figures, appears again on the coins of <persName>L. Verus</persName> showing the investiture of <persName>Sohaemus</persName> as king of <placeName>Armenia</placeName> (BMC. IV, p. 426, nos. 300ff., pl. 58, 11; idem, pp. 562f., nos. 1099ff., pl. 75, 8 and pl. 76, 1; idem, p. 566, nos. 1125f., pl. 76, 6 A). Medallions of Verus, struck in 166 (G., II, pl. 74,1 and 75, 10; cf. <persName>J. M. C. Toynbee</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Roman Medallions</hi>, p. 110, pl. 42,4) show an adlocutio rather than the investiture of a foreign prince. After <persName>L. Verus</persName>, investitures disappear from the Roman coins, although the appointment of <persName>Abgar X</persName> by <persName>Gordianus III</persName> is represented on the local coins of <placeName>Edessa</placeName> (<persName>A. R. Bellinger</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Eighth and Ninth Dura Hoards</hi>, NNM. 85, 1939, pl. 3, 52, 54). <persName>Strack</persName> (op. cit., III, p. 66) notices that in investitures of Parthian and Armenian princes on Roman coins, the barbarian has his back turned toward the emperor and his hand raised to the diadem. He suggests that this reproduces a real act of court ceremonial during the investiture of Oriental princes. This suggestion requires a confirmation from other sources, which cannot be found in extant works of sculpture. The gesture of raising the hand to a diadem or a tiara appears also on monuments which are earlier than the Roman imperial times and does not represent an investiture (See the base of <persName>Lysip's</persName> statue of <persName>Poulydamas</persName> in <placeName>G. D. K. Treu</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">Die Bildwerke von Olympia</hi>, III, p. 209, pl. LV, 1–3). Generally, in Roman sculpture, no definite line can be drawn between investitures and homage scenes. It seems very probable that one of the reliefs of the arch of <persName>Trajan</persName> at Benevento (<persName>A. Meomartini</persName>, <hi rend="italic">I monumenti di Benevento</hi>, p. 132, pl. XXIII) is to be interpreted as portraying the investiture of a Northern chief because of the similarity with the above quoted type of <persName>Antoninus Pius</persName>. The scene in one of the Aurelian reliefs of the arch of <persName>Constantine</persName> (<persName>L'Orange</persName>, op. cit., pl. 46a) has also been interpreted as an investiture by several scholars (see A. Domaszewski, <hi rend="italic">Religion des röm. Heeres</hi>, p. 6; <persName>M. Wegner</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Arch. Anz</hi>., 53, 1938, pp. 176ff.; <persName>J.

                  <p> G. Calza, in <hi rend="italic">Notizie degli Scavi</hi>, 1932, p. 201. The column certainly provided the model for several coin types which do not really pertain to this study. Among these, a sestertius of 114/115 might be mentioned (<ref target="#fig-28">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 1</ref>). See BMC. III, p. 216, no. *; <persName>Strack</persName>, I, p. 226, no. 453, pl. 8. The type was later imitated on a medallion of <persName>Hadrian</persName> (<persName>Strack</persName>, II, no. 443, pl. XVI; <persName>Toynbee</persName>, op. cit., pl. 26, 9) and also on coins of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> (Cf. <persName>J. Dobias</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Intern. Num. Congress</hi>, 1936, pp. 177ff.). This sestertius shows a pile of arms. Never before has a pile of arms of an almost square shape appeared as the single decoration of the field. This pile of arms occupies a large portion of the field. The type seems almost the numismatic translation of the base of the column of <persName>Trajan</persName> (on this base, see <persName>Hamberg</persName>, op. cit., pp. 123f.). The only difference lies in the conspicuous place occupied on the coin by the quiver and arrow. This is obviously a reference to <persName>Trajan's</persName> Eastern war.</p>
                  <p>Another instance of the close similarity between a coin representation and an official relief may be found on the arch of Benevento. It gives one more proof of the identity of ideas and subjects in official sculpture and coins. On the attic of the arch, on the side facing the country, <persName>Trajan</persName> appears receiving the submission of a female personification, kneeling between two rivers (<persName>Meomartini</persName>, op. cit., p. 160, pl. XXVI; <persName>Strong</persName>, II, pl. XL). The similarity between the relief and the coin type of <persName>Trajan</persName> (<ref target="#fig-29">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 2</ref>) with the legend <hi rend="smallcaps">armenia et <placeName>Mesopotamia</placeName> in potestatem p r redactae</hi> (BMC. III, pp. 221f., nos. 1033ff., pl. 42, 6–8) was noticed a long time ago and pointed the way to the right interpretation of the relief (<persName>A. Domaszewski</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Die Religion des röm. Heeres</hi>, pp. 56f.; idem, in <hi rend="italic">Jahreshefte öst. arch. Instituts</hi>, II, 1899, pp. 184f., fig. 93). It shows <persName>Trajan</persName> receiving the submission of <placeName>Mesopotamia</placeName>, or, possibly, that of <placeName>Armenia</placeName>, (see <persName>J. M. C</persName>. <persName>Toynbee</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Hadrianic School</hi>, pp. 15ff.; <persName>Hamberg</persName>, op. cit., pp. 69f.) standing between the <placeName>Tigris</placeName> and <persName>Euphrates</persName> rivers. The coin type, struck in 116/117, is new. Similar representations appear later on medallions of <persName>L. Verus</persName> (G., II, nos. 23, 24, pl. 74, 8; idem nos. 34, 35, pl. 75, 6) where <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and <persName>L. Verus</persName> appear between the <placeName>Tigris</placeName> and the <persName>Euphrates</persName> and on denarii of <persName>Caracalla</persName> (MS., IV, 1, p. 236, no. 175; idem, p. 227, no. 96). The two river gods, without the emperor, appear on bronze coins of Geta (MS., IV,1, p. 340, no. 171, pl. 16, 5. Cf. also the medallions of <persName>Alexander Severus</persName> and <persName>Gordianus III</persName>: G., II, p. 81, no. 17, pl. 99, 6; p. 88, no. 18, pl. 104, 1; p. 89, no. 24, pl. 104, 7–8). Despite their similarity, however, the relief of <placeName>Benevento</placeName> and <persName>Trajan's</persName> type do not seem to be derived from a common model. It is true that an arch was erected at <placeName>Rome</placeName> by the senate for <persName>Trajan's</persName> successes in the East in 116 A. D. (<persName>Kaehler</persName>, col. 388, no. 28, Cf. Dio, 68, 29). This arch could have had some influence on the arch of <placeName>Benevento</placeName>, at least in part, should the theory be accepted that 114 is the year in which the arch of <placeName>Benevento</placeName> was voted, rather than the year in which it was dedicated (see <persName>G.

the latter. It is especially important in studying medallions to investigate the early history which the type might have had in the regular coinage. From the period of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and <persName>L. Verus</persName>, medallions show, more often than coins, multifigured scenes with barbarians.</p>
               <p>A new type appears on medallions of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and <persName>L. Verus</persName> dated to 167<ref target="#CH1-n74">

It is easy to connect this type with a fragmentary relief in the Museo delle Terme.<ref target="#CH1-n75">

The relief is generally believed to be of the age of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and the hypothesis has been advanced that it belonged to a triumphal arch. In this case, it must have been an arch erected in honor of <persName>L. Verus</persName>' eastern victories, as the pointed cap on one of the prisoners indicates. An arch was erected for <persName>L. Verus</persName> in the first regio, but we know nothing more about it.<ref target="#CH1-n76">

               <p>Other medallions of <persName>L. Verus</persName> do not appear to be connected with a definite monument. Yet they do reflect in the general construction of a scene some tendencies of contemporary relief. The great frieze<ref target="#CH1-n77">

The Romans are represented in the upper zone. The tendency towards a battle relief divided in two parts appears increasingly often on a number of sarcophagi dating to the end of the second century. They were probably influenced by state reliefs celebrating the wars of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n78">

temporary official sculpture. There is reason to believe that several of them were actual reproductions of statues. This was suggested in the case of the standing Dacian on <persName>Trajan's</persName> coin (<ref target="#fig-15">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 1</ref>) which resembles the statues once standing in <persName>Trajan's</persName> Forum (<ref target="#fig-17">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 3</ref>). The type in which <persName>Trajan</persName> appears with his foot on a Dacian (<ref target="#fig-20">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 3</ref>) has been compared with the statue of <persName>Hadrian</persName> found at <placeName>Hierapytna</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-18">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 1</ref>). The presence of a base or the statuesque appearance of a figure helps bear out the theory of the sculptural origins of some coin types (<ref target="#fig-19">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 2</ref>, <ref target="#fig-21">4</ref>).</p>
               <p>Aside from these types which seem to be actual reproductions of statues, it seems that a direct influence from monumental sculpture can be found on others. Evidence has been provided by the reliefs of the arch of <placeName>Pisidian Antioch</placeName> for a type of <persName>Augustus</persName> (<ref target="#fig-5">

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 3</ref>, <ref target="#fig-32">5</ref>). Some new coin types seem to be abbreviations of larger narrative contexts, as has been pointed out in the investiture and homage scenes on <persName>Trajan's</persName> coins (<ref target="#fig-23">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 1</ref>ff.) or the types where the emperor appears riding and spearing his enemy (<ref target="#fig-22">

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 4</ref>).</p>
               <p>It is impossible, however, to omit mention of another possibility, namely, that both the sculptural representations and the coin types might be derived from a common prototype, the much discussed, but so little known, triumphal painting. The relationship between the painting and the sculpture has been the object of several studies. Among others, those of Rodenwaldt, <persName>Lehmann-Hartleben</persName> and <persName>Hamberg</persName> consider this problem. It seems, however, that this problem is outside of the scope of the present study.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> barbarians on coins dating from the end of the second century are increasingly small in size and appear as accessories to the larger figures of the emperor, Victory or other divinity.</p>
            <p>"Small barbarians" are found in several contexts. In most cases the only thing represented other than the barbarians is a Roman authority. This figure, emperor or divinity, is usually represented as standing or walking. One or two, but seldom more, barbarians may appear seated or kneeling at his feet (<ref target="#fig-19">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 2</ref>; <ref target="#fig-46">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 2</ref>, <ref target="#fig-48">4</ref>; <ref target="#fig-59">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVII, 1</ref>). In another motif the Roman authority has his foot on the defeated enemy (<ref target="#fig-20">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 3</ref>; <ref target="#fig-33">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 1</ref>; <ref target="#fig-47">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 3</ref>); this representation has its beginning with <persName>Domitian</persName>, appears on several coins of <persName>Trajan</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n83">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> and is especially frequent from the second half of the third century. The type representing a walking emperor or a divinity dragging a small enemy by the hair (<ref target="#fig-34">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 2</ref>) does not appear before the time of <persName>Constantine</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n84">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> Several types show a combination of these motifs. For instance, gold medallions of <persName>Constantine</persName>
               <pb n="26"/>
show the emperor dragging one enemy by his hair and at the same time trampling down a second one<ref target="#CH1-n85">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> (<ref target="#fig-35">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 3</ref>).</p>
            <p>In all these motifs the barbarians appear as accessories to the Roman emperor or divinity not only because of their small size, but also because there is no relationship of action between the Roman authority and his enemy. That is, the emperor or god seems rather unaware of the presence of the barbarian even when he is represented dragging his small enemy by the hair. That no real action is intended is shown, for instance, by the above mentioned medallions of <persName>Constantine</persName>, on which the emperor is in the very difficult position of walking, having a foot on one enemy and dragging the other, all at the same time. In another instance, the barbarian appears seated or kneeling under the hoof of the emperor's horse (<ref target="#fig-36">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 4</ref>), apparently oblivious of the action.</p>
            <p>It should be pointed out that there are two main classes of types showing the emperor riding. One shows him on a horse that is not galloping but pacing and the emperor is not fighting his enemy but seems totally unaware of him as on <ref target="#fig-36">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 4</ref>. On these coins the barbarian is usually of exceedingly small size. The "galloping-horse" series represents the barbarian in normal size<ref target="#CH1-n86">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> (<ref target="#fig-22">

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 5</ref>). The "pacing horse" motif appears on only a few coin types: those of <persName>Trajan</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n87">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref>
               <persName>Caracalla</persName>, <persName>Gallienus</persName>, <persName>Carausius</persName>, <persName>Allectus</persName>, <persName>Probus</persName> and <persName>Constantine</persName> I (<ref target="#fig-21">

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 4</ref>).</p>
            <p>Small barbarians also appear, without taking part in the action, in multifigured scenes. This occurs especially on medallions but also on a few coins dating from the period of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> to the end of the third century. For example, they are found in scenes in which one or sometimes two emperors appear with their following of soldiers,<ref target="#CH1-n88">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> in

a few triumphal processions,<ref target="#CH1-n89">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> occasionally in scenes of "adlocutio" and in multifigured scenes of "adventus."<ref target="#CH1-n90">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref> Finally, it should also be mentioned that on a few coin types of the third and fourth centuries small barbarians are represented in the exergue.<ref target="#CH1-n91">
                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> In this case, the emperor or emperors appear in the center of the field.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the small physical size of the barbarian is a device which emphasizes his abject position in contrast to the victorious emperor or divinity. This tendency was already apparent on some coin types of the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n92">

               </ref> but does not appear in its full development until the time of <persName>Trajan</persName>. Under the reigns of <persName>Hadrian</persName> and <persName>Antoninus Pius</persName> there are only a few types with barbarians large or small. Under <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and <persName>L. Verus</persName> both large and small barbarians are present. From the time of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and <persName>Commodus</persName> the small barbarian is much more frequent. There is hardly an emperor who does not have several coin types with small figures of barbarians either at or under the foot of the <persName>Augustus</persName>, the <persName>Caesar</persName> or Victory. The coins representing "small barbarian" figures increase in number during the third and fourth centuries and continue to the last of the Western emperors. Little by little the meaning of the type changes. At first the barbarian is a symbol of a people recently vanquished by the emperor. Later the connection with an actual victory is less often found. The legends which accompany the emperor or Victory are more frequently general in meaning: <hi rend="smallcaps">victoria avg, victorioso</hi>
               <pb n="28"/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">semper, victor omnium gentivm</hi>, etc. It is well known that the change in legend accompanied the change in the concept of the triumph. Triumphs were no longer celebrated in order to commemorate a certain event. They were celebrated periodically and all races of barbarians were made to participate in them.<ref target="#CH1-n93">
                  <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
               </ref> It is evident that the barbarian becomes the symbol of the emperor's victories in general, of his most celebrated virtue, the victorious power. Since the barbarian is the almost constant companion of nearly every emperor, it can be said that he really becomes the attribute of the emperor and his special goddess, Victory. The definition of the barbarian as an attribute is not a matter of interpretation. Without doubt the die-engraver consciously considered it so. For instance, in 183/184 two issues in silver were made by <persName>Commodus</persName>. In the first issue, we see the figures of Minerva (<ref target="#fig-38">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 6</ref>), Aequitas, Felicitas and Victory (<ref target="#fig-39">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 7</ref>) without any attribute. The second issue repeats several of the types of 183 but with something added which has the purpose, in <persName>Mattingly</persName>'s words, "to bring out thespecial character of its figure."<ref target="#CH1-n94">
                  <hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>The symbolical value of the "small barbarian" as it appears in statuary groups has been set forth by several authors.<ref target="#CH1-n96">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref>

            <pb n="29"/>
            <p>Many have also noticed the similarity between these representations and those on the coins. It is generally admitted that in statuary groups such as the one found at <placeName>Hierapytna</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n97">
                  <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
               </ref> (<ref target="#fig-20">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 3</ref>) there are, as on the coins, symbolical representations of the victory of the emperor over his barbarian enemies. In regard to sculpture there are several problems to be considered. Did representations of small barbarians appear frequently enough to warrant the use of the term "attribute''? It has been mentioned above that other divinities besides the emperor and Victory appear with the barbarian attribute. Did the same divinities appear with the same attribute on sculpture also?</p>
            <p>That the "small barbarian" was taken over from sculpture by the die-engraver is certain, for two reasons. First, this type appears in its full development on the coins of <persName>Trajan</persName> which are reproductions of honorary statues of the emperor.<ref target="#CH1-n98">
                  <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
               </ref> Secondly, the appearance of the "barbarian-attribute" on the coins was preceded by some figures of barbarians of rather small size. This tendency had been present in sculpture also before the age of <persName>Trajan</persName>. A "small barbarian" is portrayed with <persName>Domitian</persName> in a group found at Olympia.<ref target="#CH1-n99">
                  <hi rend="sup">18</hi>
               </ref> In <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, another fragmentary statuary group has been found. It shows an emperor and a kneeling captive woman at his feet. It is probably to be dated to the end of the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n100">
                  <hi rend="sup">19</hi>
               </ref> It is likely that these statues had been preceded by other similar monuments.<ref target="#CH1-n101">
                  <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
               </ref> It should be pointed out that the representations in which the enemy appears of small size have been generally called "oriental". Many similarities may be seen between the Roman representations and those in the art of the Orient, especially Egyptian, but an actual derivation of motifs from Oriental art can not be demonstrated. First of all, a difference in size between the more important figures and the minor ones is
<pb n="30"/>
traceable even to classic <placeName>Greek</placeName> art.<ref target="#CH1-n102">
                  <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
               </ref> Reliefs portraying the gods and their adorants represent the latter as of smaller size.</p>
            <p>In this connection, a passage of <persName>Plinius</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n103">
                  <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
               </ref> is worth mention. <persName>Plinius</persName> tells us that, after the victory over the Samnites, Spurius Carvilius made from their arms a large statue of Jupiter in the Capitol and "e reliquiis limae suam statuam fecit quae est ante pedes simulacri eius (sc. Jovis)". Obviously, Carvilius' image must have been much smaller than the one of Jupiter. The tendency to represent the vanquished smaller in size than the victor is present in mythological representations of the Hellenistic age, as in statuary groups of the labors of Herakles.<ref target="#CH1-n104">
                  <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
               </ref> The motif most frequently linked with Oriental or Egyptian art is the one which shows the emperor with his foot on a barbarian, as in the group of <placeName>Hierapytna</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n105">
                  <hi rend="sup">24</hi>
               </ref> Even on classical work, such as the Strangford shield, the warrior, commonly identified as Perikles, has his left foot on a fallen Amazon.<ref target="#CH1-n106">
                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
               </ref> Nor can it be forgotten that a warrior appears with his foot on a defeated enemy in a group decorating an Etruscan candelabrum.<ref target="#CH1-n107">
                  <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
               </ref> This group is in the Museo Archeologico in Florence and is probably to be dated to the second
<pb n="31"/>
half of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c</hi>. On coins of the later empire the motif of the emperor or Victory dragging a barbarian is frequent. This, again, can be traced back to the Amazonomachies of classical <placeName>Greek</placeName> art.<ref target="#CH1-n108">
                  <hi rend="sup">27</hi>
               </ref> Therefore, it is clear that sculpture did not directly borrow these victory motifs from the Oriental or Egyptian arts. They were a result of the Roman conception of the emperor and the barbarian and can be traced back to classical <placeName>Greek</placeName> art.</p>
            <p>The representation of the barbarian as a general symbol of victory rather than of a victory over a certain people probably took place earlier in the statuary than on the coins. On statues the reference to an actual victory is less pronounced than on coins since statues in many cases lack the commemorative purpose so many coins have, especially in the early empire. The barbarian as a symbol of victorious power is certainly already present in the statue from <placeName>Hierapytna</placeName>. To this statue, others are more or less related, for example, a fragment from Ramleh now in the British Museum, <ref target="#CH1-n109">

            <p>A famous monument of the tetrarchs shows that a continuity of the motifs representing the emperor with small barbarians existed in the official sculpture. On the arch of Saloniki, the four tetrarchs appear (<ref target="#fig-43">

               </ref> and that it should appear for the first time on reliefs on monuments as late as those of the tetrarchs.

            <p>It is significant that the pacing-horse motif with the barbarian attribute, appears on only a few coin types. This probably indicates that it was not a common statuary motif.</p>
            <p>Not only the emperor and Victory but also some other divinities appear on coins with small barbarians at their side or under their feet. For instance, we have Minerva on a type (<ref target="#fig-45">

               </ref> (<ref target="#fig-48">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi>. XIII, 4</ref>). The presence of the
<pb n="36"/>
barbarian as an attribute on types with divinities can be explained in only one way, as a transfer of the attribute from the emperor. Victory has the barbarian as an almost constant attribute because she was associated with every emperor. It seems natural that the virtues of the emperor, such as Pax, should occasionally have the barbarian as an attribute. The gods are shown with the barbarian either because, like Mars, they were closely associated with all the emperors, or because they were at first closely connected with one single emperor, as was Sol with Aurelian and Jupiter with Diocletian.</p>
            <p>It is well known that the Roman emperor took many of his emblems from the gods. However, sufficient attention has not been paid to the fact that the emperor himself influenced the iconography of the gods although this has been recognized in regard to the cuirass which Jupiter Dolichenus, Heron and other deities, Syrian and Egyptian, borrowed from the Roman emperor.<ref target="#CH1-n141">
                  <hi rend="sup">60</hi>
               </ref> The influence of the ruler on the iconography of the gods is an age long trend. A cuirass may have been borrowed even from the Hellenistic ruler by some of these divinities. More significant for the present purposes is the fact that even in republican times the gods borrowed something from the triumphator, although temporarily. <persName>Hercules</persName> was honored in the Forum Boarium as <persName>Hercules</persName> Triumphalis and his statue, decorated with the triumphal insignia, was carried in the triumphal procession.<ref target="#CH1-n142">

               </ref> The next step is a statue of a god with permanent triumphal insignia. Moreover it is impossible to forget the widespread influence that triumphal art exercised on traditional
<pb n="37"/>
mythological subjects. Some images of Nemesis treading down Hybris may have been influenced by the emperor with the barbarian.<ref target="#CH1-n144">
                  <hi rend="sup">63</hi>
               </ref> The triumphal procession on official monuments certainly influenced some scenes of the triumph of Dionysos.<ref target="#CH1-n145">

               </ref> Influenced by the monuments celebrating <persName>M. Aurelius</persName>' wars, some representations of the Amazonomachy on sarcophagi and in statuary groups show some unusual and noteworthy elements.<ref target="#CH1-n146">

            <pb n="38"/>
            <p>The assumption that the transfer of the barbarian attribute from the emperor to gods associated with him took place in sculpture, is, therefore, logical and several monuments confirm this theory. An important class of these monuments belongs to provincial art. A statuary group found at Jioux,<ref target="#CH1-n147">

            <p>Although the barbarian as an attribute of the gods is relatively frequent on coins it is only sporadic among extant works of art. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that any coin type showing such motifs was inspired by a monument of the official sculpture. How invalid such an assumption would be is shown by the coin types of Aurelian. It is generally admitted that several of the coins of this emperor give the image of the cultus statue in the new temple

               <p> Statuettes of barbarians in bronze and the remains of a foot of a relatively large figure (certainly of an emperor or of Victory) are very probably derived from full size statues. These statuettes are studied by <persName>P</persName>. <persName>Bienkowski</persName>

Possibly, the colossal bronze emperor at <placeName>Barletta</placeName> had a small barbarian under his foot (see J. Koch, in <hi rend="italic">Antihe Denkmaler</hi>, III, 1913, pl. XX, XXI; <persName>R. Delbrück</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Spätantike Kaiserporträts,</hi> pp. 219ff., pl. n6ff., believes that the devil-snake is rather to be imagined under the emperor's foot). See also a fragmentary group in S. Ferri, <hi rend="italic">Arte romana sul Danubio</hi>, fig. 107 and footnote on p. 104. A group at Langres (Espérandieu, op. cit., IV, no. 3248) shows a vanquished province kneeling and an emperor. However, their relative sizes are normal. An example from the minor arts is provided, for instance, by the silver shield of a signum in Neuwied from Nieder-biber (S. Reinach, <hi rend="italic">Répertoire des reliefs</hi>, II, p. 83, 2).

               <p> The figure of <persName>Hercules</persName>, the motifs of the eagle and – less frequently – the lion are found several times in the reliefs of the arch of Saloniki.

               <p> On two medallions, one of <persName>Constantine</persName> I, the other of <persName>Constantine</persName> II (G., II, p. 135, no. 19, pl. 131, 2; idem, II, p. 142, no. 20, pl. 134, 6), the barbarians are of no smaller size than any Roman would have been if represented in the same context. Also, they are an integral part of the scene. It is indeed significant that these medallions are conceived in a purely naturalistic style. Most medallions of the period illustrate the late tendency to stylization and calligraphism. (See <persName>J. M.

                  <hi rend="italic">(Studies in Roman Imperial Art,</hi> p. 188) notices how the relief of a sarcophagus (?) in the Casino of the Villa Doria Pamphili (Rodenwaldt, in <hi rend="italic">Abhandlung. preuβ. Akad. der Wissensch.,</hi> 1935, no. 3, p. 24, pl. 8; see also G. Habich, <hi rend="italic">Die Amazonen gruppe des attalischen Weihgeschenks,</hi> pp. 69f.) shows both traditional elements of the Amazonomachy and elements of the Roman triumphal relief. The part played by the Amazons is not very clear. This relief was dated by Rodenwaldt to the late Antonine period. On another Antonine monument, an Amazon appears as the enemy of a barbarian. This is the statuary group found at Anzio, now in the Terme Museum (<ref target="#fig-49">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 5</ref>). See <hi rend="italic">Boll. Studi Medit.,</hi> 3, 1932, pl. 4, 2; <hi rend="italic">Mostra d'arte antica,</hi> 1932, pl. 18; <persName>A. Schober</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Jahreshefte öst. arch. Inst.,</hi> 28, 1933, pp. 105f.; fig. 38; <persName>B. Schweitzer</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Jhb.,</hi> 51, 1936, pp. 158ff., fig. 3). <persName>A. Schober</persName> (loc. cit.) suggests that it represents an Amazon transformed into the Roman Virtus, riding over a barbarian. <persName>B. Schweitzer</persName> (loc. cit.) rightly notices, however, that the Amazon is wounded and, therefore, does not appear as a victor. A satisfactory explanation of the fact that the Amazon appears as the enemy of the barbarian has not yet been given. Evidently, a change in the traditional concept of the Amazonomachy occurred at some time in <placeName>Rome</placeName>. According to this, the Amazons did not necessarily represent the barbaric element. It is rather tempting to advance an hypothesis. Might not this change be related to the one emperor who considered himself to be the friend of the Amazons, nay, almost an Amazon? Dio (73, 15, 3 and 20, 2) relates that <persName>Commodus</persName> took the name of Amazonius and gave the name of Amazonius to the month of December. He also required that the senators, when he took part in the spectacles of the arena, should shout "always you win, oh Amazonius." This is mainly confirmed by the author of the Vita (XI, 9), who connects the name of Amazonius to <persName>Commodus</persName>' passion for his concubine Marcia "quam pictam in Amazone diligebat, propter quam et ipse Amazonico habitu in arenam Romanam procedere voluit." <persName>Commodus</persName>' Amazonian sympathies (see also Vita Albini, II, 4) are illustrated by extant monuments; the well known bust in the Conservatori (<persName>Strong</persName>, fig. 233), the medallions showing the jugate obverse portraits of <persName>Commodus</persName> and an Amazon (certainly Marcia), while a pelta is represented below (G., II, pls. 85, 9, 10; 86, 3; 87, 5). Another medallion of <persName>Commodus</persName> has an Amazon standing in front of her horse (G., II, p. 71, no. 177, pl. 89, 9 cf. <persName>J. M. C</persName>. <persName>Toynbee</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Roman Medallions</hi>, p. 144 and note 175). The connection of the changed conception of the Amazonomachy with <persName>Commodus</persName> is merely an hypothesis. There are certainly difficulties. For instance, a group in the Galleria Borghese shows an Amazon riding over two warriors (W. Helbig-<persName>W. Amelung</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Führer durch die öffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertümer in Rom</hi>, II, p. 253, no. 1565 with earlier bibliography; Schober, op. cit.; Schweitzer, op. cit.; Arndt-Amelung, <hi rend="italic">Einzelaufnahmen</hi>, nos. 2779ff.). One of them is certainly a barbarian. However, this group which is greatly restored and worked over cannot be dated. Another group of Amazonomachies shows influence from the triumphal art. On a group of Roman sarcophagi, one of the Amazons appears in the attitude of the "triumphator" (See R. Redlich, <hi rend="italic">Die Amazonensarkophage des 2. und 3. Jahrhunderts</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Schriften zur Kunst des Altertums</hi>, IV, 1942, p. 36ff.; C. Robert, <hi rend="italic">Die antiken Sarkophagreliefs</hi>, nos. 80, 79, 84). These sarcophagi are dated by Redlich to ca. 180.</p>

               <p> On these monuments, see especially S. Ferri, <hi rend="italic">Arte romana sul Reno</hi>, pp. 79ff., pp. 216ff. and passim. The hypothesis has been advanced that these groups might be explained as victory monuments erected in honor of the Roman emperors and their victories over the barbarians. The anguipeds would then be symbols of the barbarians (F. Haug, in <hi rend="italic">Mainzer Verbandstag</hi>, 1903, Bericht, pp. 52ff.; A. Riese, <hi rend="italic">Die Gigantensäulen,</hi> pp. 30ff. and others). The theory that these monuments commemorate particular victories has been generally refuted (see especially F. Hertlein, <hi rend="italic">Die Juppitergigantensäulen</hi>, pp. 64ff.). They were probably intended as homage to the major local deity and at the same time to the Roman emperor.

               <p> This is the reason for the appearance of the small barbarians in multifigured scenes (see above p. 26). The victorious power of the emperor had to be celebrated to some extent in monuments not directly connected with a victory. For instance, on the arch of the Argentarii (M. Pallottino, <hi rend="italic">L'arco degli argentari</hi>, 1946) Parthian prisoners appear on the West side. It seems natural that on a coin, which is a complete monument by itself, the victorious power of the emperor should be symbolized by the addition of his attribute. The small barbarians in the exergue of some coins (see p. 48) are to be explained in the same way. They bear a certain resemblance to some reliefs where the barbarian prisoners are relegated to a separate lower zone as in the base of the obelisk at Constantinople (Cf. p. 48, note 32) or in the cameo in Vienna (<persName>Strong</persName>, fig. 57) or in the "grand camée de France" (<persName>Strong</persName>, fig. 58).</p>

               <hi rend="bold">III THE SECOND AND THIRD PERIODS: THE TRADITIONAL TYPES</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The investigation of the barbarian attribute leads to some conclusions regarding another of the problems with which this study is concerned. This problem is the significance of the "traditional" types. In other words, when the die-engraver repeats motifs already well known because of their appearance on earlier coins, is this a purely numismatic process without any relationship to sculpture? That this is not the case, is partly implicit in the general characteristics common to both coins and sculpture.<ref target="#CH1-n162">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> It has been observed that several of the most common motifs of the coins – considering them in a general way, without attention to variants – were very common in sculpture. It was evident, for instance, in the motif showing a prisoner or prisoners at the foot of a trophy. The extant monumental remains of <placeName>Rome</placeName> showing this motif are scanty. Prisoners at the foot of a trophy appear on the zoccoli of the arch of <persName>Constantine</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n163">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> A monumental trophy with a barbarian from the time of <persName>Domitian</persName> is still extant.<ref target="#CH1-n164">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> There is no doubt that these motifs were extremely frequent in the monumental sculpture. Their use as decorations of the attic on several arches is testified by the representations of these monuments on coins and reliefs.<ref target="#CH1-n165">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> Outside the city of <placeName>Rome</placeName> prisoners at the foot of a trophy
<pb n="42"/>
are still visible on triumphal arches and in reliefs which once decorated them,<ref target="#CH1-n166">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> and some fragmentary monumental trophies are still extant.<ref target="#CH1-n167">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> It is unnecessary to recall how widespread these motifs are in works of art of all periods such as sarcophagi, cuirasses of imperial statues, reliefs and items from the minor arts. They were used as decorations of the capitals of columns also.<ref target="#CH1-n168">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> It may be concluded that the continuity of these motifs on coins indicates a similar continuity in the monumental official sculpture. Furthermore, the study of the barbarian attribute leads to the conclusion that such a continuity may be assumed in cases where extant remains, ancient reproductions of the monuments, products of sculpture, or of the minor arts in general are not as plentiful. Another conclusion, too, may be reached, namely, that a coin with an already known motif indicates that the motif was still in the living "répertoire" of the monumental art at the time the coin was issued.</p>
            <p>This study of the traditional types is especially interesting in the
<pb n="43"/>
second and third periods in the history of the coin types showing barbarians. It has been noticed<ref target="#CH1-n169">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> that from the age of <persName>M. Aurelius</persName> and particularly from the second part of his reign, the period of his joint rule with <persName>Commodus</persName>, traditional and symbolic types are the almost exclusive rule on the coins, and that only on the medallions is a certain variety of representations to be noticed. In the light of the observations made on the traditional types, it seems impossible to deny value to the coin types as aids in understanding the history of sculpture even at this time when they are more or less standardized. It seems indeed that the coins may give a lead in the study of the symbolic motifs. Some indications as to the general trend of the more complicated narrative scenes may be given by the medallion types.</p>
            <p>The next problem is whether in the second and third periods the new coin types indicate the existence of a more or less contemporary monument. This seems very probable indeed for the age of <persName>Severus</persName> but after <persName>Severus</persName> it has not been possible to show a definite connection.</p>
            <p>Some especially important new coin types of the second and third periods should be discussed although the connection of most of them with possible monuments is <hi rend="italic">purely hypotethical</hi>.</p>
            <p>Several new types appear on coins of Severus, <persName>Caracalla</persName> and Geta. It is in this period that the definite appearance of a motif frequent on coins of the third century takes place. This is the one depicting two Victories holding a shield and two seated prisoners below under the shield. (<ref target="#fig-53">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 1</ref>). It appears on a denarius of <persName>Caracalla</persName> struck in 201/206.<ref target="#CH1-n170">

               </ref> On earlier types only one prisoner is represented.<ref target="#CH1-n171">
                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> It is probable that a monument of the age of <persName>S. Severus</persName> provided the
<pb n="44"/>
model. There is still extant the base of a column of Diocletian, erected in the Forum, which shows a similar motif.<ref target="#CH1-n172">
                  <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
               </ref> Another motif appears for the first time on coins of S. Severus and <persName>Caracalla</persName>, that of Victory leading by the hand a small figure of a barbarian, apparently a child<ref target="#CH1-n173">

               </ref> (<ref target="#fig-54">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 2</ref>). No attempt had been made before of translating one of the elements of the sculptural narration of a war into the language of the coins, such as the sparing by the Romans of young barbarians while their elders are led into captivity or killed. Motifs of this kind appear also in the monumental sculpture of this period.<ref target="#CH1-n174">

               </ref> Sestertii of <persName>Caracalla</persName> and Geta show a new kind of personification of <placeName>Britannia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n175">

Accordingly, the barbarian on the left has the traditional Oriental pointed cap. The barbarian on the right has the traditional Northern characters.

The details of dress and physical appearance are not very dear on coins of the later empire. Such a sharp difference between two barbarians, is, therefore, seldom found on the same coin.

               </ref> Several of these coins show barbarians on the reverse. Despite several variants, there are four main types: A) a warrior standing and spearing (<ref target="#fig-60">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVII, 2</ref>) a horseman; B) a warrior leading a barbarian out of a hut; C) the emperor standing with two captives; D) the emperor on horseback spearing two enemies. Type A was struck by all the above mentioned princes. B, C and D by Constans and Constantius II. Two of these types, A and B, are new. On C two barbarians appear on one side of the standing emperor. This is a variation from the usual schemes showing the emperor with a barbarian on either side. Type A is perhaps the most interesting, because although the motif can be traced back to <placeName>Greek</placeName> representations of the Amazonomachy, it is rare in Roman sculpture. As for type B, the motif of a Roman leading a barbarian by the hand, is not new,<ref target="#CH1-n186">
                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
               </ref> but the addition of the hut and the tree is. The figure is certainly a barbarian because on several specimens the traditional barbaric features such as beard and trousers are clearly visible. Therefore, the scene could be interpreted as the symbolic representation of one of the consequences of victory, frequently mentioned by later writers. Barbarians were often forced to
<pb n="48"/>
settle within the boundaries of the empire in order to cultivate the soil. The "Panegyricus" of Constantius is very illuminating in this respect.<ref target="#CH1-n187">
                  <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
               </ref> That the coin type under consideration is related to those forced migrations, is shown by the hut and the tree. They are an abbreviation of a whole landscape and indicate the woods and the huts where the barbarians lived.<ref target="#CH1-n188">

reason for this difference is difficult to understand. It is certainly to be studied in connection with analogous cases found on coin types not pertaining to this paper.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSIONS</head>
               <p>As a result of this study it has been possible to reach several conclusions both as to the coins and as to their usefulness in the study of Roman sculpture. Many coin types belonging to the first two centuries of the empire which were entirely new or which showed important new elements indicate that a more or less contemporary monument of the official sculpture of the city of <placeName>Rome</placeName> served as an original.<ref target="#CH1-n194">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> This is a point in support of the "theory of the new types." To distinguish whether a coin type is new or to distinguish a new element in a traditional type involves a long analysis. This analysis, however, has proved to be profitable. For the period after Septimius Severus no definite evidence could be found. It has been possible to show that traditional types on coins are an indication that the motif in question was still in the living "répertoire" of the monumental sculpture at the time the coins were issued.</p>
               <p>In the course of our analysis of coin types it has been possible to identify a new symbol of the imperial power, the barbarian attribute. Although the symbolical meaning of the small barbarian found as an accessory to the figures of emperor or Victory had been rightly emphasized by several authorities, his role of constant attribute of the emperor in the later empire had not been pointed out before, nor had attention enough been paid to the fact that this attribute was also
<pb n="50"/>
transferred from the emperor to the gods who were more closely associated with him. The study of motifs and subjects is only one element in the study of Roman imperial sculpture. Despite many illuminating studies, a general history of Roman imperial sculpture has not been written and factual evidence must have a great place in such a study.</p>
               <p>An aspect of the coin types which has not yet been taken into consideration in connection with sculpture is the one of style. In regard to this it will certainly be important to study the difference in style between the various mints. This involves a general study and knowledge of coins rather than an analysis of types such as has been presented in this study. The analysis of coin types combined with a knowledge of their style and an understanding of the current of ideas they reveal will aid a great deal in solving problems concerning the sculpture and may also shed some light on the uncertain dates of the extant works of Roman sculpture.</p>

               <p> This is also apparent in the great Ludovisi battle sarcophagus (<persName>Strong</persName>, fig. 200; Paribeni, op. cit. (on p. 22, note 3) p. 119, no. 178; <persName>G.

G</persName>. <persName>Hamberg</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Studies in Roman Imperial Art</hi>, pp. 181ff., etc.) illustrated <ref target="#fig-58">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 6</ref>. It has been rightly recognized that the battle represented there does not refer to a specific historic event (see especially <persName>Hamberg</persName>, loc. cit.) It celebrates the general as "victor omnium gentium" or (cf. the type of Numerianus, <ref target="#fig-59">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVII, 1</ref>) as "undique victor." Barbarians of both Oriental and Northern type are represented on the sarcophagus. The date of the sarcophagus is uncertain. The most widely accepted date is the second quarter of the third century A. D. Later periods as those of <persName>Gallienus</persName> (<persName>A. Della Seta</persName>, <hi rend="italic">I monumenti dell'antichità classica</hi>, p. 230, fig. 535; <persName>L. Kjellberg</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Grekisk och Romersk Konst</hi>, p. 326) and of <persName>Claudius</persName> II (<persName>R. Paribeni</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Optimus Princeps</hi>, II, p. 82f.) have also been proposed. It seems that the coins point to a rather late date for the Ludovisi sarcophagus and not only because of similarities in the general idea. On the Ludovisi sarcophagus, on the left, there is a group of a Roman soldier and a barbarian. The Roman grasps the prisoner by the bearded chin. This recalls a similar detail found on a type of Maximinus Daza and Severus II struck at Siscia in 305/308. Here the ruler is represented dragging a prisoner. Another barbarian is seated on the ground. Instead of dragging the barbarian by the hair as usual in representations of this kind, the emperor is holding his enemy's beard (<ref target="#fig-57">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 5</ref>); cf. <persName>Maurice</persName>, II, p. 297, XI, 1, pl. IX, 8). Furthermore, on the sarcophagus there is a lack of feeling for the organic structure of the figure. This is evident in the figure of the soldier which has been mentioned. The warrior's limbs appear strangely dislocated. The same lack of "corporeity" is apparent on many coins of the end of the third century. It is especially noticeable on coins of the fourth century and also on the type of Maximinus Daza and Severus II mentioned above (<ref target="#fig-57">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 5</ref>). Also, the general on the sarcophagus has his right arm and hand extended in a gesture of triumph (and prayer (?) see <persName>A. Alföldi</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Pisciculi</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">F. J. Dölger dargeboten</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Antike und Christentum</hi>, Ergänzungsband I, p. 13; H. P. <persName>L'Orange</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Arch. Anz</hi>., 1936, p. 604). The same gesture is found in reliefs of the second century A. D. (See <persName>G. Rodenwaldt</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Jhb</hi>., 55,1940, p. 16 and note 4 and also a marble panel in the Museo Capitolino, H. <persName>Stuart Jones</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Sculptures of the Museo Capitolino</hi>, p. 49, no. 3, pl. 9) and on sarcophagi with hunting or battle scenes of the third century. However, this gesture of triumph is more frequent on monuments of the end of the third century and later periods (cf. also the equestrian statue of a boy in the Museo delle Terme, Photo Anderson, no. 40839, possibly of the late third century). Several emperors are represented on the coins with their arm and hand in the same attitude as the general in the sarcophagus. Among those, also <persName>Constantine</persName> I and Licinius (<persName>Maurice</persName>, I, p. 215, XIII, 1, 2, pl. XVIII, 4). Perhaps, the Ludovisi sarcophagus might be dated at the end of the third century or the beginning of the fourth.</p>

               <p>For the meaning of the barbarians in the exergue, see p. 40, note 77. <hi rend="smallcaps">The vota pvblica</hi> type make it plausible to assume that the barbarian attribute was a simplified way of expressing the emperor's victorious power which in monuments of other kind was celebrated in independent scenes or in the lower zone of some reliefs. It should be remembered that the date proposed by Delbrück for the base of the obelisk at Constantinople is 369 (R. Delbrück, <hi rend="italic">Kaiserporträts</hi>, p. 185, pls. 85–88, figs. 64–66) and 368/369 is the date given by Pearce (loc. cit.) for the <hi rend="smallcaps">vota pvblica</hi> type. On the base, kneeling barbarians appear in a lower zone than the rulers who are seated facing. A real relationship between the <hi rend="smallcaps">vota pvblica</hi> type and the base cannot be established, because the date of 369 for the base is far from certain (See Bruns, in <hi rend="italic">Istanbuler Forschungen</hi>, 1935, pp. 69ff.).</p>
