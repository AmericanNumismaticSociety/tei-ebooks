            <p>The <placeName>United States</placeName> Silver Dollar provided the subject for the ninth annual Coinage of the Americas Conference sponsored
               by the American Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing Council as
               a forum for the dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of <placeName>North and South America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present
               papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all interested in the
               topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants to come to know the Society's collections and library
               better during the days of the conference.</p>
            <p>A special exhibit on the history of the silver dollar was put together by Modern Curator <persName>John M. Kleeberg</persName> and Registrar
                  <persName>Katharina Eldada</persName>. The exhibit showed the silver dollar from the standing archduke thaler of Archduke Sigismund of
               the <placeName>Tirol</placeName> to the present day, including silver crowns struck by the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint for
               other countries. The <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint also participated, exhibiting their modern commemorative issues of silver
               dollars.</p>

            </head>
            <p>In the first decades of the sixteenth century, the Counts of Šlik, lords of the fabulously rich mine in <placeName>St. Joachim's</placeName>
               valley in the Ore Mountains on the <placeName>Saxo-Bohemian</placeName> border, began to mint a new large size silver coin. It was soon
               referred to as "the coin from <persName>St. Joachim's</persName> valley," or the Joachimsthaler - abbreviated to thaler, which later would
               be anglicized to dollar. When the <placeName>United States</placeName> won its independence in 1783, the very successful <persName>Mexican</persName> version of the dollar, the <hi rend="italic">real de a ocho,</hi> was the most common coin in circulation in the colonies. It
               was natural to choose it as the basis of the monetary system of the colonies.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, if the Counts of Šlik and the mintmasters of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName> met with success, the
               same cannot be said of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. The attempts by the <placeName>United States</placeName> to produce a
               dollar coin in silver (and later, in copper-nickel) have repeatedly met with failure. With a role in several financial panics (1857 and 1893/5),
               and at least seven illicit special productions (1804 dollars, 1866 no motto dollars, 1884 and 1885 trade dollars, 1921 proofs, 1964 dollars), the
               checkered history of the silver dollar clearly has much interest for specialists in the <placeName>United States</placeName> series. It was
               for this reason that the COAC committee chose U.S. silver dollars as the theme for the 1993 Coinage of the Americas Conference.</p>
            <p>The first attempts to mint dollars met with delays because the minters could not post the surety bond required. After the amount of the bond was
               reduced in 1794, the minting of precious metal coins began. The new coins were not a success. Most silver bullion in the early <placeName>United States</placeName> was in the form of Mexican eight reales, which remained a legal tender until 1857. There was no incentive for merchants
               to bring Mexican dollars to the mint to be recoined into <placeName>United States</placeName> dollars; not only would they have to pay the
               cost of the minting, but they would also lose interest on their money while they waited for it to be coined into dollars. One of the few reasons
               for recoining silver at the mint was brought out by Robert <pb n="x"/>
               <persName>D. Leonard, Jr</persName>., when he delivered the Stack Memorial Lecture in April 1994 at the American Numismatic Society: to
               recoin cut silver coins into a more acceptable form.</p>
            <p>When silver was recoined into dollars, it was rapidly exported. Three early U.S. dollars are known with private Scottish mercantile countermarks.
               (They are discussed in more detail in <persName>Robert Stark's</persName> and my contributions below.) But most U.S. dollars did not stop
               their journey in Britain. The dollars would be bought up by the <persName>East India Company</persName>, which would then send them onward
               to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>, where they were used to buy tea. Only the development of the opium trade
               gradually brought some relief from the relentless silver drain to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>. Many early date
               dollars probably ended up by being melted and cast as sycee ingots.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>President Thomas Jefferson</persName> sought to cut off this silver drain. Just as he sought to isolate the country from the
               problems of Europe with his quixotic embargo, so he sought to cut down on the export of silver by ending the mintage of the classic trade coins:
               the dollar and the eagle. Henceforth, the half dollar would be the workhorse coin for bank transactions. The first attempt at an U.S. silver
               dollar had ended in failure.</p>
            <p>Although the mint made no silver dollars dated 1804, it continued to coin in that year using 1803 dated dies. In 1838, one of the most famous
               non-coin coins was created by Mint employees: the 1804 dollar. This artificial rarity proved extremely useful for swapping for rare pieces
               lacking from the Mint's collection and for supplementing the income of Mint officials.</p>
            <p>In the 1830s, a new attempt was made at coining silver dollars. Christian Gobrecht produced one of the most attractive silver dollar designs—the
               flying eagle dollars. Small amounts were minted in 1836-39. From 1840, the Mint began to strike more dollars, but they never circulated
               extensively, because the rise in gold production made silver more valuable compared to gold. The silver dollars disappeared into hoards. In 1857,
               the legal tender status of <persName>Mexican</persName> dollars was revoked. Unfortunately, this was during a silver shortage. <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>, under the brilliant finance minister Freiherr von Bruck, was hoarding silver so it
               could redeem its paper currency. In <persName>India</persName>, the outbreak of the Mutiny led to more demands on the silver market. The
               Taiping rebellion in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> was a further drain. By revoking the legal tender status of
                  <persName>Mexican</persName> dollars, yet another strain was put on the silver market when it could ill afford it. The market would have
               to rely on gold for specie. On August 24, 1857, the <persName>Ohio</persName> Life and Trust Company collapsed. On September 12, 1857, the
               SS <hi rend="italic">Central America</hi> was wrecked off <persName>Cape Hatteras</persName>. The panic was <pb n="xi"/> there, and nothing
               could stop it. It gripped the commercial centers of North America, passed on to Northern Europe, especially <persName corresp="#geonames_2911298">Hamburg</persName> and <persName>Scandinavia</persName>, and even affected merchants in <persName>Rio de
                  Janeiro, Montevideo</persName> and <persName>Buenos Aires, Valparaiso</persName> and <persName>Guayaquil</persName>, and far-off <persName>Batavia</persName>. Most of the major mercantile houses of <persName corresp="#geonames_2911298">Hamburg</persName> (which
               relied on the silver standard) collapsed. Only gold standard Bremen remained immune.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>During the Civil War, silver was hoarded, along with all other hard currency. In 1873, the coinage of silver dollars was quietly ended, and
               replaced by the trade dollar; but the collapse of silver prices led trade dollars to flood into the <placeName>United States</placeName>. In
               1878, the Mint ceased to make them for circulation. Instead, the <placeName>United States</placeName> embarked upon the monumental folly of
               the <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar and the <persName>Sherman</persName> silver act, which compelled the treasury to buy 187.5 tons
               of silver a month. As this silver poured into the treasury, the public, nervous about the country's commitment to the gold standard, drained the
               Treasury of gold. The result was the panic of 1893. The crises of the mid-1890s made it clear that this expensive subsidy to the mining interest
               could not continue. The issue was put clearly before the public in the election of 1896, and the public rejected the <persName>utopian</persName> plans of <persName>Bryan</persName> and went with <persName>McKinley</persName> and the gold standard. By 1904, the
               Treasury had used up its stock of silver, and the minting of <persName>Morgan</persName> dollars came to an end.</p>
            <p>In 1921, coinage resumed to replace the dollars melted under the Pittman act. Clandestine proofs were also made. In 1921, a new design, the Peace
               dollar, replaced the <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar. Mintage of the Peace dollar ended in 1928, but was resumed in 1934 and 1935 to
               subsidize Western mineowners. In 1964, the Mint again coined silver dollars, but was so embarrassed by the publicity that it recalled and claims
               to have melted all of them.</p>
            <p>The most recent attempt to introduce a dollar coin in the <placeName>United States</placeName>—the <persName corresp="#viaf_27864812">Susan B. Anthony</persName> dollar—again met with failure. The government tried to force the <persName corresp="#viaf_27864812">Susan B.
                  Anthony</persName> coins into circulation by paying armed forces personnel in Germany only in $2 bills and <persName corresp="#viaf_27864812">Susan B. Anthony</persName> dollars. In December 1980, however, the Deutsche Bank declared that it would henceforth
               exchange Susan <persName>B. Anthony</persName> dollars at the rate of only one <persName>Deutsche</persName> Mark per dollar, at time
               when paper dollars were trading at 1.75 <persName>Deutsche</persName> Marks per dollar. This meant that armed forces personnel had undergone
               a major pay-cut. The <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint went toe-to-toe with the Deutsche Bank; the outcome was never seriously in doubt. In
               January 1981, the Treasury had to abandon this experiment, and since then the <persName corresp="#viaf_27864812">Susan B. Anthony</persName>
               coins have gathered dust in Treasury vaults, <pb n="xii"/> carried on the books at their dollar value rather than their insignificant melt value.
               The Treasury refuses to take the loss, hoping it will be able to get rid of them somehow.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Some of this history is covered in more detail in the following pages, including much that is new. <persName>Eric P. Newman</persName>
               resolves one of the most controversial topics, the origin of the dollar sign. His article is particularly welcome, because many false
               explanations have become part of popular culture. <persName>Jules Reiver</persName>, who has inspired much research in the history of the
               early mint, gives a personal overview of the bust dollars. <persName>Kenneth Bressett</persName> details one of the most exciting new
               discoveries in the bust dollar series: the silver plug in the dollars of 1795. Professor <persName>Robert Stark</persName> discusses the
               various countermarks on early <persName>U.S</persName>. silver dollars.</p>
            <p>At one coin club I attended, a member brought in a <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar with a counterstamp which turned out to be a modern
               fantasy, although a rather interesting piece nonetheless. One of the fellow members said, "Now you have to VAM it." "Vam it?" "Determine the die
               variety from the work of <persName>Van Allen</persName> and <persName>Mallis</persName>." The "M" in this remarkable verb,
               Lieutenant-Colonel A. George Mallis, surveys the development of the designs of the 1878 <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar. Finally, I
               outline the problem of why the silver dollar was never able to make its way in international trade.</p>
            <p>Two appendices close the volume. <persName>Eric P. Newman</persName> gives a useful review of what we know about the 1804 dollar. I provide
               an account of two 1883-CC <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar dies which are in the collection of the American Numismatic Society.</p>

            <p>The written English language is and has been read from left to right just as have other European languages. <persName>Hebrew</persName>,
                  <persName>Arabic</persName> and some other Asian languages are and have customarily been read from right to left. An exception in the
               English language is the $ sign as accompanied by one or more numerals to its right. For example, in reading $6 the number is read first and the
               monetary symbol thereafter, so that such an amount is read from right to left instead of from left to right. This order of reading is and has for
               many centuries been used with respect to the symbol £ for the English monetary pound. Other countries have also followed such a practice of
               reading their own monetary symbols after the numerals even though numerals are placed to the right of their symbols. This practice is complicated
               theoretically in left to right reading when more than one numeral is used in a number because such a number is first read from left to right
               before the monetary symbol on the left of the numerals is added. The human mind easily adjusts to these conditions without the eyes changing
                  direction.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref>

            <p>The practice of writing in a manner to cause this exception developed as a matter of convenience and practicality in written money records and in
               calculations as will be more obvious from examples included in this study.</p>
            <p>The uncertainty as to the origin of the conventional $ sign was pointed out in the fourth edition (1859) of <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Webster's</persName> Unabridged Dictionary.</hi> Curiosity continued to develop and in 1865 an instructional monetary treatise

               <p>The Spanish and Spanish American silver coins known as pieces of 8 reals (reales) were customarily referred to in commercial transactions in
                  eighteenth century America, when the English language was used, as the dollar, the Spanish dollar, the Spanish milled dollar, the Spanish
                  American dollar, the Peru dollar, the <persName>Mexican</persName> dollar, the silver dollar, the cross dollar, the pillar dollar, the
                  bust dollar, etc. For Spanish speaking people such coins were called the peso or peso duro. For French speaking people those coins were
                  referred to as the piastre, a term of Italian origin. Technically there were some design, weight and fineness variations in the coins from
                  time to time but the varied expressions describing them were internationally understood by the commercial world and by the American
                  public.</p>
               <p>Money calculations are usually performed in one's native language, <pb n="4"/> whether written, spoken, or only mental. An abbreviation or
                  symbol for such a monetary unit simplifies the writing of the unit for everyone regardless of language, just as is true as to the written use
                  of numbers or numerals. To have a common symbol for a monetary unit which everyone might use in writing was a great advantage in bookkeeping,
                  communication and commercial transactions regardless of the language a person used to refer to that monetary unit. Thus it would be a
                  convenience for British colonists in America doing business in Spanish, French or English speaking regions to have a practical symbol for the
                  primary coin used in payments and trading transactions. The Spanish were using ps, pS, Ps and PS as abbreviations for pesos, customarily
                  written with flourishes and rubrica and often involving more than one horizontal level of writing. These abbreviations consisted of two
                  letters of the alphabet and were written in script or capitals in both upper and lower case. To use any form of ps as a symbol for the English
                  word dollar was somewhat confusing and cumbersome. Calculations needed a monetary symbol like the British £ (libra) which was entirely
                  distinctive and did not have to be repeated when extensively used. A symbol had to avoid interference with addition, subtraction,
                  multiplication and division as well as not blocking columnization or extension. It had to be different from all numerals and lettering and be
                  able to be placed close to them. The abbreviation in English of d or D for dollar had been used occasionally but was not distinctive because
                  it could be confused with d, the common abbreviation for English pence (denarius) or American money of account pence. Combinations like dl,
                  ds, dls, dol, dols, dolls and dollrs were used but consisted of lettering and were not brief enough. Even <persName corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</persName> who enjoyed adopting new concepts wrote D with a horizontal line through it during his
                  lifetime as his choice for a distinct symbol for dollar, obviously having been influenced by the horizontal line or lines used in the British
                  monetary symbol £. Neither he nor his contemporaries seem to have commented upon the use of the $ sign even though some of them used it.</p>
               <p>In the eastern portion of the English Colonies in <placeName>North America</placeName> prior to the American Revolution, there was no
                  critical need to have a practical symbol to refer to the dollar because it was not a primary or official monetary unit except to some extent
                  in <persName>Maryland</persName> beginning in 1767. Even though the dollar was a commonly used expression for a Spanish or Spanish
                  American peso as a trade coin and as a standard of exchange value it was not the basic unit for American prices and bookkeeping. The decimal
                  system as to amounts less than one dollar was not then used. During the American Revolution the <pb n="5"/> Continental Congress and the
                  independent states spread the use of the dollar as a bookkeeping unit by issuing paper money in dollar denominations to try to create economic
                  uniformity and stability. In 1782, after the end of military action, Gouverneur <persName>Morris</persName>, through <persName>Robert Morris</persName>, recommended a dollar of 1440 mills as a basis for money of account for all states with a new 1000 mill Federal coin
                  of proportionately lower value as the largest silver coin.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref>
                  <persName corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</persName> and others felt this to be impractical. The <placeName>United
                     States</placeName> on July 6, 1785, adopted the dollar both as a monetary standard and as the largest silver coin, the cent becoming the
                  dollar's basic decimal subdivision. Thus the broader need to use a distinctive symbol for the dollar became even more essential because of the
                  official federal abandonment of all money of account systems in coinage plans. Such a symbol, the $ sign, was already developed and in use by
                  English speaking merchants along the northern coast of the Gulf of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName> but minimally
                  elsewhere in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. Since habits of people in writing and bookkeeping are particularly slow to change,
                  the acceptance and use of the $ sign had a gradual metamorphosis in the <placeName>United States</placeName> thereafter.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Florian Cajori</persName> (1858-1930), a professor of mathematics, physics and engineering who taught at Tulane University, The
                  Colorado College and the University of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> (<persName corresp="#geonames_5327684">Berkeley</persName>), is responsible for initiating and vigorously continuing a factual study of the history of the
                  $ sign. Prior to his research the many theories which abounded had no probative support. In a 1912 article, <persName>Cajori</persName>
                  published an assembly of peso or dollar marks from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries from various parts of the world (<ref target="fig-2">fig. 1</ref>).<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> He showed in a chart that the abbreviation for the plural of pesos was written
                  in various ways and that the s in the abbreviation ps was often at a level above the p. He also pointed out that the handwriting of the
                  abbreviation ps often was done in one stroke of the pen and that a capital P was not customary. He noticed that in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName> until after independence from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> in 1821
                  the Mexicans continued to use the abbreviation ps for pesos as they had done in the eighteenth century.</p>
               <p>He concluded that the $ sign was developed about 1775 in <placeName>North America</placeName> by English speaking Americans who were in
                  business contact with Spanish speaking Americans and that the earliest known written use of the $ sign was by <persName corresp="#viaf_39226683">Oliver Pollock</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> in an August 29,
                  1778 letter to <persName corresp="#viaf_37727497">George Rogers Clark</persName>. He also stated that the first printed use of the $ sign

                  <persName>Cajori</persName> detailed data provided by August <persName>H. Fiske</persName> from the diary of <persName corresp="#viaf_73796933">Ezra L'Hommedieu</persName>, an attorney of Southhold, <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New
                     York</placeName>, who was a deputy from <persName>Suffolk County</persName> to the Provincial Assembly of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> (after July 9, 1776, Convention of Representatives of the State of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName>) and attended meetings at <persName>Poughkeepsie</persName>, <persName>White Plains</persName>, and <persName>Fishkill</persName> from June 10 to December 5, 1776.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>L'Hommedieu's</persName> entries include items in pounds and shillings (<placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> money of account rather than sterling) and dollars. Dollar amounts are spelled out until August 21, 1776, when there
                  appears "Treasurer to advance <persName>Captain Wismer</persName> $580 for bounty." On August 24, 1776, there is a reversion to "<persName>Hugh Doyle</persName> is to receive 8 dollars." Then on August 28, 1776, "the treasurer is to advance $10 for removing military
                  stores from <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName>" is entered. Then follow many uses of the $ sign. Up to
                  October 31, 1776, a single stroke crosses the S while thereafter two strokes are used. These entries moved the earliest use of the $ sign to
                  1776 and geographically distant from Spanish speaking areas (<ref target="fig-3">fig. 2</ref>).</p>

               </figure>
               <p>In a 1925 article, <persName>Cajori</persName> corrects himself about the first $ sign in print being in <persName>Chauncey
                     Lee's</persName> 1797 publication.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> He emphasizes the differences in <persName>Lee's</persName> symbols from
                  the conventional version already in use before 1797 and assumes that Lee knew what was then in use. <persName>Cajori</persName> is thus
                  the first to emphasize that <persName>Lee's</persName> symbols are unrelated to the conventional $ sign, but he does not consider the
                  probability that <persName>Lee</persName> could have been entirely unfamiliar with the conventional $ sign. <persName>Lee's</persName> publication will be detailed subsequently herein.</p>
               <p>In 1929, <persName>Cajori</persName> again updated his research,<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> presenting a slave sale document in Spanish
                  from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</placeName>, dated April 1, 1778, in which the amount of 478 pesos, 5 reales, 16

               <p>This item shows the $ sign being used as a repetition of ps for plural purposes and follows it with a double r for pluralizing the
                  abbreviation for reales. <persName>Cajori</persName> repeats his prior findings and reconfirms them. When <persName>Florian
                     Cajori</persName> died in 1930 he had passed forward a heritage of accurate information on the $ sign which others might build upon.</p>

               <p>By the secret Treaty of <persName>Fontainebleau</persName> on November 3, 1762 (the formal Treaty of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> was signed February 10, 1763), the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName>
                  Territory on the west side of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> River and the area surrounding <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> on the east side was transferred from <persName>France</persName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, while the balance of the French territory on the east side of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> River was added to the English colonies in <persName>America</persName>. The Spanish also yielded East and West
                     <persName>Florida</persName> to the English. The English obtained non-exclusive navigation rights on the entire <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> River. The news of the Treaty did not reach <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> until
                  September 1764. Naturally the French then lost interest in the administration of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> Territory area and left it to the Spanish to redeem the outstanding French paper money obligations there. American
                  colonial traders, many from the Atlantic seaboard, promptly moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> in
                  the new Spanish Territory and to <persName>Florida</persName> Gulf of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName> ports
                  in the new English territory to take advantage of the slack in commercial activity due to the changes in ownership. A few established
                  themselves upstream on the rivers on which furs were shipped. The Spanish were slow to take over administration of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> Territory and in 1766 sent Antoine de Ulloa to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> as Governor without adequate support or supplies. He retained many French officials and
                  was ejected in the <pb n="9"/> local revolt of 1768. In August 1769, however, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> sent
                  in <persName>Alejandro O'Reilly</persName> as Governor with adequate military and economic backing to enforce Spanish control.</p>
               <p>Under the prior French administration of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> Territory the livre was used as
                  the basic unit of money of account in commerce. The livre and its fractions were not represented by any French specie coin but by deerskin and
                  other skins as commodities and by balances on account books of merchants and traders. There was also paper money consisting of card money,
                  treasury notes, promissory notes, certificates of credit and bons. In view of intermittent French colonial inflation and fluctuations in the
                  value of skins there were customary negotiated conversion rates of the livre into the piastre (the dollar or peso).</p>
               <p>By 1769 the English traders who had moved into the Gulf areas were dominating the exports and imports, primarily using the peso in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> Territory area as the unit of monetary value in place of the French livre. Thus
                  the livre as a money of account began a lingering phase-out in the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> Valley and the peso solidified itself
                  there both as a specie coin and as the monetary unit for bookkeeping purposes. West <persName>Florida</persName> being formerly Spanish
                  territory routinely continued its peso usage. The English colonies on the North American Atlantic coast were primarily using and continued to
                  use pounds, shillings and pence as their several moneys of account with various exchange value ratios to the peso or Spanish dollar. During
                  the American Revolution, the Continental Currency of the United Colonies (<placeName>United States</placeName> after July 1776) and the
                  paper money of some of the independent American States selected the "Spanish dollar" as their monetary unit for paper money and to some extent
                  their money of account practices even though there were few Spanish silver dollars in circulation.</p>
               <p>Governor <persName>O'Reilly</persName> recognized the domination of trade and the smuggling practices of the English colonists operating
                  their trading establishments in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> and promptly ordered them to leave the
                  Spanish area on September 2, 1769. Many of them moved to Mobile, <persName>Pensacola</persName> and inland locations in British owned
                  West <persName>Florida</persName> and continued their trade. This greatly increased the use of a special route to transport merchandise
                  up and down most of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> River without passing by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New
                     Orleans</placeName> where inspection and fees were imposed by the Spanish. There was a way to leave the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>
                  River at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4332451">Bayou Manchac</placeName> (then also known as the <placeName>Iberville
                  River</placeName>) 8 miles south of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4315588">Baton Rouge</placeName>, continue eastwardly along <placeName corresp="#geonames_4332451">Bayou Manchac</placeName> to the <persName>Amite River</persName>, and then proceed southerly through <persName>Lake Maurepas</persName> and <persName>Lake Ponchartrain</persName> into the Gulf of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName>. <pb n="10"/> This route was a bypass from all of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> River
                  Valley slightly north of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> to the Gulf of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName>, the bypass being entirely under British jurisdiction at that time.</p>
               <p>One of the expelled English colonists was <persName>John Fitzpatrick</persName>. He was born in <persName>Waterford,
                     Ireland</persName> in 1737. He served three and a half years as an English colonial ranger under <persName>Robert Rogers</persName> during
                  the French and Indian War. In 1762 he was a trader in the Illinois area working for <persName>Oakes &amp; Goddard</persName>. He was
                  captured by native Americans but escaped. In 1764 he visited Mobile in West <persName>Florida</persName>, returning to <persName>Illinois</persName> in 1765. When he moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> is not certain but he was
                  well established there by 1768. When he was ordered to leave in 1769, he tried to liquidate his assets and pay his debts, but left for Mobile
                  on September 21, 1769, before that could be accomplished. He arranged to open a store on high ground at <persName>Manchac</persName>
                     (<persName>Fort Bute</persName>) at the juncture of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4332451">Bayou Manchac</placeName> and the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> River and moved there by February 15, 1770. His friend <persName>Isaac Monsanto</persName> who was
                  also expelled from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> already had opened a store in <persName>Manchac</persName>. <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> lived in <persName>Manchac</persName> during the Revolutionary War and the
                  subsequent Spanish occupation until his death on March 20, 1791. His wife survived until 1797 and all their assets were sold to pay debts—all
                  except an unsalable chest of papers and records containing his business letterbooks which have turned out to be the major resource for the
                  history of the $ sign.</p>
               <p>There are almost 1,000 commercial letters copied by <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> and his clerks into the letterbooks. They are
                  written at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> from June 13, 1768 through September 21, 1769, at Mobile from
                  November 7, 1769 through December 12, 1769, and at <persName>Manchac</persName> from February 15, 1770 through May 21, 1790. Most of the
                  letters are to merchants in <persName>Pensacola</persName>, Mobile, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>
                  and <persName>Natchez</persName>. Some are to traders in towns along the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> River and its tributaries.
                  They are replete with prices, accounts due, accounts receivable, exchange matters, note obligations, expenses, calculations and other money
                  matters. They are almost all in English (a few in French), full of spelling and grammatical errors, colloquial expressions and with Spanish,
                  English, French and American monetary abbreviations and symbols galore. <persName>Florian Cajori</persName> was unaware of the existence
                  of the letterbooks.</p>
               <p>In 1978 <persName>Margaret Fisher Dalrymple</persName> completed a study of the <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> letterbooks and the
                  text of each letter was published by the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> State University Press along with her
                  historical introduction, glossary, etc.<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> Given that the condition of the letterbooks was mediocre, her ability to
                  decipher crudely penned backwoods English was outstanding. She included symbols and abbreviations as written, <pb n="11"/> unveiling the
                  amazing facility of her hard working merchant pauper to demonstrate the convenience and practicality of the $ sign and his part in developing
                  it as early as June 30, 1768 (<ref target="fig-5">fig. 4</ref>).</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-5">
                  <graphic url="COAC9_011.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>The use of the $ sign in early manuscript communications is complicated by the fact that often the only known written text is not necessarily
                  written by the signer of the letter or by the preparer of a retained copy in a letterbook or otherwise. The scribe or secretary sometimes
                  wrote the letter and it was then signed by the principal. On other occasions the principal wrote and signed the entire letter and the scribe
                  or secretary prepared necessary duplicates which were sent in case of loss of the original or which were for retention or both. It seems
                  reasonable to presume that duplicates or copies <pb n="12"/> prepared by scribes customarily repeated the symbols as originally written
                  because any changes might be considered inaccurate and subject to criticism. The important fact is that both sender and receiver of a
                  communication understood the symbols which were used. The $ sign would not have been used by the sender if the receiver would not have fully
                  understood it. As its convenience was recognized it was used more and more by senders and spread to others who at first were reluctant to use
                  it.</p>
               <p>In the <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> letterbooks most of the copies of the letters are in <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName>'s own
                  hand, an indication that he also wrote those original letters.</p>
               <p>From the beginning of the letterbooks in 1768, <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> uses a special symbol for dollars which is not "pS". It
                  is used over 1,000 times in his letterbooks. It is created with one continuous stroke going downward obliquely to the left, then continuing
                  upwardly for an equal distance near the left side of the downstroke and finally obliquely downward to the right in a reversing curve across
                  the other two parts of the symbol. The lower portions of p in pS are evident in the first downward and upward portions of the stroke. The
                  final part of the stroke is an S curve. There is no trace of the top loop of the p. The S curve is superimposed on the two other portions of
                  the stroke.</p>
               <p>There has been nothing located prior to 1776 to compare with these symbols. They could not have been related to U S because there was no <placeName>United States</placeName> at that time. The joinder at the bottom of the first two parts of the symbol dismisses any relationship
                  to the parallel Pillars of Hercules on the coinage. All uses by <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> of his special symbol were to represent
                  the dollar. The convenience and clarity of the form of this symbol is obvious. The fact that the top loop of the p is omitted might not by
                  itself be considered by some as sufficient to make the <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> symbol distinctive, but the superimposition of
                  the S over the two lower portions of the p is the major additional change of form. <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> never had to explain
                  the meaning of his symbols to anyone in his correspondence and his addressees clearly understood what he was using. Whether he learned from
                  others the symbol he used or vice versa does not detract from his own extensive use of it.</p>
               <p>Symbols and abbreviations for dollars and pesos are often used interchangeably in the letterbooks with a lack of uniformity in placement
                  relative to the numerals indicating the amount. In a <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> letter written July 17, 1769, from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> to a merchant at Mobile "71½ Ds," "$ 164.6½," and "Ds 401:4" are all written
                  in the first paragraph. In another letter to <persName>Pensacola</persName> on the same date <pb n="13"/> the abbreviation "ps" has two
                  different meanings when sail cloth "was charged 5 ps per yard which is $ 15 Ds per ps," with "ps" first used meaning dollars and then meaning
                  piece. The plural of pieces is sometimes abbreviated in the letterbooks as "pss" to distinguish it from money.</p>
               <p>On May 9, 1771, a letter from <persName>Manchac</persName> to <persName>Pensacola</persName> again has different symbols with the
                  same meaning in the same sentence when <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> writes "Amounts to ps 337.2r of which there is for you $137.2r
                  and the other $200 for <persName>Mr. John Stephensons Accot</persName>." On November 9, 1771, a <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName>
                  letter from <persName>Manchac</persName> to Mobile includes "$24 Ds."</p>
               <p>In a July 19, 1772 <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> letter, a price was described as "some at 8½ $ and Others at 9 Dollers." In another
                  letter dated October 7, 1773, an amount is written as "$ 5 Dollers," showing the same monetary standard on each side of the numerals, but in
                  different form. In a May 17, 1769 <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> letter written from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> to a <persName>Pensacola</persName> merchant, it is stated that "It will be 1½ Dollar for the Corn and Barrel here
                  if shipped in this place, and if obliged to send it to the Bayoux will stand you in $ 1 - 6. Exclusive of freight." On October 20, 1772, "$
                  159. 1½" and "Ds 159.6½r" are both used referring to the same group of merchandise.</p>
               <p>While the amount of reals is often indicated only with punctuation following dollar amounts, sometimes both dollars and reals are specifically
                  designated with variations such as a redundance in February 1771, using "$ 128.4½rs In hard Dollers" and a partial use of symbols in "383
                  Dollers 1½rs" on July 19, 1772.</p>
               <p>In addition to what is heretofore shown, the $ sign occasionally follows an amount in the manner spoken, such as "35 $" on September 28, 1768,
                  "8½ $" on July 19, 1772, "2242 $" on December 6, 1776, and "2 $" and "1 $" on July 8, 1777.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName>'s facility in using seven different money symbols and abbreviations is demonstrated in a November 21,
                  1776 letter from <persName>Manchac</persName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4315588">Baton Rouge</placeName> in which he calculated
                  the exchange value of 6 pounds, 5 shillings, 4 pence in English Sterling into dollars and reals at the rate of 4 shillings, 8 pence Sterling
                  per dollar. It may also be observed how similar his abbreviation for "per" is to the common use of "ps" as a symbol for "pesos" (<ref target="fig-6">fig. 5</ref>).</p>
               <p>Those whose native language was Spanish had remained satisfied in the eighteenth century with the abbreviation ps or pS for peso but for
                  convenience in foreign trade sometimes used the $ sign as well. Just as in the 1778 <persName>Puerto Rican</persName> slave sale document
                  previously illustrated, there is a May 4, 1778 letter written by a scribe from Spanish Governor <persName>Estevan Miro</persName> at
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> to <persName corresp="#viaf_12739331">Thomas McKean</persName>
                  <pb n="14"/> in <persName>Philadelphia</persName> with an amount written in numerals followed by a repetition of the same double
                  symbol.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-6">
                  <graphic url="COAC9_014a.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>It is "30355 pS $" and has the capital S in pS in script rather than in Roman style (<ref target="fig-7">fig. 6</ref>).</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-7">
                  <graphic url="COAC9_014b.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>This also conforms to the custom in the Spanish language of repeating abbreviations to designate plurals. The abbreviations E.E.U.U. for
                  Estados Unidos (<placeName>United States</placeName>), F.F.C.C. for Ferrocarriles (Railroads) and F.F.A.A. for Fuerzas Armadas (Armed
                  Forces) are examples. Thus the duplication of the monetary symbols in the above examples may have been a means of indicating the plural, even
                  though the S in the peso abbreviation and the S in the $ sign both originally indicated the plural form.</p>
               <p>After <persName>Mexican</persName> Independence the occasional use of the $ sign for the <persName>Mexican</persName> peso began
                  within <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName> as shown by a document for "cinco mil pesos" dated October 1, 1822, with a
                  clearly written conventional $ sign (<ref target="fig-8">fig. 7</ref>).</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Differences in Value of Reals (Reales)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Some of the <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> letters to merchants in Mobile and <persName>Pensacola</persName> in West <persName>Florida</persName> show that 10 reals were equal to one dollar in that region as well as in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> instead of 8 reals to one dollar used by <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> when he
                  was in <persName>Manchac</persName>. This differential had arisen due to the minting in <persName>Iberian Spain</persName>,
                  beginning in 1707, of a debased 2 real coinage and its fractions having about 20% less silver than prior coinage while generally retaining the
                  same size by adulteration. The debased 2 real coin was called a "pistareen" but retained the 2 real denomination in its legend for many years
                  thereafter. No such reduction in silver content took place in coinage in Spanish American mints. Much of the debased 2 real coinage naturally
                  came to America replacing some of the full weight 2 real and other denominations in circulation. When this intrinsic value deficiency became a
                  problem, American merchants had a choice of pricing less expensive items in reals at the rate of 8 to the dollar or adjusting prices to a 10
                  reals to the dollar basis. It depended upon whether pistareens were being accepted at their face value of 2 reals in small transactions or at
                  a 20% discounted value. Some regions used one practice and some the other. This had the effect of complicating addition and multiplication for
                  merchants doing business in regions using different money of account valuations. Once the dollar or peso total had been arrived at on either
                  basis any payment in coin required discounting of only pistareens from their full value. The <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> letterbooks
                  elucidate the real to the dollar practice. For example "$881.8½ r" is written in a June 30, 1768 letter from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>; "$187.9¼" is written in an April 13, 1769 letter from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>; and "$260.8¼ rs" in a June 4, 1770 letter from Mobile. No letters have portions of a
                  dollar written as 10 or more. <pb n="16"/> Totals with portions of a dollar exceeding 8 reals indicate the use of a 10 real ratio to the
                  dollar. In letters sent from <persName>Manchac</persName> to <persName>Peter Swanson</persName> in Mobile dated May 31, 1770, and to
                     <persName>Thomas Walters</persName> in <persName>Pensacola</persName> dated October 4, 1777, <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> uses the expression "your money" to refer to a 10 reals to the dollar basis.</p>
               <p>In a letter to <persName>John Ritson</persName> in <persName>Pensacola</persName> dated May 11, 1770, a calculation on the basis of
                  10 reals to the dollar is as follows with an unusual spelling of doubloons:</p>

               <p>In a letter from <persName>Manchac</persName> to Mobile dated August 30, 1770, <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName>, using the word bit
                  meaning real, stated as to shelled corn per barrel "I can have delivered me here at 10 bits this currency say 12½ bits your money ..." showing
                  the differential in value of reals in the two regions. If a cash payment was made in a 10 real to the dollar region, full weight Spanish

                  rate of 5 pistareens to the dollar.</p>

Data for each type of item included in each container is listed in
                  a separate horizontal line as was customary. The number of pieces was entered first, then a description of the item, next the unit price of
                  the item, followed by the aggregate charge for all of <pb n="17"/> the same items. To the left of each unit price is the symbol a or @ for at.
                  The unit price is in dollars except that if the unit price is less than a full dollar the price is listed in reals. The reals are abbreviated
                  with r or R to the right of the numerals constituting the price in reals and the dollars are symbolized by a $ sign to the right of the
                  numerals for the price in dollars. The subtotal of aggregate charges for the content of each container is set out in a line further to the
                  right and a page total is at the bottom of those subtotals. The page total is carried forward to the top of the following page. Each page
                  total and each carry forward total has a $ sign to the left of the numerals and punctuation at the end of the full amount of dollars. If a
                  portion of a dollar results, that portion is entered in reals without further designation. The invoice contains 73 of the conventional $
                  signs.</p>
               <p>The placement of the $ sign on the right side of numerals used for pricing and on the left side of numerals used for totals shows practicality
                  as the motivation for so doing. The customary use of r or R for reals on the right side of a unit price when reals were the basis for that
                  price avoided interference or confusion with the a or @. The $ was similarly placed on the right side of a price when price was equal to or
                  exceeded one dollar. When totals were calculated the result was always in dollars and the $ sign was placed on the left side of the numerals
                  to avoid confusion with a dollar amount which in many instances included a fractional part of a dollar expressed in reals. Since Spanish
                  American silver coins in circulation had denominations only in reals (1/8th dollar per real for full weight pieces), punctuation was used to
                  separate the whole dollar amounts from the reals in a total. Maravedis as a subdivision of reals were too insignificant to include but the
                  occasional use of additional punctuation shows that the <persName>clerk</persName> had been accustomed to using maravedis.</p>

               <p>During the American Revolution, Oliver Pollock was working in New Orleans (then Spanish Territory) as a secret United States commercial agent.
                  His biographer, James Alton James, infers that Pollock was a developer of the $ sign.x<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Pollock had come to
                  America from Coleraine, Ireland, in 1760, at age 23. Backed by Willing and Morris of Philadelphia, in 1763, he became a ship operating trader
                  headquartered in Havana, Cuba, dealing extensively in rum, coffee, flour, lumber, spices, slaves, etc., with merchants at east coast American
                  ports. He became fluent in Spanish. In 1768 he moved his headquarters to New Orleans and established trade with other Gulf ports and the
                  Mississippi Valley. When Alejandro O'Reilly came to New Orleans on August 17, 1769, in a second Spanish attempt to administer the region, he
                  needed a substantial amount of flour and <pb n="20"/>
                  <persName>Pollock</persName> supplied it at normal prices instead of opportunistically increasing his profit by raising prices. This
                  action put <persName>Pollock</persName> in a favored position for the future there. When the American Revolution began <persName>Pollock</persName> furnished the Americans with information and supplies and helped to keep <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> cooperating with the Americans.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>James</persName>, who was familiar with the <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> letterbooks, construes <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName>'s $ signs as transitional rather than a true $ sign. However the letter dated January 20, 1780, from <persName>Pollock</persName> to Congress is definitely written by <persName>Pollock</persName> personally and shows that <persName>Pollock</persName> himself was using a transitional form (<ref target="fig-13">fig. 12</ref>).</p>

               <p>In a September 18, 1782 letter from <persName>Pollock</persName> to Congress handwritten by a scribe but signed by <persName>Pollock</persName> and obviously composed by <persName>Pollock</persName>, "Dollars" is used after numerals 14 times, "Drs" is used after
                  a number once but nowhere is the $ sign used. Whether in one distinctive form or another, whether original or a copy, whether by the writer or
                  by a scribe, the important point is that the receiver of any such communication at the time understood what the sender meant by using the $
                  sign. <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName> had already written to <persName>Pollock</persName> on December 1, 1775, using the $ sign
                  once and on October 1, 1776, using the $ sign on 4 occasions. The previously described invoice of April 1, 1778, written by <persName>Pollock's</persName> clerk, shows fully developed uniform $ signs. Apparently in 1937, when <persName>James's</persName> book about <persName>Pollock</persName> was published, James was unaware of the use of the $ sign by <persName corresp="#viaf_73796933">Ezra
                     L'Hommedieu</persName> of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> in 1776 (as disclosed in articles by <persName>Cajori</persName> in 1913 through 1929), and any claim on behalf of <persName>Pollock</persName> as the first user of the
                  conventional $ sign lacks support. Since <persName>Fitzpatrick</persName>, <persName>Pollock</persName> and many others had been
                  sending and receiving trade documents and correspondence in great quantity using the $ sign in recognizable form, they must all be given
                  credit for developing its practicality and its eventual general acceptance.</p>

               <p>Among the incomplete records of <persName>William Constable</persName> &amp; Co., a <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> trading partnership organized May 10, 1784, there remain some letters written in 1786
                  addressed to merchants in <persName>Philadelphia</persName>, West Indies ports and elsewhere which use the $ sign following the numerals
                  in amounts of money and in no instance in front of the numerals. In 1787 the $ sign sometimes appears in front of and sometimes following such
                  numerals. By 1789 the $ sign is always used in front of the numerals. Whether written by scribes or by the principals or both this evolution
                  of the positioning of the $ sign shows the timing of its change of position by commercial Americans just becoming accustomed to using it. They
                  were going through the same thinking and practices which <persName>John Fitzpatrick</persName> and others had experienced elsewhere.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <persName>Daniel McGillivray</persName> was an independent operator as well as an agent for other firms in trading with native Americans
                  in the East <persName>Florida</persName> and West <persName>Florida</persName> areas during the last quarter of the eighteenth
                  century. His wife was a native American of the Creek tribe, enabling him to furnish extensive information to the British, <placeName>United States</placeName> and Spanish authorities as to the thinking and practices of the Creeks and other tribes as well as to trade
                  extensively with them in furs and other items. His surviving account book lists prices in "chalks" during the 1788-90 period and when he
                  converts "chalk" totals into dollars and reals he uses the $ sign. Selected entries are as follows: <q>58 chalks in goods @ 3 rs ... 21..6</q>
                  <q>414 chalks reduced to dollars is $ 15 5 .3</q>
                  <q>738 chalks reduced to dollars $ is 276..6</q>
               </p>
               <p>The chalk was equivalent for trading purposes to one pound weight of dressed deerskin which was valued in full weight coin at 3 reals (3/8ths
                  dollar or 37.5 cents). Prices and accounts in trading with the Creek tribe were kept in chalks. This expression was obviously introduced to
                  the Creek and other tribes in the area by English traders who were accustomed to making a tally by chalking one up on a slate or skin or by
                  making tally marks with a stick on the ground. In two of the above entries the English word dollars was first written out and then followed
                  with a $ sign, showing that the writer was calculating in dollars and reals. He was not using decimal calculations since his parts of a dollar
                  were in reals. It can be noted that the $ sign is used in two different positions.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In the past there has been a broad difference of opinion on the source of the printed form of the true or conventional $ sign. This has
                  occurred primarily because some printed items had not yet been located and certain historical data as to American type founders had been
                  misapplied.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Lee's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">The American Accomptant,</hi> published in 1797, contained the earliest known illustration of a <placeName>United
                     States</placeName> coin in its frontispiece.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>The book proposed five different symbols for monetary amounts to be
                  used for commercial instruction in reckoning in Federal money. These symbols were referred to by the author as "characteristics." The mill was
                  represented by a straight line running on a diagonal from upper right to lower left, being virtually identical with the then existing English
                  symbol for shilling. The symbol for the cent was created by adding another straight line of equal length running on a diagonal parallel with
                  and close to the line representing the mill. For the dime symbol a thick undulating stroke from upper left to lower right was added diagonally
                  across the center of the two parallel lines used as the symbol for the cent, the top end of the undulating stroke pointing vertically upward
                  and the bottom end of the stroke pointing vertically downward.</p>
               <p>For the dollar symbol the two parallel lines used for the cent symbol were retained as a base but a complex element from the upper left to the
                  lower right was superimposed across the center of the cent lines in similar placement to the undulating stroke used on the dime symbol. That
                  complex element in the dollar symbol resembles the outline of a short earthworm with its top end pointing vertically upward and its bottom end
                  pointing vertically downward. The designation for Ten Dollars (officially known as an Eagle) was merely the abbreviation E (<ref target="fig-14">figs. 13-15</ref>).</p>
               <p>All of these symbols were used in the calculating exercises in <persName>Lee's</persName> book after an explanation of them on page 56,
                  but in later pages the dollar symbol is retained and the others are sparsely used. There are altogether 232 uses of the dollar symbol, as many
                  as 8 being found on one page. There is no evidence that any of <persName>Lee's</persName> symbol system was ever used before or after the
                  publication of his book. <persName>Lee's</persName> use of multiple symbols seems to have been substantially influenced by the £, s, d,
                  and f, representing the pound, shilling, pence and farthing in the British-style money of account systems used in the American colonies and in
                     <persName>Lee's</persName> time still used to a great extent in the American states. Although <persName>Lee</persName> was very
                  enthusiastic about the decimal system he did not take into consideration the fact that under decimalization the official <persName>U.S</persName>. monetary units and the coins minted accordingly would eliminate the need for more than one fundamental monetary symbol
                  accompanying the numerals.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Lee's</persName> system was thus conceptually obsolete, impractical and very difficult to transcribe.</p>
               <p>It is obvious that <persName>Lee's</persName> monetary symbols were conceived by adding one line or stroke for each larger decimal unit
                  so that the dollar symbol was composed of four separate lines or strokes. His dollar symbol seems to have had no relationship to the
                  handwritten conventional $ sign which had already been in use by some merchants, bookkeepers and others for as long as 30 years in scattered
                  parts of colonial <persName>America</persName> and subsequently the United States.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Lee's</persName> symbol for the dollar was called to the attention of the numismatic public in <hi rend="italic">The
                     Numismatist</hi> for September 1899<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> and generally accepted as the first printed use of the conventional
                  dollar sign until 1925 when Professor <persName>Florian Cajori</persName> challenged it.</p>
               <p>An examination of <persName>Lee's</persName> symbols, particularly his dollar symbol, shows that they were original with him and that he
                  was not familiar with the existing conventional $ sign. Such a conclusion is reached by noting that the curving portions of his dollar symbol
                  do not conform to the Roman S in the conventional $ sign or to the old English long s. The upper end of a Roman S always points either
                  horizontally or downward and not vertically upward as <persName>Lee's</persName> strokes do. The lower end of a Roman S always points
                  either horizontally or upward and not vertically downward as <persName>Lee's</persName> strokes do. A Roman S is made with one stroke and
                  not with two separate strokes joining at each end and leaving a long enclosed area between them. The old English long s slopes from upper
                  right to lower left, greatly differing from <persName>Lee's</persName> two curving strokes sloping in an opposite direction. It seems
                  proper to conclude that <persName>Lee</persName> would have been pleased to include the conventional $ sign as his dollar symbol if he
                  had been aware of it. He would have been intellectually dishonest as an instructor and writer if he had known about the conventional $ sign
                  and had concealed that fact from those he wished to teach. His dollar symbol could not have been a partial modification of the conventional $
                  sign because his symbol for the dime resembled the conventional $ sign more closely than his dollar symbol as <persName>Cajori</persName>
                  stated. The worm-like element in <persName>Lee's</persName> dollar symbol cannot be easily handwritten but must be tediously and
                  carefully drawn and spaced to be read and to be distinguishable from his symbol for the dime.</p>
               <p>Thus it seems proper to exclude <persName>Lee's</persName> dollar symbol from being designated as the first printed use of the
                  conventional $ sign because there is no evidence that either was derived from or influenced by <pb n="25"/> the other. Granted he was the
                  first to develop a symbol for the dollar in type form rather than spelling out "dollar" or employing an abbreviation, but it appears to be an
                  isolated concept, unrelated to the prior handwritten $ sign.</p>
               <p>The maker of the type for <persName>Lee's</persName> symbols remains unknown. <persName>Christopher Sauer (Sower)</persName> began
                  his print shop in 1772 in <persName>Germantown, Pennsylvania</persName> which was sold to his assistant, <persName>Justus
                     Fox</persName> in 1784. <persName>Fox</persName> cast limited styles of type as did <persName>Jacob Bey</persName>, another assistant
                  who later operated independently. Neither was engaged in that operation by 1797. <persName>John Baine</persName> from <persName>Scotland</persName> attempted some type-founding in <persName>Philadelphia</persName> beginning in 1787 and by 1797 had gone out of
                  business as had <persName>Adam Gerard Mappa</persName> from <persName>Holland</persName> who similarly operated in <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> beginning in 1790. <persName>Henry Lewis Bullen</persName> in 1919
                  had speculated that: <q>In 1797 <persName>Archibald Binny</persName> was the only punch cutter in the <persName>U.S</persName>. and
                     doubtless cut the punches for <persName>Dr. Lee's</persName> monetary sign. B &amp; R (<persName>Binny &amp;
                     Ronaldson</persName>) was not satisfied with the sign made for <persName>Lee's</persName> book. <persName>Binny</persName> redesigned
                     the character.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This statement had no factual support. <persName>Binny</persName> had come to <persName>America</persName> from <persName>Scotland</persName> in 1793 skilled in punch cutting and matrix making for typecasting and set up in <persName>Philadelphia</persName> in
                  1796 for the purpose of casting type. His products were uniform and far superior to the symbols used in <persName>Lee's</persName>
                  book.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Updike's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Printing Types</hi> (1922) repeated <persName>Bullen's</persName> 1919 thoughts and stated: <q>Many of these small
                     equipments finally fell into the hands of two Scotchmen, Archibald <persName>Binny</persName> and <persName>James
                        Ronaldson</persName>, whose <persName>Philadelphia</persName> foundry was begun in 1796. In 1797, they offered for sale the first
                     dollar - marks ever made in type.<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>P.J. Conkwright</persName> pointed out in 1955 that this Updike comment was inaccurate and was apparently copied from <hi rend="italic">1796-1896 One Hundred Years, <persName>MacKellar</persName>, <persName>Smiths</persName> and <persName>Jordan Foundry</persName>
                  </hi>, a centennial celebration publication in 1896 of American typefounding by <persName>Thomas MacKellar</persName>, which stated: <q>
                     <persName>Binny &amp; Ronaldson</persName> first began to manufacture the dollar mark in 1797 and under date of November 13, of the
                     same year, it appears on Page 2 of Ledger A for the first time.<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>An examination of that <persName>Binny &amp; Ronaldson</persName> ledger by Conkwright showed that the dollar mark referred to was
                  handwritten as a ledger <pb n="26"/> entry and there was no evidence whatever that it was available in type. Certainly the remarks by <persName>MacKellar</persName> were restated by <persName>Bullen</persName> and <persName>Updike</persName> based upon the
                  existence of the dollar symbol in <persName>Lee's</persName> book. No other use of type for any symbol for the dollar during or prior to
                  1797 was then or is now known.</p>
               <p>The earliest printing which <persName>Conkwright</persName> had located by 1955 for the use of the conventional $ sign in type was on
                  January 2, 1802, in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Aurora</persName>
                  </hi>, a <persName>Philadelphia</persName> newspaper printed by <persName>William Duane</persName>. This is over four years after
                     <persName>Lee's</persName> publication. Unfortunately there are no known type foundry specimen sheets containing any $ sign until
                     <persName>E. White</persName> &amp; Co. (<persName>Elihu White</persName>) of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> in 1812 showed a conventional $ sign for sale on his sheet. <persName>Binny
                     &amp; Ronaldson</persName> did not list the $ sign in <hi rend="italic">A Specimen of Metal Ornaments</hi> (<persName>Philadelphia</persName> 1809) where the prices were even spelled out as "dollars" nor did they include it in their specimen book of 1812.
                     <persName>D. &amp; G. Bruce</persName> of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> City offered type
                  for the conventional $ sign in 1815. Finally <persName>James Ronaldson</persName> of <persName>Philadelphia</persName> who had
                  bought out <persName>Binny</persName> offered 10 different sizes of the conventional $ sign for sale in 1816 in his specimen sheets. The
                  omission of the conventional $ sign in a specimen sheet does not indicate that it was not available. <persName>Conkwright</persName>
                  pointed out that in the foundry equipment of <persName>Binny &amp; Ronaldson</persName> there actually was a matrix to cast type for the
                  identical $ sign used beginning in 1802 to print the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> newspaper <persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Aurora.</hi>
                  </persName> This original copper matrix was retained by American Type Founders' Company and is presently at the National Museum of American
                  History. The recent discovery of the use in 1799 of type from this identical matrix is explained subsequently.</p>
               <p>It was also asserted by <persName>Conkwright</persName> in 1955 that each of <persName>Lee's</persName> printed dollar symbols
                  differs from the others in size and shape. He also claimed that each piece of type used to print them was separately engraved. It is obvious
                  that they were not cast in type metal from a matrix or they would all be virtually identical. They are crudely done. If each piece of type for
                  the dollar symbol had been separately engraved it would have been a most laborious task and most impractical. The same would have been true
                  for the dime symbol.</p>
               <p>An examination of the several type fonts used in setting the general text of <persName>Lee's</persName> book indicates that the type he
                  used was purchased from <persName>London</persName>, England, as proven by an examination of the 1788 <hi rend="italic">Specimen of
                     Printing Types</hi> by <persName>Edmund Fry and Co</persName>. <persName>Fry</persName> also had many ornaments and insignia for
                  sale but not any of <persName>Lee's</persName> money symbols. <persName>Wands</persName>, as printer of <persName>Lee's</persName> book, had been in the printing business in <persName>Lansingburgh</persName> since at least 1792 (<persName>Tiffany &amp; Wands</persName> was the printer of circulating scrip in 1792 issued by the <persName>Lansingburgh</persName>
                  <pb n="27"/> Museum) and it was then customary for American printers to buy their type from European sources. If <persName>Wands</persName> had obtained the unusual symbols for <persName>Lee</persName> from a European type founder they would have been uniform
                  but the expense and delay of such a special order would have made it impractical. Thus he seems to have found another way to create them.</p>
               <p>The handwritten entries in the 1797-1801 ledgers of <persName>Binny &amp; Ronaldson</persName> list 144 different customers for type
                  throughout the <placeName>United States</placeName> and <persName>William W. Wands</persName> is not among them.</p>
               <p>There are 232 dollar insignia in the <persName>Wands</persName> printing of <persName>Lee's</persName> 312 page book. The size is
                  duodecimo (about 7″ × 4″). It would have been customary for some of the type for the dollar insignia and other unique insignia to be reused
                  just as other type would have been reused in setting a book printed in parts. The printed collation or signature marks used on the pages to
                  guide the binder in the signature assembly of <persName>Lee's</persName> book are alternatively every 4 and 8 pages (A followed by Al; B
                  followed by B1; etc.), making it clear that 12 pages were first printed in one impression on a single sheet. When that sheet was rotated 180
                  degrees on its central axis, another impression would be made on the other side so that there would be two identical sets of 12 pages on the
                  sheet. This sheet was cut in half and each half cut into unequal parts for customary folding into 4 and 8 page alternating sections. Thus when
                  the scheduled number of a sheet impression was printed, the type could be released and reused in setting further text. The maximum number of
                  dollar insignia in any 12 page impression was 20 (pages 228 through 240) and if reused no more were required. If type for another 12 page
                  impression was being set while the prior 12 page make-up was in press, then more type would have had to be on hand. The question left
                  unanswered is how 20 or more different pieces of type for the dollar insignia and a lesser number of different pieces for the dime insignia
                  were prepared in a way which resulted in all of them being somewhat different. The special insignia could have been cast in molds which often
                  broke after each lead pouring. This might be true of clay or plaster molds which still retained some moisture after drying and usually cracked
                  from the heat of the hot type metal. This was the problem <persName>Benjamin Franklin</persName> had encountered in inventing nature
                  printing in 1737 and by <persName>William Ged</persName> of <persName>Edinburgh, Scotland</persName>, in trying to perfect
                  stereotyping in 1739.</p>
               <p>If each soft mold had been formed with one punch carved out of wood or lead the resulting cast insignia would be generally uniform. If each
                  soft mold would have been formed with the use of more than one punch, variances would occur. Pieces of cast type <pb n="28"/> on hand could
                  have been modified to make two or more punches for the different parts of <persName>Lee's</persName> dollar insignia. The use of
                  available cast type would also give a standard depth to any such impression in clay or plaster.</p>
               <p>A possibility for such punches is the modification of the section mark (§) which has a worm-like central portion with pointed or rounded ends
                  and curled tails at the top and bottom. It was routinely sold by English typecasters to American printers during the eighteenth century. In
                  addition to its normal use it was also used for borders and decorations. Paper money printed on behalf of American colonies and independent
                  states such as <persName>Virginia</persName>, <persName>North Carolina</persName> and <persName>Maryland</persName> has many
                  such marks, the 15 shilling and £ 3 denominations of the <persName>North Carolina</persName> issue of April 23, 1761, each having a total
                  of 83 of such § marks divided into two sizes. The tails and other portions of the section marks could easily have been cut off or filed off
                  such cast type to form one or more punches to be used to form the worm-like portion of <persName>Lee's</persName> dollar insignia. Then
                  an additional piece of cast type containing a line or parallel lines could be used diagonally so as to form the balance of <persName>Lee's</persName> dollar insignia in the soft mold. A number of such molds could be made at one time prior to drying and pouring or could have
                  been made as needed depending upon mold fracturing. <persName>Wands</persName> as printer could have undertaken a project of this nature
                  in his shop.</p>
               <p>While it may be unscientific to speculate on what caused the individual differences in the dollar and other monetary insignia used in <persName>Lee's</persName> book, the omission of such suggested possibilities might be neglectful. Further findings in this regard can
                  hopefully be anticipated.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Facts Respecting the Bank of North America</hi>,<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref> there are 14 printed
                  conventional $ signs in identical form and followed by numerals. This eight-page pamphlet is undated and without an indicated author. The $
                  sign has two very close diagonal parallel strokes tilting from upper right to lower left across a well-formed S (<ref target="fig-15">fig.
                     16</ref>). The date of the printing of the pamphlet must be determined from its content.</p>
               <p>The <persName>Pennsylvania</persName> charter of the reincorporated Bank of <placeName>North America</placeName> was to expire on
                  March 17, 1801, unless further extended by a <persName>Pennsylvania</persName> enactment. The text of the pamphlet covers the history of
                  the <persName>Bank of North America</persName>, describing its patriotic assistance to the Federal government and its loans to the State
                  of <pb n="29"/>
                  <persName>Pennsylvania</persName> in 1782, 1791 and 1792. The pamphlet states that there is no reason for the dissolution of the Bank and
                  that "it may not be improper to make some observations on the application for a renewal of the charter" and "when the Legislature is informed
                  of these services and of the great number of citizens interested in the institution, it is hoped they will grant a renewal of the charter
                  ...."</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-15">
                  <graphic url="COAC9_029.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>The records show that the initial motion to extend the Bank's charter was submitted to the <persName>Pennsylvania</persName> House of
                  Representatives in <persName>Philadelphia</persName> on February 5, 1799. Legislation to extend the charter for 14 additional years was
                  fully enacted and approved by March 20, 1799. The pamphlet would only have been useful if printed between those dates. It would not have been
                  printed earlier because it refers to the "application" for renewal of the charter.</p>
               <p>The pamphlet was separately printed in <persName>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</persName> by <persName>John Wyeth</persName>, and in
                     <persName>Lancaster, Pennsylvania</persName> by <persName>William Dickson</persName> (<persName>Dixon</persName>). The text
                  is exactly the same in each. The type used in each pamphlet was set independently from completely different type fonts except for the $ signs
                  which were type cast from a single or identical brass matrix. <persName>Wyeth</persName> capitalizes the first "A" of <persName>America</persName> in "<persName>Bank of North America"</persName>, while <persName>Dickson</persName> uses a hyphen after "North"
                  and a lower case "a" in "america." The pamphlets show some variances in line breaks. No other printings of this pamphlet are known,
                  particularly none were from <persName>Philadelphia</persName>.</p>
               <p>There must have been a good reason for these two virtually identical printings. The <persName>Philadelphia</persName> business interests
                  were naturally in favor of the Bank continuing. The affirmative vote of the rural legislators was needed for passage. <persName>John
                     Wyeth</persName> published a newspaper <hi rend="italic">(<persName>The Oracle of Dauphin</persName>)</hi> in <persName>Harrisburg</persName> and had distribution capabilities in that part of the state. <persName>William Dickson</persName>, a political- <pb n="30"/> ly active printer in <persName>Lancaster</persName> (which was about to become the new capital of <persName>Pennsylvania</persName>), had a different range of contacts. Each printer would therefore be able to reach different groups. It would not be
                  politically tactful to ask either printer to distribute something printed by another printer. The removal of the capital of the State of <persName>Pennsylvania</persName> from <persName>Philadelphia</persName> to <persName>Lancaster</persName> was then under
                  consideration and was approved in <persName>Philadelphia</persName> on April 4, 1799. The first legislative session in <persName>Lancaster</persName> took place on November 5, 1799. This indicated the political importance of <persName>Dickson's</persName> selection
                  for printing the pamphlets he distributed.</p>
               <p>The fact that identical well formed $ signs are found in each printing points to the nearby type founders, <persName>Binny &amp;
                     Ronaldson</persName>, of <persName>Philadelphia</persName>, whose steel punched brass matrix of that identical $ sign still exists. This
                  is further confirmed by handwritten <persName>Binny &amp; Ronaldson</persName> ledger entries of the 1796-1801 period where both <persName>Wyeth</persName> and <persName>Dixon</persName> are separately listed as customers. No <persName>Philadelphia</persName>
                  newspaper or other American publication appears to have used any $ sign in print prior to the 1799 pamphlets, so that date of February 1799
                  may be accepted as the first printed use of a conventional $ sign until new facts may show otherwise.</p>
               <p>The earliest use of the <persName>Binny &amp; Ronaldson</persName> $ sign heretofore pointed out by others has been in the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> newspaper <persName>

               <p>It seems very curious that the casting of type for printing the $ sign in 1799 took place before any special type for printing the English <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> sign had been cast anywhere, even though the <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> sign had been used in printing in <persName>Great Britain</persName> and elsewhere long beforehand. The printing of the <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> sign had been
                  accomplished by inverting a <persName>Janson</persName> style J as shown in <ref target="fig-18">fig. 19</ref>. This inversion can be
                  observed on the 1757 paper money printed in and issued by the colonies of <persName>North Carolina</persName> and <persName>Virginia</persName> from <persName>Janson</persName> type imported from Britain.</p>

                  the Continental Congress in 1775, and by most of the individual States during the Revolutionary War and Confederation period, there were no $
                  signs used on the currency. The dollar monetary unit was always expressed in lettering reading DOLLAR(S) or an abbreviation of it, whether
                  type set, engraved into a printing plate or in a cut or block inserted into a printing form. No dollar coinage was issued by any of those
                  governments prior to the adoption of the <persName>U.S</persName>. Constitution in 1789 except the pattern or trial strikings of 1776

                  in 1787 and 1788 struck copper cents and half cents, but these denominations used the word CENT and had no reason to refer to the dollar.</p>
               <p>The official loan documents of the Continental Congress and the individual states for the period of the American Revolution and until the
                  adoption of the <persName>U.S</persName>. Constitution were sometimes in dollars or Spanish dollars and whether handwritten, typeset, or
                  engraved none have been located which contain a printed or handwritten $ sign. In such obligations and documents the amount was customarily in
                  handwritten form in the text and was often duplicated elsewhere on the document in numerical form for convenience.</p>
               <p>In a January 20, 1791 typeset printed receipt form of the <persName>U.S</persName>. Commissioner of Loans in Boston, the amount of the

                  dash between them. There is a typeset combining symbol printed as an alteration protector to the left of the space for the handwritten
                  numbers. When the numbers are totalled below in handwritten numerals within printed horizontal lines the word "Dollars" is printed well to the

                  <persName>Virginia</persName>" in the amount of "One Hundred &amp; Eighty five dollars &amp; Ninety eight cents Assumed Debt." The quoted
                  portions are handwritten. In the lower left corner the amount is repeated in handwriting as "$ 185" followed first by "Dollars" printed from
                  an engraved block and then by a handwritten "&amp; 98 Cts." The $ sign is written with a single upright (<ref target="fig-20">fig.

               <p>Most subsequent <placeName>United States</placeName> Loan Office certificates, where the amount is required to be written in, also have a
                  repetition of the amount in written numerical form in the lower left corner with the word DOLLARS printed in an engraved ornamental frame.
                  When the amount is handwritten to the left of the ornamental frame, an alteration protector is often used—one to the left of the numerals to
                  protect that side and sometimes one to the right of the word DOLLARS so an amount in cents cannot be added. These alteration protector marks
                  are usually a handwritten "#" (the symbol for number or pound weight) or a dash or one or more crosses or curves. The $ sign usage in this
                  context was minimal because DOLLARS was already printed on the form (<ref target="fig-21">figs. 22-24</ref>).</p>

               <p>Continuing into the first decade of the nineteenth century, the <placeName>United States</placeName> obligations authorized by the various
                  Acts of Congress were in similar form but for convenience, pursuant to certain authorizations, specific denominations were printed on the
                  obligation document and not filled in by hand. In such case the amount and the word DOLLARS were printed in typeset letters, but in the lower
                  left corner area, typeset numerals were used, DOLLARS spelled out in typeset letters, and a typeset alteration protector printed in front of
                  the numerals.</p>
               <p>In an August 27, 1800 obligation for "1000 Dollars," the alteration protector in the lower left corner is a typeset "§" or section sign (<ref target="fig-22">fig. 25</ref>).</p>

               <p>In a January 11, 1805 obligation for "400 Dollars," the protector consists of two identical typeset ornaments, each with a wormlike form
                  slanting down to the left and an interrupted diagonal line slanting down to the right (<ref target="fig-23">fig. 26</ref>; this ornament

               <p>In a May 13, 1806 obligation for "400 Dollars," the alteration protector consists of three typeset 8 pointed star-like ornaments as points of
                  a triangle known in printing as an asterism (<ref target="fig-24">fig. 27</ref>).</p>

               <p>For the 1813 <persName>U.S</persName>. Loan, the lower left corner of the obligation has the word DOLLARS in typeset letters moved to the
                  left of the space to be filled in by handwritten numerals. By this action the right end of the numerals required alteration protection by
                  writing in some mark by hand (<ref target="fig-25">fig. 28</ref>).</p>

               <p>This practice continued for more than another decade even though check writing, invoicing, accounting records and private obligations had
                  solved this alteration problem with a $ sign to the left and a fraction line or punctuation to the right of the written dollar numerals.</p>
               <p>The various typeset styles and ornament placements on <persName>U.S</persName>. fiscal obligations, at a time when type for the $ sign
                  was readily available beginning in 1799, indicates that there was a reluctance to accept the $ sign on formal or official documents. It was
                  not until <persName>U.S</persName>. obligations were privately designed and printed by <persName>Rawdon, Wright &amp;
                     Hatch</persName> from fully engraved plates under the Act of October 12, 1837, that the use of the printed $ sign on some of the formal U. S.
                  obligations was commenced and continued at convenience.</p>
               <p>At the commencement of the Civil War, in addition to issuing bonds, the Union authorized and issued interest bearing, circulating notes of
                  appropriate size and denomination. A design submitted for the back of an 1861 Interest Bearing Note of 500 dollars contained a warning that
                  the fine for counterfeiting was "$1000" in addition to confinement. In due course the Union issued various types of noninterest bearing paper
                  money for circulation and when a counterfeit warning was placed on some National Bank Notes in 1863, the $ sign was similarly applied.
                  Beginning in 1869, many Legal Tender or <placeName>United States</placeName> Notes had a $ sign in the counterfeit warning.</p>
               <p>The use of the $ sign on the back of the Compound Interest Notes of 1863, etc., was used as part of the total amount of interest payable. The
                  $ sign then spread to coupons as a space saver. The first instance of a $ sign as a major element in the design of circulating Federal
                  currency is on some of the Coin Notes of the Series of 1890 and 1891.</p>
               <p>However a decorative emblem of a capital S superimposed on the right upright of a capital U was extensively used on federally authorized paper
                  money beginning in the Civil War period and continuing into the twentieth century. That emblem does not resemble a $ sign but if its S portion
                  had been centered over both uprights of the U it would have appeared similar. The emblem is merely an artistic "U S" insignia. It is found 15
                  times on the 1875 series $20 <persName>U.S</persName>. Note and a lesser number of times on other denominations. It is used either on the
                  face or back or both. It is found on various issues and denominations of Interest Bearing Treasury Notes, Compound Interest Notes, Legal
                  Tender or <persName>U.S</persName>. Notes, Coin Notes, Silver Certificates, Gold Certificates, and National Bank Notes. It seems to have
                  developed independently as a design element without any influence from the prior existence of the conventional $ sign.</p>

               <p>There was a slow introduction of the conventional $ sign in books, possibly fearing a hesitant public acceptance. The first edition (1801) of
                     <hi rend="italic">The Scholar's Arithmetic or Federal Accountant</hi>, devoted pages 87 through 97 to explanations and calculations

                  of that book published in 1805 in <persName>Leominister, Massachusetts</persName>, and thereafter until the final edition in 1833, the
                  conventional $ sign was used extensively, particularly when amounts were tabulated or totalled. In 1808, other American reckoners, almanacs,
                  instructional books and manuals on arithmetic, accounting and business calculations also began to use the $ sign, always trailing by several
                  years the use of the printed $ sign in newspapers and other more informal documents.<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref>

               <p>The use of the $ sign on printed checks slowly developed as people recognized the advantage of using the $ sign as an alteration pro- <pb n="39"/> tector on the left side of a number. In the late eighteenth century, there was no such protection and either Doll, Dolls or
                  Dollars were customarily printed on checks in a position so that numerals could be written in on the left and a fraction bar printed on the

               <p>On the early nineteenth century checks, the word "Dollars" was often printed at the left end so that the written numerals could be written in

               <p>Sometimes a fraction bar with "100" underneath it was printed followed by "Dollars" in print so that the numerals for dollars could be written
                  to the left and the numerals for cents written over the bar of the printed items. <ref target="fig-33">Fig. 36</ref> ilustrates a check where
                  a written $ sign is added as an alteration protector. In similar fashion a printed $ sign was added to the left of the space for the numerals
                     (<ref target="fig-34">fig. 37</ref>).</p>

               <p>These were the early forms of checks which gave rise to the need to use the $ sign in expressing a monetary amount in a concise and protective

               <p>When Portuguese inflation resulted in the circulation of high denomination bank notes beginning in 1797, that issue of paper money contained a
                  $ as a symbol. In order to make the denominations of the engraved currency easier for the public to read, the $ was placed between the
                  numerals constituting thousands and the numerals less than one thousand. For example 10,000 reis was printed as 10$000 rs and 2,400 reis was
                  printed as 2$400 reis (<ref target="fig-35">figs. 38</ref>-<ref target="fig-36">39</ref>). This practice was continued on some Portuguese and
                  Brazilian paper money during the nineteenth century when denominations were in multiples of milreis (1000 reis).</p>

               <p>When in the eighth century Arabs moved westward across <persName>North Africa</persName> into the <persName>Iberian
                     peninsula</persName>, they introduced their use of a zero in numbering. This was a symbol which Roman numerals did not include. This zero was
                  called sifir in Arabic and cifra in Spanish and Portuguese. It was a representation of a mathematical concept or a code just as were other
                  Arabic and Roman symbols for numbers and gave rise to the English word "cipher" which is understood as meaning number as well as code.</p>

               <p>When Roman numerals were used to write a large number there often was a signal to represent thousand and this was a very wide M (the Roman
                  letter representing 1000) or a convex arc which was written over the top of the Roman letter symbols which denoted the number of thousands
                     (<ref target="fig-37">fig. 40</ref>). The Arabs simplified this indicator <pb n="42"/> for writing both Roman and Arabic numbers by placing
                  a long armed U between the symbols or numerals for one or more thousands and those for less than one thousand (<ref target="fig-38">figs.
                     41</ref>-<ref target="fig-39">42</ref>). This long armed U was stylistically written with flourishes so that by the beginning of the
                  eighteenth century in <persName>Portugal</persName>, it appeared as a U with arms curving inward, over which a crossbar was sometimes
                  added to distinguish it as a symbol (<ref target="fig-40">fig. 43</ref>).</p>

               <p>As its convenience further developed, the rounded U was improved by being divided into three parts by inscribing two close parallel lines
                  across it running from upper right to lower left. Thus the rounded U was divided into three sections, one representing each of the three
                  numerals which were necessary to reach the thousand plateau (<ref target="fig-41">fig. 44</ref>).</p>
               <p>This aggrandizement or enlargement of the cifra or symbol for thousand was then referred to in Portuguese as cifrão (phonetically cifron) in
                  accordance with the common Portuguese practice to add a suffix in this manner to aggrandize the expression. After the middle of the eighteenth
                  century, some stylistic modifications to the rounded portion of the cifrão took place so that it appeared more like an S than a modified U.
                  The two parallel lines in the cifrão were changcd to a more nearly upright position. No items printed in Portuguese have been located which
                  bear the cifrão $ symbol prior to the year 1797 when the $ symbol was engraved into the plates for printing Portuguese bank notes previously
                  described.</p>
               <p>The Portuguese kept the cifrão in common usage as a symbol for thousand throughout the nineteenth century in both <persName>Portugal</persName> and <persName>Brazil</persName>, but occasionally the style changed when the S portion sometimes became topless,
                  being a throw back to its origin as a rounded U (<ref target="fig-42">figs. 45</ref>-<ref target="fig-44">47</ref>).</p>

               <p>An abrupt change in the meaning of the Portuguese $ symbol or cifrão occurred when a Portuguese decree of May 22, 1911, and the law of June
                  21, 1913, provided that the $ or cifrão no longer represented 1000 in monetary matters but thereafter was to represent a newly revived
                  monetary unit, the Escudo. The Escudo was divided into 100 centavos. The newly defined $ symbol was placed between the number of Escudos and
                  the number of centavos for monetary convenience, with the numerals to the left of the symbol representing Escudos and two numerals to the
                  right representing the number of centavos. The new $ was also usable on the left end of the numbers and a punctuation mark or space used as a
                  separator from centavos. These uses are evident on some twentieth century issues of Portuguese paper money (<ref target="fig-45">figs.
                     48</ref>-<ref target="fig-46">49</ref>).</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Thus the Portuguese cifrão or $ symbol seems to have developed quite independently and for its entire lifetime has had an entirely separate
                  meaning and interpretation from that of the conventional $ sign for dollar. No evidence has as yet come to our attention by which the
                  Portuguese cifrão $ symbol influenced the conventional $ sign for dollar or vice versa.</p>

            <p>Striking the first <placeName>United States</placeName> coins was not a simple matter. Some members of the Continental Congress wanted the
               mark, some the eagle, and some the dollar to be our unit. In 1792 the Senate passed a bill authorizing the first coinage, and stated that <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</persName> should be depicted on the obverse, but the House refused to go along. When the
               eagle was mentioned for the reverse, one legislator commented that the eagle was the king of birds, and that we should reject anything regal.
               Another said, facetiously, that he agreed, and recommended using the goose, a very plebeian bird. He said that the gosling could be used on the
               minor coinage.</p>
            <p>Congress finally passed the coinage bill with the weight of the dollar set at 4l6 grains of .8924 silver. Assayer <persName>Albion
                  Cox</persName> found the fineness standard difficult to use. He told Director <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> that .8924 fine silver would
               turn black with use, whereas .900 would not. <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> accepted the argument, and the dollar contained 374.4 grains
               of fine silver instead of the 371.25 mandated by Congress.</p>
            <p>On October 15, 1794, the first dollars were struck. The coining press was not designed for such a large coin, and the dies were not parallel.
               Many of the coins were weak on the lower obverse and corresponding reverse.</p>
            <p>The first dollars made in 1794 and 1795 had flowing hair obverses. The reverses contained a wreath with a large eagle on it, the wings protruding
               through the wreath. Approximately 162,000 of this type were produced.</p>
            <p>The next type was the draped, or fillet bust obverse with the small eagle reverse. While the other four denominations of the variety were struck
               only in 1796 and 1797, dollars were made in 1795, 1796, 1797 and 1798.</p>
            <p>About 145,000 dollars were struck, but only about 112,000 of the other four denominations. While all of the flowing hair type had 15 star
               obverses (one for each state), the addition of Tennessee as our sixteenth state in 1796 posed a problem. It was almost impossible to cram 16
               stars into the available space. Starting production with 8 stars on the left side and 7 on the right, the combination of 9 left and 7 right was
               used, without much success. Then, for some reason, one die was made with 10 stars on the left and 6 on the right, with even less luck. It was
               finally decided that only 13 stars would be used, and this standard remained for the life of the bust dollars.</p>
            <p>There were also some changes in the reverse dies. On the large eagle varieties, some had 2 leaves and some 3 leaves under the right wing. On some
               small eagle reverses, small letters were used while <pb n="53"/> large letters were used on others. The combinations of obverse and reverse die
               changes result in two types of flowing hair dollars, and six types of fillet bust, small eagle varieties.</p>
            <p>
               <ref target="fig-48">Figure 1</ref> depicts an odd dollar, B6.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> Both sides are badly scratched, especially the
               obverse. The reverse die was heavily cracked, and one side of the coin is on a higher plane than the other. This is the only known example of the
               reverse, although there is a rumor that a second one exists. It is thought that the die broke on a very earlv strike.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-48">

            </figure>
            <p>I used this coin in a grading exercise for a youth coin class. I asked the students to grade the left side of the reverse, then the right. How
               can one coin have two such different grades? One of the students asked, <persName>"Mr. Reiver</persName>, do you think that the reverse die
               was broken on the first or second strike? If so, might the minter have thought that this broken die was too bad to be acceptable, that the die
               could not be used. Might he have cancelled the coin or coins, and kept one for a souvenir?" I think that it is entirely possible.</p>
            <p>Production settled down in 1798, when the reverse was changed to the heraldic eagle with 13 stars. Approximately 1,154,000 were produced through
               1803. Mint records show that 19,570 dollars were struck in 1804 and 321 in 1805. It is believed that the 1804 dollars all were dated 1803, and
               the 1805 coins were some that had been sent to the mint as bullion to be struck, then returned when dollars were cancelled.</p>
            <p>Of the 90 varieties produced, only three varied from the standard. Two used the same reverse die with 15 stars, and one used an obverse die with
               8 stars on the right and 5 on the left. Both of these dies were made in error.</p>
            <p>It seems that not much silver bullion was brought to the mint to be turned into coins. Although the suppliers wanted dollars, it appears that the
               powers wanted to keep more people supplied with coins, and produced smaller denominations, particularly half dollars.</p>

            <p>Another factor was that many of the dollars were sent out of the country, and officials preferred that the coins remain home, so no dollars were
               struck after 1803. A counterfeit 1805 was produced and soon became the subject of a heated argument, the owner believing it to be real.</p>
            <p>On the subject of counterfeits, there are many. Some are cast in the Orient, mainly 1804 dollars with the AMERICAI reverse. Some castings are
               beautifully made like the 1794 counterfeit which fooled many collectors (<ref target="fig-49">fig. 2</ref>). In fact, it has ANACS papers to
               prove that it is authentic. There was a 1799 struck counterfeit being sold a few years ago. It was so well done that the only way to tell that it
               was not real was that the edge was not so nicely done.</p>

            <p>The 1805 dollar is not the only one which we now think does not exist. Some nine varieties have been dropped by some collectors over the years. A
               typical case is the 12 star variety of 1798. Many years ago a <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> article described a new variety of 1798 dollar,
               having only 12 stars on the obverse.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> Of course I started looking for one. When I found one, it had only 11 stars, so
               I continued looking. I checked the coin against all of the 1798 varieties, and found that it was B8, a common variety. Continued searching turned
               up one with 9 stars, one with 10, and finally, one with 12 stars (<ref target="#fig-50">fig. 3a-d</ref>).</p>
            <p>This led to a search for other varieties with progressive damage to the dies. <ref target="#fig-51">Figures 4a</ref> and <ref target="#fig-52">4b</ref> picture the results of our latest search, die states of 1798 B28. Many of the other dies lend themselves to die state studies.</p>

            <p>
               <persName>K.P. Austin</persName>, who bought the entire <persName>Bolender</persName> collection, offered me an unlisted 1795 variety,
               for a very high price. I checked it, and decided that it was merely a die state. I took color slides to prove my point, and drove to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> to argue with <persName>Frank Stirling</persName>, a true dollar specialist,
               who had told me that the new variety was valid. I set up the projector and started to show slides. When <persName>Frank</persName> saw what
               I was about, he said, "Shucks, Jules, I was just pulling your leg. <persName>Emanuel Taylor</persName> told me that it was a die state in
               1926."</p>
            <p>Also of interest to collectors are error coins. There are many examples which have been struck two or more times. You will hear talks on
               counterstamped and engraved dollars, and plugged centers. Another category is engraver's errors. <ref target="fig-53">Figure 5</ref> depicts one
               where the date was punched in as 1195, instead of 1795. On the scarce 1797 B2 variety, a star was punched far below the star left of L on the
               obverse. On the 1795 B13 the B in LIBERTY was punched in <pb n="56"/> twice. The diesinker then punched an E over the second B. My favorite one
               is the reverse die used on 1799 B3 and B4. The engraver mistakenly punched 15 stars on the reverse, realized his mistake, and tried to pull the
               two end clouds down to cover two of the stars (<ref target="fig-54">fig. 6</ref>).</p>

            <p>Several years ago I became intrigued by some unusual silver dollars that I had seen (<ref target="#fig-55">fig. 1</ref>). They were all dated
               1795, and had a curious circular ring or seam showing at the center on each side. The imperfection looked like a carefully repaired hole that had
               been plugged with silver and then disguised to hide the work. There had to be a reason for so many coins showing the same peculiarity, so I
               resolved to find the answer.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-55">
               <graphic url="COAC9_058.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>After examining several of these coins I found that the flaw was not simply a repair, but in fact was something that had been done at the Mint
               before the coins were struck. Evidence of this was clear because there could be no doubt that the design impressed from the dies was on top of
               the spot in question. There had been no tooling or other repair to the area after the coins had been struck.</p>
            <p>The unusual dollars with this curious feature are all dated 1795. They look just like other dollars of the period except for a telltale circle
               which can be seen at the center on each side. The detail can best be described as a silver plug which has been imbedded in the planchet before
               normal striking. In some cases only a seam, or discoloration at the coin's center, shows on one or both sides.</p>
            <p>Just why plugs were added to these coins is a mystery. Most of the silver dollars of 1795 do not have a plug, and no dollars of any other date
               have this same feature. Indeed, as far as I know, no other coin denomination in the regular United States series was officially altered with a
               plug of any kind.</p>
            <p>There is, however, precedent for a comparable plug. A similar circumstance occurred with the 1792 "silver center" pattern pieces. Those coins
               were made with a silver dowel inserted in the center of a copper planchet prior to striking. The reason for that experiment was to raise the
               intrinsic value of the copper to full face value. No such effort would have been necessary in the case of the 1795 <pb n="59"/> dollars because
               the entire coin was made of silver and adding a plug would not change the value in any way.</p>
            <p>It is curious that no information has ever before been published about these unusual coins. Perhaps they were simply not noticed in the past. A
               few numismatists have known about them for a decade, but no one has attempted to explain the strange alteration. It is reasonable to believe that
               many specimens have been overlooked because of the subtle difference in their appearance. Perhaps that will change now that they have been
               separately catalogued in print.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The number of pieces originally produced at the Mint with these plugs can be estimated only roughly. I believe it must have been substantial
               based on the availability of surviving specimens and the number of die combinations involved in making the coins. In searching for specimens in
               dealers' stocks, I was able to identify a dozen pieces in a six-month period. Apparently they are still relatively prevalent, and the original
               mintage must have been quite extensive.</p>
            <p>All of the 1795 plugged dollars seen so far are of the Flowing Hair type. No 1795 Draped Bust pieces with this feature have been noted. The
               varieties examined are <persName>Bolender</persName> number 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> In every case many more "normal"
               specimens are known of each of these varieties. Continued search has failed to turn up any additional varieties, but many more of the plugged
               coins have been reported since publication of information about them.</p>
            <p>In each case, the plugs were inserted before the coins were struck. The insert has been impacted by dies, and carries impressions of the obverse
               and reverse designs. The plugs average about 8 mm in diameter and usually are evident on both sides of the coin. They are always located at the
               approximate center of the specimen.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Q. David Bowers</persName> suggests that the striking sequence of 1795 dollars indicates that the known varieties of plugged coins
               were made early in the series. According to his research, they must have been made near late summer of 1795.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> The
               entire production apparently took place around the middle of the year, and before any of the Draped Bust dollars were coined. The dollars of 1794
               have been so carefully studied it seems improbable that any of them were plugged and have gone unnoticed. It also seems likely that no plugged
               pieces were made later than 1795.</p>
            <p>A student of early coinage, <persName>Roger Burdette</persName>, also puzzled over the strange plugged dollars for some time and concluded
               that the insert was done at the Mint to adjust either the weight, or the silver content of the planchet. We found that each of us had the same
               suspicion, and concluded that the most reasonable premise was that <pb n="60"/> the plug was intended to correct an error in the fineness of the
               metal. The question was, why would only some of the 1795 dollars show this unique form of planchet adjustment, when no other coin in the entire
                  <persName>U.S</persName>. series has been so treated.</p>
            <p>There was good reason to suspect that planchets for the 1795 dollars needed to be adjusted to bring them to the correct fineness for silver as
               authorized by Congress. It is a matter of record that some of the early <placeName>United States</placeName> coins were not made correctly.
               The oversight occurred when Mint Director David <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> took it upon himself to allow coins to be made of an
               illegal standard to reconcile the strange .89243 thousandths fineness mandated by Congress. He reasoned that the standard was flawed in
               specifying a complicated fineness of l485/l664th, at a time when their technology did not permit accurate verification.</p>
            <p>It seemed likely that Director <persName>Rittenhouse</persName>, who sought to change the standard, was encouraged by the supporting report
               of a committee of the House. Relying on his more practical approach, he decided to use an alloy of .900 fine silver. This produced a coin with
               374.75 grains of silver and a total weight of 416.39 grains. Both <persName corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</persName> and <persName>Alexander Hamilton</persName> thought this an acceptable solution, and <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> produced many dollars
               during 1795 using the unauthorized alloy.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, his alteration had the effect of adding a small amount to the value of the silver in each coin; and eventually <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> was caught by a depositor of bullion who argued that he did not receive the full number of dollars for the amount of
               silver he had turned over to the Mint. <persName>John Vaughn</persName>, who noticed this discrepancy, charged that by adding about 3.5
               grains of extra silver to each dollar, the Mint had cheated him out of $2,620. He demanded reimbursement from Congress, and his claim was
               approved in February of 1800.</p>
            <p>This scenario speaks well for the possibility of the strange plugged dollars being part of a maneuver by <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> to
               correct the fineness of planchets that had been prepared to the illegal standard. As tempting as this conclusion is to ponder, it is flawed, and
               does not seem to be the actual reason for the alteration. The use of multiple dies to strike the plugged pieces indicates a practice that went on
               over a period of time, and would negate the theory of a wholesale repair of sub-standard planchets.</p>
            <p>A simpler and more plausible explanation is that the plug was used to adjust the weight of these coins. Planchet preparation in those days was
               costly and time consuming. Any that were too heavy could be filed to remove excess metal, but underweight planchets had to <pb n="61"/> be melted
               and remade. Many examples of early <persName>U.S</persName>. coins are known showing adjustment marks made by filing the planchets before
               striking. Until now, nothing has been known about how underweight planchets might have been corrected.</p>
            <p>The answer seems to be that the during mid-1795 an experiment was tried in the mint to salvage lightweight planchets by inserting a dowel, or
               plug, in the center of the piece and then striking it with normal dies. There would be no need to drill a hole, or remove any metal. A simple
               piercing with a sharp instrument would leave an opening where a pin or dowel could be inserted. The effect after striking would be to round over
               the exposed tips on each side of the coin, much like the ends of rivet used in building construction.</p>
            <p>Further proof of this hypothesis was derived from tests I conducted on several pieces to ascertain the metal content of both the coin and plug.
               If plugs were added to adjust the fineness, they would be of lower fineness than the coin itself, which, according to <persName>Rittenhouse</persName>, exceeded the fineness specified by law. If, on the other hand, the plugs were added to adjust the weight, their fineness
               would be similar to the rest of the coin.</p>
            <p>In most cases where tests were made, spectrographic X-ray analysis showed that both the plug and the coin were made of the same alloy. With one
               specimen, the plug was of higher fineness; a second specimen contained a plug of lower fineness. For others there was little or no
               difference.</p>
            <p>Although these tests do not establish the exact nature and reason for the plugs being inserted into these coins, it seems safe to conclude that
               the plugs were added to bring the underweight planchets up to standard. Why this practice involved only silver dollar blanks, and only Flowing
               Hair pieces of 1795 is puzzling. One possibility is that it was part of an effort to produce a large quantity of dollar blanks to be stored and
               ready for production when a new more powerful coinage press would be ready for operation.</p>
            <p>On May 6, 1795, that press was put in use, and thousands of dollars were delivered shortly thereafter. Surely some or all of them were made from
               the old stockpile of planchets, which could have included an indiscriminate number of blanks that had been adjusted by plugging. Drawing
               planchets from such a storehouse would account for the arbitrary use of plugged blanks mixed with normal planchets, and they would have been used
               in the production of coins from several die combinations.</p>
            <p>Further evidence of this extraordinary method of weight adjustment has been discovered by <persName>Horace P. Flatt</persName> in a
               documented account of how coins were produced in <persName>Lima</persName>, <persName>Peru</persName>, about the same time.<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref> The pertinent part reads as follows: <pb n="62"/>
               <q>...The next process is the weighing; the person who performs this has a little square box containing silver pins that are no longer than the
                  thickness of a dollar, and of different weights and sizes; the dollars are thrown one by one into the scales, but seldom any of them are too
                  heavy, when they are, they generally pass them without notice, but if any are too light a pin is thrown into the scale which brings it to the
                  standard weight.</q>
               <q>The dollar is then put under a screw which has a pointed instrument in the end of it, which is screwed down and pierces a hole in the dollar
                  sufficiently large to receive the pin; then it is placed under another screw with a smooth end, which completely fastens the pin in the coin;
                  they are then passed into another room where they are coined.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This description seems to fit exactly the manufacturing process necessary to produce the effect seen on these 1795 dollars. It would be an
               effective and accurate method of adding to the weight of the planchets. Once coined the corrected pieces would hardly be discernible. In fact one
               specimen recently examined by Bowers and still in choice Uncirculated condition, showed the plug clearly only on the obverse side.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> It seems likely that with wear, many of these repaired pieces would go undetected until toning or close scrutiny
               revealed a faint trace of something unnatural.</p>
            <p>Indeed, most of these curious pieces have gone unnoticed until recent times. Perhaps now that they are better known we will be able to learn more
               about them. Or perhaps additional coins of other denominations or dates will be found. It is a challenge well worth pursuing to help better
               understand the intriguing and little known history of minting practices in the early <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint.</p>

            <p>"Those of us who have wandered down the numismatic byroad that leads to the study of countermarks occasionally find ourselves far from the beaten
               path, bogged down in a quagmire of uncertainty. Fanciful conjecture sometimes influences our attempts to decipher some obscure hieroglyphic
               impressed upon a coin by an individual in some perilous time past."<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>So wrote <persName>Edward Fisher</persName> in a recent article dealing with nineteenth century <persName>Mexican</persName>
               countermarks; and it somewhat applies here. About two years ago, I saw a few countermarks on early dollars, and made a note of them. As a student
               of our early dollars, my interest had less to do with countermarks than with the usage of our early dollars. Several dozen countermarks have come
               to my attention since—and for some there is a history of sorts—but for the most part they pose questions to which answers are yet to be
               evident.</p>
            <p>As information accumulates one classifies. These four classifications of countermarks and overstrikes have been useful: a) personal pocket
               pieces; b) merchant advertising; c) to certify value; and d) to endorse local use.</p>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e4268" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi rend="bold">Personal Pocket Pieces</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Many of the countermarked early dollars bear initials. This difficult group probably comprises the personal pocket pieces.</p>
               <p>A 1799 dollar with initials FW and 1863 in script and a less fancy B and C is an example. Could it have been carried by a Union soldier? And
                  if it was ..., well, you can imagine the questions we might have; especially since by 1863, a 1799 dollar was a "keeper."</p>
               <p>Countermarked names provide better prospects for identification, but certainly not in every instance. <persName>W.B. Joy</persName> is
                  countermarked on a 1798 dollar. Who was <persName>W.B. Joy</persName>? M. Miner also appears on a 1798 dollar. As yet, no clue to an
                  identity. If these people were merchants or otherwise prominent, it is likely that they will eventually be identified because of the microfilm
                  availability of earlier newspapers and city directories.</p>
               <p>L.L. Squire on a 1795 dollar is probably the work of <persName>L. L. Squire</persName> and Sons, ship chandlers and rope makers on Front
                  Street in <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> (<ref target="fig-56">fig. 1</ref>). Besides rope and
                  candles the firm dealt in oils, paints, anchors, chain cables, and naval stores.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>C.C. Clark</persName> (<persName>Carlos C. Clark</persName>), appears on a 1799 and an 1802 dollar. <persName>Clark</persName>, a New England gunsmith, seems to have had a penchant for recording dates on early dollars, which could record significant
                  dates in his career. On the 1802 dollar there are three dates: 1842, 1864, 1879, and an engraved flower. <persName>Russell
                     Rulau</persName> conjectures that he began self-employment in <persName>Windsor</persName>, VT, as a gunsmith in 1842.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>

               <p>There are records that he was employed from 1846 to 1856 by percussion riflemakers <persName>Robbins</persName> and <persName>Lawrence</persName>. He moved to <persName>New Hampshire</persName> about 1863 and possibly the 1864 date on the coin refers to the
                  actual date of relocation. The 1879 date may indicate retirement. A 1799 dollar, apparently using the same or similar punches, bears his name
                  and the dates 1842 to 1879.</p>

                  <persName>Abram Brinsmaid</persName>, a <persName>Burlington</persName>, VT silversmith, was born in <persName>Great
                     Barrington</persName>, MA, in 1770, and died in <persName>Burlington</persName> in 1811. His firm and its successors, <persName>Brinsmaid</persName> and <persName>Hildreth</persName>, used his hallmark years after his death. The same hallmark is known on silverware
                  in addition to this double struck 1795 flowing hair dollar (<ref target="fig-57">fig. 2</ref>). This dollar <pb n="66"/> is prominently double
                  struck and it is a very rare die variety (<persName>Bolender</persName> 8) of which only a few are known. Since the mint delivered coins
                  in exchange for a corresponding weight of precious metal, possibly the production of this rare variety went to the <persName>Burlington</persName> area.</p>
               <p>An <persName>H.G. Stone</persName> hallmark on an 1803 dollar is attributed to <persName>Hubbard Stone</persName>, a <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> silversmith (<ref target="fig-58">fig. 3</ref>).</p>

               <p>"EB counterstamp, fodder for legends," is the lead line for a <hi rend="italic">Coin World</hi> article by <persName>William
                     Swoger</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> These are the doubloon and the <persName corresp="#viaf_49264990">George III</persName>
                  <persName>Guinea</persName>. They represent <persName>Ephraim Brasher's</persName> trade of certifying foreign gold coins for use
                  locally. The <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> goldsmith lived from 1744-1810 (and counted <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</persName> among his circle). Note that as initialed coins these fit a personal piece
                  category. As a known hallmark they fit the advertising category; and as assays they fit the certification for value and even the authorization
                  for local use categories. So much for any attempts at unambiguous classification.</p>
               <p>The fame of the EB countermark tempts some to attribute all of them to Brasher. <persName>Milfred Bolender</persName>, whose early dollar
                  book has been a valuable standard for many years (although it is now inadequate), attributes a 1799 dollar with an EB countermark to <persName>Brasher</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref>. But some point out that <persName>Brasher</persName> may have only countermarked gold coins. Gregory
                  Brunk, a foremost student of countermarks, asserts that not all the EB countermarks seen on coins belong to <persName>Brasher</persName>.
                  He suggests that this one in particular may belong to Ezekiel Burr, a Providence silversmith who died in 1846.<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref>

               <p>But, is it <persName>Ezekiel Burr</persName>? An authoritative volume by <persName>Belden</persName> on early American silver lists
                  and attributes EB hallmarks to various silversmiths.<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref> A bit of detective work probably can settle this.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>L. Bailey</persName> on a 1795 bust dollar has been attributed <persName>Lebbus Bailey</persName>, a <persName>Portland</persName>, ME gunsmith although <persName>Q. David Bowers</persName> thinks <persName>Loring Bailey</persName>, a llingham
                  (or Hull), <persName>MA silversmith</persName> is a better answer.<ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> His thought is prompted by the <persName>hallmark</persName>—it was more likely to be used by a silversmith than a gunsmith. The piece supports a conjecture that a coin
                  could be handy piece on which to try a new punch or puncher. It follows that writing off all EBs not on gold as not belonging to <persName>Brasher</persName> may be hasty.</p>

               <p>Finally, among the merchants, is the popular favorite, <persName>Houck's Panacea</persName>, which appears on a 1795 dollar in the SI and
                  on an 1883 half dollar in the ANS (<ref target="fig-59">fig. 4</ref>). An ad from an early <persName>Baltimore</persName> City Directory

               <p>The countermarking by silversmiths seems to be a practice of those in the northeast. I don't know of silversmiths south of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</placeName> (and most are from New England), who countermarked early dollars.</p>

               <p>Two other Scottish merchant countermarks are known. One belongs to <persName>John McLean</persName> on a 1799 dollar with inscribed value
                  5 shillings, 3 pence and the Scottish town of <persName>Paisley</persName>. The third such is countermarked "WG and Co" and 4 shillings,
                  9 pence.</p>
               <p>That these three merchant countermarks originated in <persName>Scotland</persName>, probably as a response to the severe British coin
                  shortage about that time, suggests that the officially counterstamped <persName corresp="#viaf_49264990">George III</persName> pieces
                  didn't reach the Scots in adequate quantities.</p>
               <p>In the last years of the eighteenth century and into the early 1800s, Britain experienced a severe shortage of circulating silver. The British
                  possessed sizable quantities of captured Spanish dollars and in an attempt to relieve the shortage, the king's head, used to mark silver, was
                  stamped on the head of the Spanish king, <persName>Charles IV</persName>, in March 1797. These were to be valued at 4 shillings and 6
                  pence each. However, before issue it was discovered that the bullion value was 4 and 8; a melt value of two pence higher than the intended
                  face value. Simple solution: to prevent melting, revalue them at 4 and 9. About 2 million were issued according to <persName corresp="numismatics_wood_howland">Howland Wood</persName>, an early student of the subject.<ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref> The issue was
                  immediately counterfeited which seems to give credence to a couplet of the time, "The Bank to make the Spanish dollar pass, stamped the head
                  of a fool on the head of an ass." The issue was demonetized in May 1804. It was then announced that <persName>Mr. Boulton</persName> of
                  Soho Mint fame had been engaged to produce a new dollar by obliterating the Spanish markings. A 5 shilling dollar, Bank of England, 1804, with
                  a <persName corresp="#viaf_49264990">George III</persName> obverse, and a Bank of Ireland 6 shilling dollar are in the ANS.</p>
               <p>The relevance of this to early dollars is that while the official Act applied only to the Spanish dollars, an oval <persName corresp="#viaf_49264990">George III</persName> countermark appears on a 1795 flowing hair dollar and octagonal impressions <pb n="70"/>
                  (intended to make counterfeiting more difficult) are known on 1798 and 1799 dollars. What is not known is whether these royal countermarks on
                     <persName>U.S</persName>. dollars are counterfeits, possibly intended to aid foreign coinage to pass more readily. An early Bangs
                  catalogue shows the royal countermark on a <persName>U.S</persName>. 1795 half dollar.<ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> Modern fakes are
                  uninteresting; but counterfeits of the time were, after all, circulating coinage.</p>

               <p>Much <persName>U.S</persName>. coinage circulated or was melted south of our border. Indeed, some believe that <persName>President Thomas Jefferson</persName> halted dollar production at least in part because of such melting.</p>
               <p>An "R.F. 1845" countermark has appeared on several dates including an 1800 dollar. It has been suggested that these could have been made for
                  the French Caribbean, say <persName>Guadeloupe</persName>; the R.F. standing for <persName>"République Français</persName>." <persName>Brunk</persName> is adamant that these are fantasy pieces that never saw the Caribbean.<ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It is possible that some of the support for Caribbean usage came from a French edict of 1802 for Guadeloupe that silver-dollar sized coins
                  have octagonal sections cut from the center and stamped "4E" (for the local currency) and "R.F." (<ref target="fig-62">fig. 7</ref>).<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref> Again, one can't say that this isn't a fantasy niece.</p>

               <p>A holed 1800 dollar with a "fleur de lis" counterstamp in the ANS (<ref target="fig-63">fig. 8</ref>) is housed in a box containing a note to
                  the effect that it was counterstamped by decree of the Governor General on November 27, 1884, and "the collectors of customs at <persName>Fajardo</persName>, <persName>Guayama</persName>, <persName>Ponce</persName>, <persName>Mayaguez</persName>, <persName>Arecibo</persName>, <persName>Vieques</persName> and <persName>San Juan</persName> counterstamped them to validate the

               <p>Further south in <persName>Uruguay</persName>, during a nine-year siege of <persName>Montevideo</persName> (1843-1852), pesos were
                  struck on our early dollars. Two examples are known. One is on a 1799 dollar recently sold by Superior Galleries<ref target="#CH5-n12">12</ref> and the other on a 1798 dollar in the ANS (<ref target="fig-64">fig. 9</ref>)</p>

               <p>Finally, I note two unusual 1794 dollars. The first is a 1794 dollar countermarked "F7" for <persName>Ferdinand VII</persName>,
                  apparently for use in the <persName>Philippines</persName>, then under Spanish rule.<ref target="#CH5-n13">13</ref> A note in a later
                  issue of <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> indicates that the coin was among other loot offered for sale in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> Its current whereabouts are unknown to me.</p>
               <p>The second, a 1795 dollar (<persName>Bolender</persName> 4), struck over a 1794 dollar belongs to <persName>Bowers</persName> and
                     <persName>Merena</persName> Galleries, Inc. The obverse clearly shows the outline of the eagle, wreath and parts of United. The
                  reverse shows some profile and back of Liberty's head. The coin was discovered by <persName>Breen</persName> who speculated on its
                     origins.<ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref> I have some recollection that he once entertained the idea that the mint may have struck a round
                  number of 1794 dollars, say 2,000 pieces. The reported mintage of 1,758 pieces, nearly none of high quality, may be all that were judged even
                  marginally useful as coinage. This piece, struck so weakly, may have kept it from the melting pot to await a proper coin press the next
                  year.</p>

               <p>The <persName>Morgan</persName> silver dollar, originally known as the <persName>Bland</persName> silver dollar after its sponsor in
                  Congress, was designed by an Englishman, <persName corresp="#viaf_305856677">George T. Morgan</persName>.<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref>
                  The unusual set of circumstances which led to <persName>Morgan</persName>, rather than having the dollar designed in the normal procedure
                  by the then mint chief engraver, William Barber, or his assistants, can partially be explained in the letters between Linder-man and
                  Fremantle, the Deputy Director of the Royal Mint in <persName>London</persName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Dr. Henry Richard Linderman</persName>, Director of the Mint, was responsible for this change in the procedure for the
                  designing of <persName>U.S</persName>. coins. In 1876, <persName>Linderman</persName> wanted to change the silver coinage designs
                  and felt that additional engravers were needed. On June 13, 1876, he sent a letter to <persName>C.W. Fremantle</persName>, Deputy Master,
                  Royal Mint, <persName>London</persName>, asking Fremantle "to find a first class die-sinker who would be willing to take the position of
                  assistant engraver at the Mint at <persName>Philadelphia</persName>."</p>
               <p>Further in the letter, <persName>Linderman</persName> went on to say that (and this is vital to the issue): <q>The engraving of coinage
                     and medal dies has not been brought to much perfection in this country. In England it appears to have reached a standard equal, if not
                     superior, to that of any other country.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Fremantle</persName> replied to <persName>Linderman</persName> in a letter of July 31, 1876: <q>My inquiries as to an
                     Assistant Engraver lead me very strongly to recommend for the post <persName>Mr. George Morgan</persName>, age 30, who has made
                     himself a considerable name, but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Fremantle</persName> further noted in this letter: <q>I have lost no time in taking steps to obtain for you designs in this
                     country for the head of "Liberty" to be put upon your silver coin...I put myself in communication with Messrs. <persName>J.S. and
                        A.B. Wyon</persName>, <persName>Mr. Leonard Wyon</persName> (Engravers of the Mint)....</q>
               </p>
               <p>A further letter on September 19, 1876 from <persName>Fremantle</persName> to <persName>Linderman</persName> mentioned sending:
                     <q>Those designs in plaster of the head of Liberty for the obverse of your silver coinage...you will have already received the designs sent
                     by Messrs. <persName>J.S. and A.B. Wyon</persName>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this letter it is evident that <persName>Linderman</persName> was at that time obtaining sample LIBERTY HEAD designs for use on
                     <persName>U.S</persName>. coins from <pb n="75"/> the Mint in <persName>England</persName>. It may also indicate that <persName>Linderman</persName> was not entirely satisfied with <persName>Barber's</persName> work and might have influenced him later
                  in his choice of designers for the new silver dollar proposed under the <persName>Bland-Allison</persName> Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Morgan</persName> agreed to work at the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> Mint for a trial sixmonth appointment reporting
                  directly to <persName>Linderman</persName>, followed by a longer period if things worked out.<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref>
                  <persName>Morgan</persName> was 31 when he left <persName>Liverpool</persName>, <persName>England</persName>, on September 27,
                  1876, on the steamship <hi rend="italic">

                  <ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref> and arrived in <persName>Philadelphia</persName> on October 9, 1876. He served at the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> Mint as an Assistant Engraver under <persName>William Barber</persName>, later serving in the same capacity under
                     <persName>William Barber's</persName> son until 1917, when he was appointed chief engraver. <persName>Morgan</persName> held this
                  office until his death on January 4, 1925, at the age of 79.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Morgan</persName> did not begin work on the silver dollar until a year after he arrived at the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> Mint. His first year's work, however, laid the foundation for the design of the silver dollar, since a number of
                  pattern dies were made with devices similar to that of the silver dollar. His first designs were for pattern half dollar pieces.</p>
               <p>After arriving in the <placeName>United States</placeName>
                  <persName>Morgan</persName> stayed at <persName>Mrs. Eckfeldt's</persName> boarding house at l6l4 Mount Vernon Street in <persName>Philadelphia</persName>.<ref target="#CH6-n6">6</ref> He did his initial modeling work there since at the Mint, according to <persName>Barber</persName>, there was not sufficient space. In an August 16, 1878 letter from <persName>Pollock</persName>,
                  Superintendent of the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> Mint to <persName>Linderman</persName>, <persName>Barber</persName>
                  mentioned that: <q>Space and Light in our Engraver's office are limited. I would be at a loss to know where to put Mr. <persName>Morgan</persName> that he could work to advantage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>William T. Barber</persName>, Chief Engraver, and his assistant and son, <persName corresp="#viaf_24873594">Charles E.
                     Barber</persName>, were probably not very cooperative with <persName>George Morgan</persName> since he was an outsider who had the special
                  privilege of reporting directly to Dr. <persName>Linderman</persName>. Thus, <persName>Morgan</persName> was forced not only to
                  develop his designs in the less than ideal place of his residence but also to endure the hostile atmosphere of the Mint Engraving
                  Department.</p>
               <p>On November 1, 1876, <persName>Morgan</persName> took his first model of a reverse eagle to the Mint for reduction. During November and
                  December 1876, <persName>Morgan</persName> presented additional models of the reverse eagle and obverse Liberty head for the half dollar.
                  In <persName>Morgan's</persName> letter of January 8, 1877, to <persName>Linderman</persName>, he forwarded wax impressions of three
                  dies to <persName>Linderman</persName> for his criticism. The letter stated: <pb n="76"/>
                  <q>No. 1 An impression from a wax mold taken from the working hub...and also shows the uneven surfaces where I have cut down the ground and
                     round the body of the eagle....</q>
               </p>
               <p>(Apparently there is no pattern available showing that eagle design.) <q>No. 2: is the same design with a different treatment of the wings - I
                     have yet another in hand where I make the feathers of the wings as large as No. 1, but to radiate from a center as in No. 2.</q>
               </p>
               <p>(These eagles are shown in <persName>Judd</persName> Patterns 1514 and 1516, showing an eagle with out-stretched but stubby wings and
                  encircled with a ring of pearls.)<ref target="#CH6-n7">7</ref>
                  <q>In No. 3 you will notice that the outline of the face is too bold. I have the profile eagle so far advanced that I hope to be able to send
                     you an impression this day week. The other head is being electroplated previous to reduction by the machine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>(No. 3 impression mentioned in <persName>Morgan's</persName> letter was the obverse Liberty head shown in <persName>Judd</persName>
                  1514 and 1516 similar to that used on the <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar but encircled with a ring of pearls. The profile eagle also
                  is encircled with a ring of pearls that was ready a week later and is shown in <persName>Judd</persName> 1512.) Specimen coins from these
                  dies were struck and forwarded to <persName>Linderman</persName> early in February 1877.</p>
               <p>These first half dollar specimens all had the same Liberty head design on the obverse with identical other design features of stars, ring of
                  pearls and denticles. The reverse had three different eagles with a large scroll beneath the eagle that was the same except for size. All have
                  the same ring of pearls of 121 dots surrounding the center designs on both sides and all have the same outer ring of 120 small denticles on
                  both sides. So there are common design elements in all three specimens. <persName>Morgan</persName> seemed to prefer working with three
                  design combinations as this number repeats time and again throughout his design refinement work.</p>
               <p>These original designs included the Liberty heads, eagles and wreathes but not the peripheral lettering, stars and dates. The dies and hubs
                  were destroyed at the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> mint on May 25, 1910. Clearly, many different dies and hubs of Liberty heads,
                  eagles and wreaths were prepared by <persName>Morgan</persName> and <persName>William Barber</persName> during the 1876-78 time
                  period.</p>
               <p>Although the dies and hubs made by <persName>Morgan</persName> were all destroyed in 1910, the <persName>Philadelphia</persName>
                  Mint still has a number of Galvanos of <persName>Morgan</persName> designs. These include an eagle clutching a scroll, olive branch and
                  arrows similar to <persName>Judd</persName> 1516, an eagle with outstretc- <pb n="77"/> hed wing similar to the $10 gold pattern and
                  initial dollar pattern, and the $ 10 gold obverse pattern.<ref target="#CH6-n8">8</ref> None of the Galvanos have lettering or stars around
                  the edges but show only the central design.</p>

                  superscriptions provided by the Act of January 18, 1837, Section 13. Six silver pattern dollars, bearing the designs of both <persName>Morgan</persName> and <persName>Barber</persName>, were forwarded to <persName>Linderman</persName> on December 5, 1877
                     [<ref target="fig-65">figs. 1</ref>-<ref target="fig-66">2</ref>).<ref target="#CH6-n9">9</ref> In a letter regarding these pattern
                  dollars, coiner <persName>O.C. Bosbyshell</persName> wrote to Superintendent <persName>Pollock</persName>: <q>I also send one of the
                     latter's (<persName>Barber's</persName>) designs in copper, in order to show clearly the work on his dies, as the silver are not as

               <p>This trouble with <persName>Barber's</persName> design was to have an important bearing on <persName>Linderman's</persName> eventual
                  choice of the design to be used. It should be noted that the old English letters used for the motto "In God We Trust" of <persName>Morgan's</persName> dollar was to make it the only <persName>U.S</persName>. coin to have old English letters in its composition and to
                  use both upper and lower case letters. It was also at that time the only <persName>U.S</persName>. coin to have an engraver's initial (M)
                  on both the obverse and reverse. <persName>Morgan</persName> experienced some problems with these pattern dies during the striking of

                  <persName>Morgan</persName> was also carrying out the first of many alterations of the silver dollar design. His letter to <persName>Linderman</persName> on January 30 details these alterations: <q>I have the working hubs for the silver dollar now finished. While
                     making these hubs I have taken care to reduce the relief in places where from the specimens already made I found it necessary. I have also
                     altered the eagle cutting away the wings from the legs and making a few other minor alterations...I understand that it was your desire that
                     I should see Col. Snowden I found his criticism very valuable and have adopted his suggestions almost entirely.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Colonel A. Loudon Snowden</persName> was, thus, the third person beside <persName>Morgan</persName> who influenced the
                  design of the silver dollar.<ref target="#CH6-n10">10</ref>
                  <persName>Linderman</persName> was concerned with the progress of these alterations and wrote <persName>Pollock</persName> January
                  29, February 7, and again on February 9, requesting that new specimens be forwarded to him when they were struck. In mid-February, <persName>Linderman</persName> made a visit to the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> mint and instructed <persName>Morgan</persName>: <q>To make some slight modifications in the reverse die engraved by him for the silver dollar.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Pete Bishal</persName> of Fall River, MA, has studied the denticles of the <persName>Morgan</persName> patterns and
                  regular issue dies and has pointed out that the original dollar patterns had 151 denticles on the obverse and reverse and that later pattern
                  reverses still had 151 denticles whereas later pattern reverses had 148 denticles.</p>
               <p>Other <persName>Morgan</persName> pattern dollars exist showing additional minor design refinements. These are changes suggested by <persName>Col. Snowden</persName> or requested by <persName>Linderman</persName> during January and February 1878. None quite match the
                  working dies that were eventually used in the regular coinage, however (<ref target="fig-67">fig. 3</ref>).</p>
               <p>In a letter to <persName>Pollock</persName> on February 21, 1878, <persName>Linderman</persName> inquired when the modifications by
                     <persName>Morgan</persName> would be completed so that a specimen could be forwarded to his office. He also added: <pb n="79"/>

                  <q>I have now to state for your information, that it is my intention, in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress becoming law, to
                     request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury of the dies prepared by <persName>Mr. Morgan</persName>.</q>
                  <q>It is the desire of the Secretary of the Treasury, as well as my own, that if the silver bill becomes law, the coinage of silver dollars
                     shall be commenced with the least practicable delay and carried to the full capacity of the mints for the execution of such coinage. It is
                     proper to add that the specimens struck from the dies prepared by Messrs. <persName>Morgan</persName> and <persName>Barber</persName> exhibit high skill as well as artistic taste and that there is little if any difference in their matters, but that since
                     a choice has to be made, I have selected the one having the lowest relief and requiring the lightest power to bring up the devices and
                     inscriptions. No mention, however, of my preference need be made until after the receipt of the specimens herein called for and
                     notification to you of its adoption.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, <persName>Linderman</persName> preferred the <persName>Morgan</persName> design over <persName>Barber's</persName> design
                  because of its lower design relief and desired the least delay in commencing the silver dollar coinage once the silver bill became law.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Morgan</persName> wrote to <persName>Linderman</persName> on February 22, that the dies with alterations would be ready in
                  a few days. He added some comments on the process of making these dies: <q>I made the alterations on the working hub, which was hardened on
                     Monday last...</q>
                  <q>These alterations make the working hub for the reverse useless as a regular working hub. I can make a specimen die from it, by cutting a
                     part of the work in the die.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="80"/>
               <p>It is clear from this letter and <persName>Morgan's</persName> letter of January 30, that alterations were made by cutting away the
                  working hub, thus reducing the size and relief of the design. He could have also added and strengthened details by cutting into the master
                  die. But for major changes, <persName>Morgan</persName> may have gone back to the design die or hub in order to make a new master die.
                  This may have happened for the reverse in February 1878, when the eagle's tail feathers were changed from seven to eight and the number of
                  olive leaves at the end of the branch was changed from three to nine. Production of the working dies was a slow process requiring from seven
                  to ten blows of the working hub at the rate of one blow a day. This fact will later prove important.</p>
               <p>Both of the reverse working hubs mentioned in the above letter were eventually used to make working dies that struck coins. As will be shown
                  later, this caused two minor design types of the 8 tail feather reverse. Soon afterward, <persName>Morgan</persName> visited <persName>Colonel Snowden</persName> for his opinion about the alterations.</p>
               <p>On February 28, the day that Congress passed the <persName>Bland -Allison</persName> silver dollar bill, <persName>Linderman</persName> wrote to <persName>Pollock</persName> ordering that the alterations be made to the working hub: <q>You will instruct
                     Mr. <persName>Morgan</persName> to finish his new working hubs, showing the alterations, as speedily as may be practicable, and that
                     immediately thereafter you will cause working dies to be made in sufficient quantity to commence striking pieces as soon as possible after
                     the bill may become a law...</q>
               </p>
               <p>On March 1, <persName>Linderman</persName> sent the following telegram to <persName>Pollock</persName>: <q>The specimen sent on
                     twenty fifth ulto <persName>Morgan</persName> modified die has been approved and adopted. Conform strictly to it in making new working
                     hubs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In a separate telegram the same day, he ordered: <q>Commence at once the preparation of silver dollar blanks to your full capacity and get the
                     working dies ready as soon as possible and commence striking. The full force of the Engravers Department will be applied to the preparation
                     of silver dollar dies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <persName>Philadelphia</persName> mint was, therefore, under great pressure to begin striking the new silver dollar.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>President Hayes</persName> and Secretary of the Treasury <persName>John Sherman</persName> had expressed to <persName>Linderman</persName> a desire to possess the first and second specimens, respectively, of the regular silver dollar coinage. In a
                  letter to <persName>Pollock</persName> on February 28, <persName>Linderman</persName> ordered: <q>You will instruct the coiner to
                     hand you the first piece <pb n="81"/> struck and the second piece, with a certificate of their being the first and second pieces struck and
                     transmit the certificates to me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So ended the initial design changes of the 1878 <persName>Morgan</persName> silver dollar but, unfortunately, not its troubles.</p>

               <p>The first coins were not struck until two weeks after the law was passed. The initial delivery of 303 coins was sent to <persName>Linderman</persName> on March 12. The first three coins went to <persName>President Hayes</persName>, Secretary of the Treasury <persName>John Sherman</persName>, and Mint Director <persName>Linderman</persName>. Contemporary newspaper accounts indicate that the
                  first dollar struck in the presses used for regular coinage of the new silver dollar was struck at 3:17 in the afternoon of March 11, 1878, at
                  the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> mint.</p>
               <p>The first dollar struck for regular issue, given to <persName>President Hayes</persName>, now resides in the <persName corresp="#viaf_64803399">Rutherford B. Hayes</persName> Museum at <persName>Fremont</persName>, <persName>Ohio</persName>, and is a

                  <p>5. A Rev.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>The first obverse design exists in I<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and I<hi rend="sup">2</hi> minor design types (<ref target="fig-68">fig. 4</ref>).
                  The I<hi rend="sup">1</hi> has an incused (recessed) designer's initial "M". The I<hi rend="sup">2</hi> has a raised (cameo) designer's
                  initial, "M", with two parallel vertical bars.</p>
               <p>There are two different A design reverse hubs with minor design differences (<ref target="fig-69">fig. 5</ref>). The A1 reverse has a raised
                  eagle's beak and the A2 reverse has a hooked eagle's beak.</p>
               <p>The high relief of the eight tail feather design shortened the life of the dies. In order to make the dies produce better, "efforts of
                  ingenuity" were used as <persName>Barber</persName> put it in a letter to <persName>Pollock</persName> on March 23: <pb n="82"/>
                  <q>I wish to report that by using what I might call "efforts of ingenuity" we have succeeded in making our dies produce "very well" this last
                     five days...</q>
               </p>
               <p>Unfortunately, the details of these irregular methods were not given in this letter. Examination of the die varieties of the first reverse
                  design (8 TF) indicates that some working dies were individually reengraved, adding two to three small feathers to both sides of the eagle's
                  legs just below the bottom of the wings. Apparently the basin-ing process polished part of the center designs off these dies and they had to
                  be individually touched up. There is also evidence that the A<hi rend="sup">2</hi> reverse hub was reimpressed into some A<hi rend="sup">1</hi> reverse dies causing some doubling of the design. The A<hi rend="sup">2</hi> reverse apparently basined better than the A<hi rend="sup">1</hi> reverse and required less individual touching up of the dies.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Linderman</persName> was quite concerned over the slow progress in producing the working dies, since the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> mint urgently needed them for producing in April the minimum 2,000,000 silver dollars prescribed by the <persName>Bland -Allison</persName> Act. In today's terms, 2 million coins a month seems a rather small figure but the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> Mint had, until then, never struck coins at that rate.</p>
               <p>In answer to a request by <persName>Linderman</persName> to <persName>Pollock</persName> on March 23 that <persName>"Barber</persName> and <persName>Morgan</persName> report in writing their progress in making new hubs and dies," <persName>Barber</persName> replied to <persName>Pollock</persName> (on the same day): <q>The new hub commenced when the Director was here will be
                     finished on the 28th of the Month and the dies therefrom I expect to ship on the 11th of April.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The second hub referred to in this letter was undoubtedly the new obverse hub (<ref target="fig-70">fig. 6</ref>).</p>

               <p>The new second design reverse hub had the eagle's tail feathers changed from eight to seven. Other changes in the reverse design included a
                  smaller wreath and smaller olive branch leaves and was of lower relief (<ref target="fig-71">fig. 7</ref>).</p>

                  <persName>Morgan</persName> further replied to <persName>Pollock</persName> on Monday, March 25: <q>I beg to say that the new hub
                     for reverse of silver dollar was finished and hardened today (March 25th). New dies from this hub will be ready about 2nd of April but I
                     can enter this hub into the dies - fifty in number made from the old hub and have these ready this week.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This letter from <persName>Morgan</persName> clearly explains how the seven over eight tail feathers reverse dual hub originated. It was
                  to be done as a matter of expediency, in order to save more than a week in obtaining the much needed working dies. That this short cut
                  operation was indeed carried out is indicated by <persName>Morgan's</persName> letter to <persName>Linderman</persName> on March 26:
                     <q>Today I have made and finished dies from the new hub for reverse of silver dollar with reference to which I reported to you yesterday.
                     These dies are now being used in the coining room by <persName>Mr. Downing</persName> - who is most competent to judge of these things
                     - prefers to use them for a few days before he gives an opinion as to how the dies will work.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The purpose of the detailed background which has just been given is to provide conclusive evidence how and why the 7 over 8 tail feather
                  variety occurred (<ref target="fig-72">fig. 8</ref>). (The seven over eight tail feather reverse shown is not unique as each modified die was
                  different and it was not a basic design type.)</p>
               <p>In summary, first, the new seven tail feather, parallel arrow feather (7 TF PAF) reverse hub of lower relief was entered into the old eight
                  feather reverse die. Presumably, since the two reverses had border lettering that differed in position with respect to the eagle, the old die
                  lettering, including the wreath, was ground and lapped away round the edge. When the new hub was entered into the old dies, only the center
                  part of the design had a doubled appearance. Dies actually begin as cones in order to prevent the metal from spreading, cracking and chipping
                  during each blow from the hub. Thus in order to finish the die in one or two blows from the hub, only the outer edge of the die could be
                  ground away. Since about 50 reverse dies were modified, it is likely that on some of these dies the old design <pb n="84"/> was probably
                  completely removed and the eight tail feathers did not show beneath the seven tail feathers. Only 13 different dual hub B/A reverse die
                  varieties are known. The other 37 A reverse dies may have been ground down sufficiently so that little of the original design remained. In
                  addition, some of these B/A reverse dies may have been condemned at the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> mint and never used.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-72">
                  <graphic url="COAC9_084.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>There is evidence that the lower relief, second design obverse hub was impressed on the old, higher relief obverse dies. These dual hub
                  obverses have doubled stars, LIBERTY, symbol letters, and other design details.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Linderman</persName>, however, was still not satisfied with the coins. On April 5, he wrote a letter concerning the relief of
                  the obverse silver dollar dies. <persName>Morgan</persName> replied on April 8: <q>I have come to the conclusion that the head is well
                     protected by the border when the dies do not sink or even when they sink a little, but when the dies sink as many of them did during the
                     last month the heads come much too close together, and in some coins which have been issued they would actually touch.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="85"/>
               <p>
                  <persName>Morgan</persName> went on to say: <q>Although Mr. <persName>Barber</persName> does not appear to take any great interest
                     in the finish of the dies himself, he has expressly forbidden <persName>Mr. Straub</persName> to receive any instructions from me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this letter it is apparent that <persName>Barber</persName> and <persName>Morgan</persName> were not on the best of terms,
                  probably because of <persName>Linderman's</persName> special interest in the young Englishman and adoption of <persName>Morgan's</persName> design for the silver dollar. The dies that <persName>Morgan</persName> believed should not have been allowed in the
                  presses were probably some of the seven over eight tail feather reverses and the double LIBERTY obverses. The letter also reveals that at the
                  time the new seven tail feather dies were first used.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Linderman</persName> was still not completely satisfied with the design, as indicated by his letter to <persName>Pollock</persName> on April 10: <q>I note a decided improvement in the execution of the silver dollar but I think there is room for some
                     further slight improvement...</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Linderman</persName> wrote to <persName>Pollack</persName> on April 15, ordering that the improvement be made: <q>You
                     expressed the opinion that further improvement in the new silver dollar is both practicable and desirable and the same can be accomplished
                     without interfering with the several designs or impairing improvements already made.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The two different coin designs caused some concern to the public. There were various inquiries to the Treasury Department and the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint pointing out the design differences and that they did
                  not stack up to the same height. The main concern was whether the new design coin was genuine.</p>
               <p>On May 17, <persName>Morgan</persName> reported to <persName>Linderman</persName> the progress on making the new dies: <figure xml:id="fig-73">

                     that you have received a piece struck from these dies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The two new pairs of dies mentioned in this letter struck the first coins of the third obverse and reverse designs (<ref target="fig-73">figs.
                     9</ref>-<ref target="fig-74">10</ref>). The C reverse is the so-called 1878 P 7 TF SAF (slanted arrow feather) type.</p>
               <p>The earliest date that the third design obverse and reverse dies could have been used extensively is June 28, 1878. This design was used for
                  practically all later years of the <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar series. Because of the large number of dies in the stockpile at
                  that time, many different die marriages occurred.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the remarkable story of the 1878 <persName>Morgan</persName> silver dollars. For those who would choose to collect all of the
                  1878-P varieties, it should be pointed out that as of this writing, there are 117 such varieties to whet one's collecting appetite.</p>

            <p>When the <placeName>United States</placeName> began the minting of silver dollars in 1794, it might reasonably have expected that the new coin
               would succeed in international trade.<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> The guldiner issued by Archduke Sigismund of the <persName>Tirol</persName> in 1486 is traditionally considered the first thaler. This was the first of many large silver crowns which circulated widely in
               international trade. It was followed by the issues of the Counts of Šlik at Joachimsthal around 1520, and finally by the introduction of a
               Spanish multiple of 8 reales sometime during the sixteenth century. Use of Spanish silver spread rapidly in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> after the founding of <persName>Manila</persName> in 1572. By the seventeenth century, 8 reales
               from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and her American colonies were the chief coins in use in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> trade.<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> Useful confirmation of this is provided by four Chinese hoards of
               Spanish and Spanish colonial coins, which were probably imported into <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> between 1645
               and 1690.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref> The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> trade was an unbalanced trade, a silver
               drain; Europe wanted tea, porcelain, spices, and silks, and the Chinese, who in many ways were more advanced than the Europeans, wanted nothing
               from Europe—the only thing they required was silver. Nor were all silver coins acceptable to the Chinese. Although many European trading
               companies tried to introduce imitation 8 reales of their own into the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> trade—such as
               the portcullis crown of the British <persName>East India</persName> Company, or the Emden trade thaler of the Königlich Preussische
               Asiatische Compagnie von Emden, there is no evidence that any of the coins were widely accepted in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>, and (in the case of the portcullis crown) good evidence that they were rejected.<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>If we were to map (<ref target="fig-75">figs. 1 and 2</ref>) the finds of Spanish- American silver coins, there would be few parts of the world
               where they would not penetrate. The only major exception would be the <persName>Baltic</persName> and its eastern European hinterland. This
               was because some trades developed their own specialized coins. The Levant trade used the <persName>Dutch</persName> leeuwendaalder; the
                  <persName>Baltic</persName> trade first the rijksdaalder, later the patagon, and these coins were themselves subject to imitation.<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> The <persName>Dutch</persName>, who have always been one of the most sophisticated trading nations, minted
               special silver crowns for special trades: the ducaton for the <persName>East India</persName> trade, the rijksdaalder for the Baltic, the
               leeuwendaalder for the Levant, and the patagon (or kruisdaalder, or Albertusthaler) for domestic transactions.<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref> The
               Banks of Hamburg and Amsterdam tariffed the less fine patagon (or kruisdaalder, or Albertusthaler) at the same rate as the old rijksdaalder, so
               by 1700 it drove out the rijksdaalder in the <persName>Baltic</persName> trade. The trade in the <persName>Baltic</persName> and much
               of Eastern Europe was dominated by this large silver coin, to the exclusion of the Spanish-American 8 real.<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref> There

            <p>good precedent for the striking of coins in imitation of successful trade dollars, although not all of these attempts proved to be
               successful.</p>
            <p>Everything seemed to favor a wide acceptance for the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar. Its likeness was not too different
               from the Carolus dollars, or 8 real pieces with the image of <persName>King Charles III</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, which were then the most widely accepted coin in southern <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>. By 1796 the <persName>U.S</persName>. silver dollar had reached <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>, and was described in the minutes of the British <persName>East India</persName> Company: <q>The
                  dollars brought by the Americans are a National Coin agreeing precisely in weight with the Spanish Dollar, but on assay have a few Cash more
                  of alloy; they are stamped with the Head of General <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> with fifteen stars and
                  the motto of "Liberty" dated 1795, and have on the Reverse an Eagle surrounded with Laurels and the Motto <persName>"United States of

            <p>The evidence we have for the circulation of the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar outside the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> is of three kinds. First of all, literary evidence; secondly, countermarks; and thirdly, hoards.</p>

            <p>Our literary evidence for the circulation of the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar is provided by money changer manuals, or
               cambists, which describe or depict the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar. One of the most widely quoted cambists is the
               beautiful work by <persName>Pierre-Frédéric Bonneville</persName>, published at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> at
               1806. Many later cambists cribbed their information from <persName>Bonneville</persName>. It looks as though <persName>Bonneville</persName> actually saw most of the coins he chose to depict, and he seems to have been careful to show all the major types: flowing
               hair and draped bust, large eagle, small eagle, and heraldic eagle (<ref target="fig-76">figs. 3</ref>, <ref target="fig-77">4</ref>, and <ref target="fig-78">5</ref>). There is, however, one major fault: <persName>Eric Newman</persName> has pointed out that <persName>Bonneville</persName> depicts a 1798 half dollar, a non-existent coin. <persName>Bonneville</persName>
               <pb n="91"/> also took over the edge lettering of the dollar wholesale and applied it to the half dollar. If <persName>Bonneville</persName>
               is accurate in depicting the silver dollars, he errs in his account of the gold coins, and appears to be the source of the error in early
               cambists which call the eagle a double eagle, and the half eagle an eagle.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref>
               <persName>Bonneville</persName> is the earliest work to depict a <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar that I have come
               across, although <persName>Eric Newman</persName> has discovered an earlier (1796) depiction of a <placeName>United States</placeName>
               coin (a 1795 eagle with thirteen leaves below the eagle; the variety may be a <persName>Breen</persName>. 2-A).<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref>

            <p>Rather different in quality is the work by the goldsmith <persName>James Ede</persName>, published in <persName>London</persName> in
               1808. Ede depicts a bust dollar, to which he assigns the date 1793 (<ref target="fig-79">fig. 6</ref>). Further comment is, I think,
                  superfluous.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Patrick Kelly</persName>, writing in 1821, gave a valid description of a dollar of 1795, but appears never to have seen a heraldic
               eagle dollar. He writes, "On the reverse of pieces of 1795 &amp;c. the Eagle is entirely surrounded with branches of palm and laurel." He also
               says that <pb n="92"/> "the inferior coins [i.e., below a dollar] have no letters on the edge," which indicates that he certainly never saw a
               half dollar, to say nothing of letter edged cents and half cents.<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref>

               <persName>Christian Noback's</persName> cambist, published at Rudolstadt in <persName>Thuringia</persName> in 1833,<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> is important as a means of transmission from <persName>Bonneville</persName> to the 1858 cambist of <persName>Frey and Blaser</persName> (<ref target="fig-80">fig. 7</ref>). The cambist of <persName>Xaver Frey</persName> and <persName>C. Blaser</persName>, published at <persName>Berne in Switzerland</persName> in 1858, has a woodcut that makes Liberty look very
               unpleasant (<ref target="fig-81">fig. 8</ref>). A com- <pb n="93"/> parison of their depiction of the 1795 dollar with those in <persName>Christian Noback</persName> and <persName>Bonneville</persName> makes it clear that <persName>Noback</persName> copied his
               depiction of the 1795 dollar from <persName>Bonneville</persName>, and <persName>Frey and Blaser</persName> copied their depiction from
                  <persName>Noback</persName>. The position of the edge lettering is the same in all three pictures; certain errors in the depiction of the
               edge decoration are carried over from picture to picture; and the unpleasant facial expression begins in <persName>Noback</persName> and is
               exaggerated in <persName>Frey and Blaser</persName>. So of these three cambists, only <persName>Bonneville</persName> saw an actual
               coin. <persName>Frey and Blaser</persName> base much of their information on Congressional legislation, so they thought that the <placeName>United States</placeName> struck dollars from 1786 to 1792. They also assume that dollars of the draped bust type were struck from
               1792 until 1837.<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1858 <persName>Christian Noback</persName>, this time assisted by his son <persName>Friedrich</persName>, issued another mercantile
               reference work: the <hi rend="italic">Münz-, Maas- und Gewichtsbuch.</hi> On page 519, the <persName>Nobacks</persName> say that the silver
               dollar was no longer being struck. This was 18 years after the striking of silver dollars had resumed, and clearly the <persName>Nobacks</persName> had yet to see one. The <persName>Nobacks</persName> also list as circulating coins some coins we consider patterns: the
               ring dollars and the ring cents. Although the <persName>Nobacks</persName> seem very accurate when discussing monetary matters in <persName>Rudolstadt</persName> or <persName>Königsberg</persName>, their account of silver dollars is incorrect. On the other hand, they
               provide a very good listing of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> gold.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Matters did not improve with time. The publishing house of <persName>von Vangerow</persName> in <persName>Bremerhaven</persName> issued
               a second edition of their cambist in 1868. This cambist illustrates a flowing hair dollar of 1795—with a small eagle reverse (<ref target="fig-82">fig. 9</ref>).<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref>
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The cambists, in short, are full of peculiar errors. <persName>Eric Newman</persName> has drawn attention to a cambist of <persName>Urosius Andreits</persName>, published in <persName>Budapest</persName> in 1832, which even goes so far as to depict an 1804 dollar—two
               years before the <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint created that fantasy piece.<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref>
               <placeName>United States</placeName> coins were made in only small amounts, and were rare- <pb n="94"/> ly seen; so it is not surprising that
               many errors crept into descriptions of the coins. Some authors, like <persName>Ede</persName>, went so far as to depict coins they had not
               seen. Others, like <persName>kelly</persName>, made broad assertions which were untrue. Many cambists copied uncritically from each other,
               making engravings or woodcuts not from actual coins, but from engravings and woodcuts in other cambists. The errors in the cambists are evidence
               for the small circulation of <placeName>United States</placeName> coins outside the borders of the United States.</p>

                  Girard</persName>, who is fantasizing about seeing a dollar (<ref target="fig-83">fig. 10</ref>). When <persName>Girard</persName> fantasizes
               about a dollar, he thinks about a <persName>Mexican</persName> 8 real with the head of <persName>Charles IV</persName>—not a <placeName>United States</placeName> dollar. The caricaturist could reasonably suppose, in other words, that the most important banker of the
               early Republic, and a banker who operated out of the very city in which the mint was located, when imagining a dollar would think of a <persName>Mexican</persName> dollar.<ref target="#CH7-n18">18</ref>

            <p>The second form of evidence we have for circulation of the silver dollar outside the <placeName>United States</placeName> is countermarks on
               silver dollars. Professor <persName>Robert Stark</persName> has enumerated the countermarks on silver dollars, foreign as well as
                  domestic.<ref target="#CH7-n19">19</ref> There are, to my knowledge, only thirteen early <placeName>United States</placeName> silver
               dollars in existence with foreign countermarks (including doubtful pieces), and two early <placeName>United States</placeName> dollars which
               were overstruck. One of the countermarked pieces is a dollar of 1794 with a <persName>Philippine</persName> countermark of 1811, which has
               not been seen since it disappeared during the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1861060">Japan</placeName>ese occupation of the <persName>Philippines</persName> in 1941.<ref target="#CH7-n20">20</ref> A <placeName>United States</placeName> dollar of 1795 has the Bank of <persName>England</persName> countermark of 1797-1803. Two of 1798 and two (or three) of 1799 have the octagonal countermark of 1804. Although
                  <persName>Michael Dolley</persName> contended that a 1798 dollar in the British Museum appeared genuine when the bust on the countermark
               was compared with the bust on the silver penny, <persName>Frederick Pridmore</persName> was suspicious of the authenticity of all of these
               pieces. In the case of one of the 1799 dollars <persName>Pridmore</persName> said outright that the countermark was not consistent with the
               silver penny.<ref target="#CH7-n21">21</ref>

               <persName>Harrington Manville</persName> is doubtful of the authenticity of this piece; he has written: <q>The <persName>J. &amp;
                     J. W. Hurlet1</persName> mark of the Copperas Coal Co. in <persName>Hurlet, Renfrewshire</persName> was discovered only in 1951 but in the
                  next twenty years at least ten specimens have appeared—from two different dies and including one on an American dollar. Although one or both
                  types may have been produced in early in the nineteenth century, their sudden appearance in several varieties is, at the least,
                     suspicious.<ref target="#CH7-n26">26</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Brunk</persName>, on the other hand, has said that "the countermark that includes a triangle of three dots is almost certainly
                  Original."<ref target="#CH7-n27">27</ref> The <placeName>United States</placeName> dollar does have this triangle of three dots.</p>
            <pb n="96"/>
            <p>The question of the authenticity of this countermark, as of so many others, is a problematic one; but it has no effect upon my conclusions. The
               total number of silver coins countermarked by private issuers in <persName>Britain</persName> during the Napoleonic era, surviving to the
               present day, is about 800. Of these, there are three countermarks on <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollars. Whether all three
               are genuine, or all three are fake, makes no matter; the point is that the number of surviving <placeName>United States</placeName> silver
               dollars countermarked in <persName>England</persName>, <persName>Scotland</persName>, and <persName>Ireland</persName>, is less
               than one half of one percent of surviving countermarked coins, with most of the other countermarks occurring on Spanish colonial silver. This
               suggests that the number of <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollars which were in circulation in <persName>Britain</persName>
               and <persName>Ireland</persName> in this period was also minuscule.</p>
            <p>An equally problematic area of countermarking is the <persName>West Indies</persName>. The only <placeName>United States</placeName>
               dollar with a <persName>West Indies</persName> countermark (the <persName>Puerto Rican</persName> examples excluded) is a cut out <persName>Guadeloupe</persName> holey dollar, about which there can be little doubt that it is a modern fake.<ref target="#CH7-n28">28</ref> In
               the <persName>West Indies</persName>, the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar and the <persName>Mexican</persName>
               silver dollar traded at par, even though the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar had slightly less silver. It was supposed to
               be profitable for merchants to engage in an "endless chain": ship <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollars to the <persName>West Indies</persName> and exchange them for <persName>Mexican</persName> dollars. This export of <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> silver dollars was the reason the Mint ceased to produce them after 1803, and why <persName>Jefferson</persName> formally
               suspended their minting in 1806.<ref target="#CH7-n29">29</ref> Why are there not more <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollars
               which were cut and countermarked in the <persName>West Indies</persName>, if the <placeName>United States</placeName> coins were
               gradually driving out the <persName>Mexican</persName> ones?</p>
            <p>One explanation may be that the authorities in the <persName>West Indies</persName> wanted to keep the <persName>Mexican</persName>
               silver in the country, and the <placeName>United States</placeName> coins out; they cut and countermarked the <persName>Mexican</persName> pieces, and rejected the <placeName>United States</placeName> coins. Another explanation may be that the endless chain or
               no, the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar was still a very scarce coin, and the tiny amounts made by the first <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint were totally swamped by the huge production of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName>.</p>
            <p>A rather unusual use of the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar occurred in <persName>Montevideo, Uruguay</persName>.
               There the country was besieged by the Argentine troops of General Rosas for nine years, which <persName>Alexandre Dumas père</persName>
               called "the modern siege of Troy." During this siege, emergency issues of pesos were made by the Montevideans. Women handed over their jewelry,
               men the saddle decorations of their horses, priests the crosses of the churches, and all were melted down to make the coins. At least five coins
               are known overstruck on other <pb n="97"/> coins. At least two such pesos are overstruck on early <placeName>United States</placeName>
                  dollars.<ref target="#CH7-n30">30</ref> One of them, a 1798 dollar (it appears to be a <persName>Bolender</persName>.8; the <persName>Uruguay</persName> reference is Silvera.7.1.1) is in the ANS collection, (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1987.81.42">1987.81.42</ref>, the gift of Howard W. Herz).<ref target="#CH7-n31">31</ref> The undertype of the siege peso in the ANS collection has a visible date—1798. Although this is another example of
               an exported <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar, these silver dollars are only two examples, compared with other, more common
               undertypes. Furthermore, the ANS example has prooflike surfaces, which suggests that it saw no circulation at all, but was a prestige issue made
               for local dignitaries. It is interesting to note that the number of such coins known—five—corresponds almost exactly to the number given out at
               the ceremony when the Montevideo mint was opened, namely four. One peso apiece was given to the President of the Republic, the Interior Minister,
               the Minister of War and the Finance Minister. The other coin known would have gone to someone like <persName>Don Andrés Lamas</persName>,
               the governor of <persName>Montevideo</persName>, who helped set up the mint. The mint had much trouble purifying the silver brought in, and
               was trying to use cupolation.<ref target="#CH7-n32">32</ref> This provides a simple explanation why the mint overstruck these coins. It needed to
               make presentation pieces in time for the ceremony, and the best possible planchets were existing coins— including two <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> silver dollars.</p>
            <p>The third form of evidence we have available to us is hoards. An argument <hi rend="italic">e silentio</hi> is a weak one, but the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar is absent from nearly all foreign hoards of this period known to me. The Wellington Bridge
               (1954) hoard, for example, which was found in <persName>Ireland</persName>, had a closing date of 1807. It contained 143 silver coins; 70 of
               these were 8 reales from <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName>, <persName>Lima</persName>, and <persName>Potosí</persName>. There was not a single <placeName>United States</placeName> coin in the hoard.<ref target="#CH7-n33">33</ref> To my
               knowledge, there is one, and only one, foreign find of coins of this period which contains <placeName>United States</placeName> silver
               dollars. This is a shipwreck found at Point Cloates off the coast of Western <persName>Australia</persName>, known as the <hi rend="italic">Rapid</hi>, which sank in 1811. The <hi rend="italic">Rapid</hi> is extremely interesting for us, because it is a <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> merchant ship, which had left the port of <persName>Boston</persName>. It gives a good idea of the silver trade coins
               available for a ship about to leave Boston for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>. 20,000 silver dollar size coins were
               found in the <hi rend="italic">Rapid.</hi> Of these coins, 13 were <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollars. The proportion of
               20,000 eight reales to 13 <persName>U.S</persName>. dollars is rather overwhelming. And this is on a ship which set out from <persName>Boston</persName>!<ref target="#CH7-n34">34</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Another hoard which is suggestive in indicating the scarcity of the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar is the Donner Lake,
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> (1891) hoard. An 8 reales of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName>, dated 1845, closes the hoard. Every <pb n="98"/> indication justifies the assumption that this hoard was buried by <persName>Mrs. Mary Graves</persName>, a member of the Donner party, on or before December 16, 1846, when the party abandoned the camp at the
               lake. The story of the Donner party, the pioneers who were caught in the snows of the <persName>Sierra Nevada</persName> and resorted to
               cannibalism, is well known. What is of interest is the composition of the hoard (<ref target="fig-84">fig. 11</ref>). A remarkable aspect is the
               predominance of French five franc pieces, which is unexpected. The large number of <placeName>United States</placeName> half dollars is what
               we would expect, for the half dollar was the true workhorse coin of the early <placeName>United States</placeName>. The early <placeName>United States</placeName> mint devoted its effort to one denomination in each metal: for copper, it was the cent; for silver, the half
               dollar; and for gold, the half eagle. Most significant is the total absence of the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar from
               this hoard—even though minting of the coin had resumed in 1840—and its replacement in monetary circulation not only by <persName>Mexican</persName> 8 reales and <persName>U.S</persName>. half dollars, which we expect, but also by French five franc pieces.<ref target="#CH7-n35">35</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>The literary evidence, the countermarks and overstrikes, and the hoard evidence all combine to suggest that the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> silver <pb n="99"/> dollar before I860 had only a tiny circulation within the <placeName>United States</placeName> itself,
               and an infinitesimal circulation outside of the United States.</p>
            <p>In the 1860s a number of factors prevented <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName> from supplying dollars to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> trade. First of all, the adventure of Maximilian in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName> resulted in great turmoil, which cut the production of the <persName>Mexican</persName> mints.
               Secondly, both Maximilian and his opponents changed the design of the eight reales piece, renaming it the peso. The Chinese, always sensitive to
               the slightest change in design, rejected the new coins. Furthermore, after the Republican defeat of Maximilian, an export tax of about 12% was
               levied on each peso exported.<ref target="#CH7-n36">36</ref> These changes made it attractive for other countries to begin minting their own
               silver coins for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> trade. The first of these was <persName>Britain</persName>,
               which began minting trade dollars for Hong Kong. These were not particularly successful, partly because Chinese merchants liked to chop the
               coins, and some of them feared that placing a chop on <persName>Queen Victoria</persName> might be considered <hi rend="italic">lèse
                  majesté.</hi> Many chopmarks are placed over the eyes of the head on the coins. This may be related to the way the Chinese perceived the
               portraits—as pictures of devils. The Chinese called the Carolus dollar "Gwei-mien," or "Devil's face," the <persName>U.S</persName>. trade
               dollar a "Devil's head."<ref target="#CH7-n37">37</ref> A traditional method of counteracting an evil influence is to knock out its eyes—compare
               the western superstition of the evil eye. So the tendency to chopmark the eyes may very well be intentional.</p>
            <p>The second nation to mint its own trade dollar was <placeName corresp="#geonames_1861060">Japan</placeName>, which began to mint a silver yen
               with the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> trade in mind. The third nation was the United States.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>John Willem</persName> has covered the history of the <persName>U.S</persName>. trade dollar extremely well in his superb
                  book.<ref target="#CH7-n38">38</ref> The <placeName>United States</placeName> trade dollar was not a failure—in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> it experienced a modest success. Some
               25 million trade dollars were exported to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>. Although the trade dollar made no headway
               in the north of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> and in the interior, it was readily accepted in the southern ports
               and in the <persName>Philippines</persName>. <persName>Dr. de Jesus</persName> writes that trade dollars of the dates 1873-78 were
               common at one time in <persName>Manila</persName> but became scarcer as more were melted to make silverware and jewelry; the most common
               trade dollar in <persName>Manila</persName> coin and jewelry shops was, unsurprisingly, 1877-S.<ref target="#CH7-n39">39</ref> Many trade
               dollars did see circulation, as we can tell from their chopmarks: in fact, chopmarked examples are known of all date and mintmark combinations of

            </p>
            <pb n="100"/>
            <p>The trade dollar, however, ended as an abject failure—not because of its career in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>,
               but because of what happened in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. In the 1870s huge new silver deposits were discovered in <persName>Nevada</persName>. At the same time, <persName>Germany</persName> and the <persName>Scandinavian</persName> countries
               adopted the gold standard. Old silver thalers (many dating from the eighteenth century) were turned into the Reichsbank in exchange for the new
               gold marks. The German government estimated that it had 5,500 metric tons of pure silver superfluous to its needs. Not all of this was sold at
               once—in 1879 the German government stopped the sales—but from 1873 until then <persName>Germany</persName> sold off 3,551.5 metric tons of
               pure silver, the equivalent of 147,567,208 standard silver dollars. Until 1876 this difficult task was entrusted to the newly founded Deutsche
               Bank, which had been established to specialize in foreign trade and in the person of <persName>Hermann Wallich</persName> had someone with
               direct experience of Asian markets. <persName>Wallich</persName> had served as the <persName>Shanghai</persName> branch manager of a
               French bank, the Comptoir d'Escompte. The Deutsche Bank disposed of 1,100 metric tons of silver. Most of it was sold into the <persName>London</persName> and <persName corresp="#geonames_2911298">Hamburg</persName> silver markets, but over 250 metric tons were sold directly
               in the East, in <persName>Bombay</persName>, <persName>Calcutta</persName> and <persName>Shanghai</persName>. The lovely old
               thalers were melted into bars before they were sold into the silver market. The one liquidation conducted in the form of coins was French 5 franc
               pieces which had formed part of the French indemnity or were found in the government tills when the German administration took over <persName>Alsace-Lorraine</persName>. <persName>Wallich</persName> presented these 5 franc pieces directly in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. After 1876 the Reichsbank took over the sales from the Deutsche Bank, selling most of the silver in
                  <persName>London</persName> to English banks. The Deutsche Bank had done quite well out of the business, and the Reichsbank wanted the
               profits for itself. Alas, the Reichsbank was disappointed; either because of its lack of skill or because the silver price gave way quite
               dramatically in 1877 and 1878, the Reichsbank suffered heavy losses and had to stop the sales in 1879.<ref target="#CH7-n42">42</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These various events combined to depress the silver price. The trade dollar, which in 1873 contained slightly more than a dollar's worth of
               silver, by 1876 was worth little more than eighty cents. The <placeName>United States</placeName> accordingly revoked the legal tender status
               of the trade dollar.<ref target="#CH7-n43">43</ref>
            </p>
            <p>At this point a crucial error by the <placeName>United States</placeName> government became very important. Colonies tend to be cash poor
               compared with the metropolis. Colonial coins often have a higher valuation than metropolitan issues. It is a traditional law of colonial monetary
               policy that colonial coins must have a distinguishing mark so that they do not get into circulation in the mother country. <persName>Portugal</persName>, <pb n="101"/> for example, prevented the circulation of Brazilian coins by giving them peculiar denominations such as 320,
               480, or 960. For years <persName>Britain</persName> enforced the rule that the monarch must always wear a crown on colonial issues, and be
               bareheaded on metropolitan ones. The United States, when creating a coin for export, ignored this rule, and created a coin which looked very much
               like a domestic <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar. It was possible for unscrupulous employers to buy the dollars at eighty
               cents, and put them in the pay packets of their workers with the valuation of a dollar. In 1887 the <placeName>United States</placeName>
               finally made good on its obligations, and redeemed the trade dollars by exchanging them for standard silver dollars—<persName>Morgan</persName> dollars—which were legal tender. Over 7.5 million trade dollars were redeemed this way.<ref target="#CH7-n44">44</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Although the <placeName>United States</placeName> trade dollar was a failure, it was a failure for domestic reasons. Its potential for the
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> trade remained, and other countries imitated it. In 1874 the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1861060">Japan</placeName>ese began to issue their own trade dollar, of the same weight and fineness as the <placeName>United States</placeName> one. In the 1890s, when the Mexicans finally adopted the name peso for their coin and began to export fewer pesos at the
               same time, other countries began minting trade dollars to fill the gap. The French began by minting a piastre de commerce for their territories
               in French <persName>Indochina</persName>. In 1921 this coin was struck for the French account at the <persName>San Francisco</persName>
               Mint, thereby giving a second life to a trade dollar from a <placeName>United States</placeName> mint. The British, too, resumed minting of a
               trade dollar, this time at <persName>Calcutta</persName>. The output of the British trade dollar was huge—over 21.5 million in 1898, over
               30.5 million in 1899. In 1900 the amount minted dropped to over 9 million for obvious reasons, namely the outbreak of the Boxer rebellion.<ref target="#CH7-n45">45</ref> Rather oddly, however, the Boxer rebellion expanded the area of acceptance of the British trade dollar. <persName>Dr. Knappe</persName>, the Imperial German Consul at <persName>Shanghai</persName>, wrote on October 3, 1900: <q>In consequence
                  of the massing of troops the demand for silver dollars has become very great and hence they have increased 10% in price. The English banks
                  have used this opportunity to introduce the English dollar, which until now has always been refused here. The <persName>Hong
                     Kong</persName> &amp; <persName>Shanghai</persName> Banking Corporation is said to have brought 4 million such dollars to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>, and the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank has also paid some of the sums requested from it by
                  the troops in English dollars.<ref target="#CH7-n46">46</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In 1901 over 27 million British trade dollars were minted; in 1902, over 31 million British trade dollars were minted.<ref target="#CH7-n47">47</ref>

            <p>The <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar, which began mintage the same year the trade dollar ceased to be minted for circulation, was not
               usually sought after as an international trade coin. The one time when it was exported on a large scale was during the inflationary period of the
               First World War, when all silver disappeared from circulation. The largest single export of silver dollars—265 million silver dollars— was the
               intergovernment transaction between <persName>Britain</persName> and the <placeName>United States</placeName> during the First World War
               when <persName>Britain</persName> needed silver bullion for <persName>India</persName>. These <persName>Morgan</persName> dollars
               were not, however, exported as dollars. They were melted first into silver bricks of 1,000 ounces apiece, and then sent in trains with armed
               guards across the continent to <persName>San Francisco</persName>, where they were loaded onto ships.<ref target="#CH7-n48">48</ref> The
               private sector in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> was another big purchaser of silver from the <placeName>United States</placeName> in 1919-20, and some of the silver was exported in the form of dollars, rather than as bullion bars.<ref target="#CH7-n49">49</ref> Generally speaking, however, the <persName>Morgan</persName> dollars only languished in Treasury vaults. Some
                  <persName>Morgan</persName> dollars did make their way to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</placeName>, where they
               received the fleur-de-lis counterstamp. Occasional <persName>Morgan</persName> and Peace dollars do turn up with chopmarks, but these are
                  oddities.<ref target="#CH7-n50">50</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1896 the experiment of the <placeName>United States</placeName> with silver coinage was the major issue of the presidential election. <persName>McKinley</persName> and the gold standard won the election. The gold standard became law in the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> in 1900. Yet history is filled with peculiar ironies: for <persName>McKinley</persName> was to be responsible for the
               introduction of another <placeName>United States</placeName> minted, circulating silver dollar on the territory of the United States.</p>
            <p>As a result of the Spanish-American War of 1898, the <placeName>United States</placeName> acquired a colonial empire, including the <persName>Philippines</persName>. The <placeName>United States</placeName> thereby occupied a country with a very complicated currency
               system; the <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Manila</persName> Times</hi> called <persName>Philippine</persName> currency: <q>an extremely mixed-up affair, so mixed up
                  that it constituted the study of a lifetime, and various people who devoted their lives to the study of it used to make money of it at the
                  expense of people whose time was otherwise occupied...at all times and under all circumstances the banks, exchange brokers and a few clever
                  Chinese and others managed to juggle with the fluctuations in change and currency legislation so as to score always.<ref target="#CH7-n51">51</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This description is colored by Sinophobia, but it does express the suspicion and hostility which many Filipinos felt, and which came to be shared
               by the <persName>U.S</persName>. troops. The continuing warfare against Aguinaldo tied down a large <placeName>United States</placeName>
               army of occupation. The troops were paid in gold dollars, or in paper money backed with <pb n="103"/> gold dollars. This, however, was no good in
               the <persName>Philippines</persName>, where only silver was used, and the local banks, including the <persName>Hong Kong</persName>
               &amp; <persName>Shanghai</persName> Banking Corporation and the Chartered Bank of <persName>India</persName>, <persName>Australia</persName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>, would convert these gold dollars into silver dollars before
               they would accept deposits. The soldiers complained greatly about the foreign exchange fees.</p>
            <p>The Filipinos similarly were confused by the introduction of the <persName>U.S</persName>. <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar, which,
               because it was tied to gold, was worth two pesos at the official rate even though it contained less silver than a peso. The <placeName>United States</placeName> government authorities considered several solutions. One proposal was to pay the troops in <persName>Mexican</persName> silver dollars. This was rejected because a lieutenant's weekly pay would then weigh 29 pounds, and a colonel's 73 pounds.</p>
            <p>The idea of introducing <persName>U.S</persName>. coins was considered and rejected. The <placeName>United States</placeName>, in the
               person of <persName>Charles A. Conant</persName>, finally adopted the suggestions of the British overseas banks, and introduced the system
               which had worked well in <persName>India</persName>, namely the gold exchange standard. <persName corresp="#viaf_29551966">John
                  Maynard Keynes</persName> has written that "In dealing with her dependencies, she [the <placeName>United States</placeName>] has herself
               imitated, almost slavishly, <persName>India</persName>."<ref target="#CH7-n52">52</ref> In other words, for foreign exchange purposes the
               country was on a gold standard, but domestically only silver would be used. There was no free coinage of silver. In 1903 this was put into force
               with the introduction of the <persName>Philippine</persName> peso (the "conant peso"), which was fixed to the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> dollar at a value of two pesos to one <placeName>United States</placeName> gold dollar.<ref target="#CH7-n53">53</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The gold exchange standard proved to be a very influential idea. Having put it into practice in the <persName>Philippines</persName>, the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> also used it when it reorganized the currencies of Panama and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</placeName> ("dollar diplomacy"). Keynes spoke quite highly of the gold exchange standard in his first published
               book, <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Indian</persName> Currency and Finance</hi> (1913). It was widely used in the interwar period as a substitute for the pure gold
               standard, and many of its concepts were taken up when <persName>Keynes</persName> and others established the <persName>Bretton</persName> Woods system in 1944.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the <placeName>United States</placeName> government got it wrong again. A gold exchange standard could work in <persName>India</persName> with little problem, because <persName>India</persName> was relatively self-sufficient. The <persName>Philippines</persName>, however, lie opposite southern <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>, and in its economic sphere of
               influence. If the trade dollar had been overvalued versus its bullion value, so that trade dollars flooded into the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName>, the new <persName>Philippine</persName> peso was drastically undervalued in terms of bullion, so the peso fled the <persName>Philippines</persName>, many going across the <persName>Manila</persName> straits to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName>, as numerous chopmarked examples attest. <pb n="104"/> The government accordingly reduced the size of
               the <persName>Philippine</persName> peso in 1907, so that it would be worth more than its bullion weight, and this adjustment seems to have
               worked.</p>
            <p>The history of the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar, as an international trade coin, was a history of failure. Why?</p>
            <p>First of all, for the greater part of its early history the <placeName>United States</placeName> did not produce much silver. It could not
               make many silver coins: the <placeName>United States</placeName> only minted $1,758,493 worth of all five silver denominations (half dimes,
               dimes, quarter dollars, half dollars, and dollars) between 1794 and 1803. By contrast, the <persName>Mexican</persName> mint turned out
               $211,991,719 worth of silver coin in that same period.<ref target="#CH7-n54">54</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The amount of silver coined by the <persName>Mexican</persName> mint each year was more than ten times the entire silver coinage of the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> mint in 1794-1803. Furthermore, so long as <persName>Mexican</persName> coins were just as good
               as <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollars, there was no inducement for merchants to bring them to the mint to recoin them into
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollars: they would have lost interest on their money. (The interest lost while waiting for
                  <persName>Mexican</persName> dollars to be recoined into <persName>U.S</persName>. dollars is often insufficiently emphasized as a
               reason for small mintages in the early years of the Republic. <persName>Willem</persName>, for example, does not mention it.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the time the <placeName>United States</placeName> began to produce silver in large quantities, it had fallen out of favor as a
               currency standard, replaced by gold monometallism. Only in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">China</placeName> was silver still widely
               accepted, and the <placeName>United States</placeName> acted ineptly, creating a coin which was easily introduced into circulation in the
               domestic market. The <placeName>United States</placeName> did produce one very popular trade coin for the nineteenth century: this was the
               gold double eagle, which remains a popular asset outside the United States, not least among Swiss banks. But it did not succeed in producing a
               silver trade coin.</p>
            <p>Finally, after the <placeName>United States</placeName> had itself adopted the gold standard, it was compelled to reintroduce a circulating
               silver dollar size coin into one of its territories, namely the <persName>Philippines</persName>. But even in the <persName>Philippines</persName>, in silver's classic area of circulation, the <placeName>United States</placeName> government could not get the
               gold-silver ratio right, and had to reduce the size of the coin, until it was smaller than the classic silver dollar.</p>

            <p>1. On November 11, 1834, <persName>President Jackson</persName> directed that a complete set of the coins of the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> be prepared by the <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint for presentation to certain foreign rulers and specified "each kind now
               in use." Another order for additional dignitaries soon followed. For presentation purposes proof coins were deemed desirable.</p>
            <p>2. It was thought by the Mint officials that to make a better impression on the foreign dignitaries the largest coins which the <persName>U.S</persName>. had minted should be included in the sets, even though the largest coins (the silver dollar and the gold Eagle) had
               not been minted for about 30 years and were not "in use" (in circulation) in 1834. To locate choice examples of previously issued early dollars
               and Eagles was apparently not considered satisfactory or practical for the purpose.</p>

            <p>3. There was a major problem in late 1834 if the Mint determined to include a silver dollar and a gold Eagle in each presentation set. The
               punches and dies for lower silver and gold denominations for the year 1834 had been prepared earlier in the year and before the presentation set
               matter arose (see figs. A, B, and C). Since no silver dollars or gold Eagles had been minted for 30 years no new device punches or dies had been
               prepared for those denominations during that long interval. A substantial amount of work and time would be required for the Mint to engrave new
               obverse and new reverse device punches for both a silver dollar and a gold Eagle to match current designs on the lower denomination coinage. Dies
               could be made more quickly and with less work than device punches, but device punches had to be available for dies to be made. Since device
               punches over 30 years old with obsolete designs happened to be available in 1834, the thought arose that the preparation of new device punches
               with properly matching designs might be avoided in preparing dies for the silver dollars and gold Eagles for presentation sets, as many of the
               obsolete ornament, letter and numeral punches had also been retained. The use of the available obsolete device punches to make dies for silver
               dollars and gold Eagles would save extensive work and time but would result in those coins not matching the designs on the current 1834 coins
               prepared for the presentation sets. A problem was what date might be cut into those dies. If those two denominations were to be prepared with
               obsolete designs and dated 1834 a major criticism from American officials and others would obviously have been justified for the creation of
               previously non-existent coins which did not match the current designs. Was there a proper way to save the work and time to make new device
               punches and to create a silver dollar as the largest silver coin and the Eagle as the largest gold coin for the few presentation sets needed?</p>
            <p>4. The officially published annual <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint Reports for 1804 and 1805 stated that dollars were "made" by the Mint in
               the years 1804 and 1805. The handwritten detailed records indicate that these pieces consisted of Spanish-American dollars of various dates and
                  <persName>U.S</persName>. dollars dated earlier than the year 1804. No <persName>U.S</persName>. dollar coinage of any kind occurred
               in 1805. The coinage of silver dollars was banned by order of <persName>President Jefferson</persName> on May 1, 1806.</p>
            <p>5. Because of such officially published statistics, some Mint officials in 1834 had reason to believe that <persName>U.S</persName>. dollars
               dated 1804 might have been minted in 1804 and 1805, but found none in the <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> collection at the Mint.</p>
            <pb n="115"/>

            <pb n="116"/>
            <p>Such a belief, although erroneous, was apparently still held in 1842 when <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> and <persName>Du
                  Bois</persName> published <hi rend="italic">A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins</hi> and illustrated the type of <persName>U.S</persName>.
               dollar for the "1797-1805" period as having an 1804 date.<ref target="#AP1-n2">2</ref> That period was obviously derived from the officially
               published Mint Reports rather than the handwritten detailed records. The authors knew however that their book illustration was of an 1804 dollar
               coined by the <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint in 1834 from dies cut in 1834. The use of the illustration was an effort to help justify and
               cover up what the Mint had done in 1834.</p>
            <p>6. The officially published annual U. S. Mint Reports for 1804 and 1805 accurately stated that gold Eagles were "made" by the Mint in 1804 and
               none in 1805 (fig. D). The <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> collection had retained an example of an Eagle dated 1804 since its coinage in
               1804. Feeling they needed proof coins for presentation, the Mint determined to use available obsolete punches to make a pair of new dies in 1834
               for an Eagle dated 1804 and strike coins with them.</p>
            <p>7. All denominations of <persName>U.S</persName>. gold and silver coins minted prior to 1828 had a circle of dentils around the border of
               both obverse and reverse extending radially to the circumferential edge. In 1828 the border design of dimes was modified to a circle of beading
               within and touching a thin flat raised band along the circumference. This same change of design was applied to half dimes in 1829 and to reduced
               diameter quarters in 1831. The modified border first appeared on production coinage of half dollars late in 1836, but is also found on both faces
               of experimental proof half dollars dated 1833, 1834 and 1835 (see above, fig. A). The modified border design is found on the dollars dated 1804
               and on the proof dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803 which are die-linked through the reverse die to the Class I dollars dated 1804. The modified
               border design was adopted for production coinage for each denomination to coordinate with the further development of a one-piece collar die (the
               close or closed collar) to use in striking those coins. A one-piece collar die for dollars was not available for use in production coinage until
               steam powered presses were introduced at the <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint in 1836 for Gobrecht dollars which also have the modified
               border.</p>
            <p>8. The Class I dollars dated 1804 were individually struck during 1834 for presentation sets on the <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint's
               available medal press using a smooth collar die from which the coin was not extracted automatically (fig. E). During striking the smooth collar
               crushed the <pb n="117"/> edge lettering which had been put on the planchet by the available Castaing machine and old edge lettering dies. Class
               II and Class III dollars dated 1804 and the proof dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803 were not prepared in 1834 and were struck many years
               later.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-89">
               <graphic url="COAC9_117.jpg"/>
               <p>E. Silver dollar dated 1804 struck in 1834 from dies prepared in late 1834 from retained obsolete punches with device designs having a draped
                  bust facing right with uncovered hair on the obverse and an heraldic eagle holding 13 arrows on the reverse. No dollars had been coined for 30
                  years prior thereto.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>9. The May 1, 1806 presidential ban on coinage of <persName>U.S</persName>. dollars was officially terminated on April 18, 1831, because of
               the stabilization of the silver to gold value ratio, but no silver dollar coinage, no silver dollar pattern and no silver dollar device punch
               resulted and none were then planned. <persName>Franklin Peale</persName> went to Europe in 1833 to study new minting techniques.</p>
            <p>10. If either new device punches or new dies cut with such new punches had been prepared for dollar production in 1831 they would have borne
               capped bust designs facing left similar to those on the then current subsidiary silver coinage or entirely new designs, rather than a
               retrogression to the long abandoned draped bust facing right design and the heraldic eagle design used for dollars and other subsidiary silver
               coins during the period just prior to 1804.</p>
            <p>11. Even though there was no specific restriction against coinage of the dollar and Eagle denominations in 1834 it might have been contrary to
               authority or protocol (as well as the November 11, 1834 instructions) to coin denominations not currently minted.</p>
            <p>12. The Mint officials were constantly aware that under the law coins were to be dated with the year in which they were struck. In attempted
               compliance with that rule in the past the Mint had created <pb n="118"/> ugly overdating, but there were often minor technical <persName>violations</persName> of the law when carryover dies from the preceding year (occasionally two or three years) were used because they were still
               in satisfactory condition and it was economically sound to use them until they wore out or broke. The minting in 1834 of a coin dated 1804 from
               newly prepared dies was clearly contrary to law and not within the foregoing accepted conservation practice.</p>
            <p>13. The idea of antedating the dies for the dollar and the Eagle to a year in which the Mint officials speculated or knew such coinage had been
               minted was selected as a way of handling the diplomatic gift matter with only a modest amount of impropriety or illegality.</p>
            <p>14. Mint officials believed that no one (particularly foreign rulers) would know the difference between a dollar made in 1834 but dated 1804 and
               a dollar coined in and dated 1804, but if that fact was learned it was believed that no one would be concerned. This thinking would also have
               applied to any dollars dated prior to 1804 which might be minted in 1834 with newly prepared dies.</p>
            <p>15. Mint officials therefore considered the possibility of using such dates as 1801, 1802 or 1803 for dollars to be coined in 1834 for the
               presentation sets as they positively knew that there were coins of such dates in the <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> collection but were not
               certain whether there was or was not a dollar coined in 1804 with an 1804 date.</p>
            <p>16. Mint officials also believed that no one (particularly foreign rulers) would know the difference between an Eagle made in 1834 but dated 1804
               and an Eagle coined in 1804 and dated 1804, but if that fact was learned it was believed that no one would be concerned. Similarly if an Eagle
               dated 1804 coined in late 1834 contained the larger gold content effective in 1804 rather than the reduced standard effective under the June 28,
               1834 Act, this would be helpful to the deception. Available obsolete device and other punches were used in 1834 to create Eagle dies with the
               obverse die dated 1804 and that pair of dies was used to strike Eagles with the gold content effective in 1804 rather than the gold content
               required in late 1834. The Eagle obverse die which was cut in 1834 had no crosslet on the 4 of the date and otherwise differed slightly from the
               Eagle obverse die used in 1804 for striking Eagles dated 1804, all of which had a crosslet on the 4 of the date. The new heraldic eagle reverse
               die used for the $ 10 Eagle struck in 1834 differs from all other known heraldic eagle reverse dies of $ 10 Eagles of any date <pb n="119"/> and
               also from all other heraldic eagle reverse dies used at any time for silver half dollars (the heraldic eagle reverse dies on these silver half
               dollars being the same size and style as those dies used for the gold Eagles). The border beading on the obverse and reverse dies of the Eagles
               dated 1804 and struck in 1834 differed from the dentils on the borders of the Eagles dated 1804 and struck in 1804. The raised reeds on the edge
               of the Eagles struck in 1834 were narrower and greater in number than the raised reeds on the edge of the Eagles struck in 1804. Thus the making
               and use of new dies in late 1834 to strike Eagles dated 1804 with an improper weight and an improper date created Eagle novodels and illegal
               Eagles (fig. F).</p>
            <p>17. In view of the uncertainty of Mint officials in 1834 as to whether dollars dated 1804 had or had not been struck in 1804 and to avoid
               possible criticism on that account it seemed practical to have alternate dates to choose from and obverse dies dated 1801, 1802 and 1803 were
               made up at the same time as the new obverse die dated 1804 was cut. When cutting these four obverse dollar dies with the old bust punch (probably
               brittle from prior use) a curl on the top of the head of that device punch broke off after it was used on the first two pieces of die stock. This
               went unnoticed. In preparing the four obverse dies the four selected dates were punched in randomly. Each die thus had an equal chance of having
               either a complete curl or a broken curl. It so happened that the die dated 1804 had a broken curl as did the die dated 1801. The dies dated 1802
               and 1803 each had an unbroken curl.</p>
            <p>18. Because four differently dated obverse dies happened to be prepared for coining the dollar for the presentation sets there were several
               obverse dies available for substitution in case of obverse die breakage. Only two reverse dies were prepared because either could be paired with
               any obverse die and one spare reverse die was adequate for possible substitution. This situation might explain why more obverse dies than reverse
               dies were prepared which was not a customary practice for production coinage.</p>
            <p>19. The fact that in 1834 the star punches used on the obverse dollar die dated 1801 and the figure punches for that die were of a different
               style than those used at the same time for obverse dollar dies dated 1802, 1803 and 1804 was coincidental as sets of various sizes of all these
               styles of punches were available in 1834 at the Mint because of prior use of those styles on other denominations of <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint coinage.</p>
            <pb n="120"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-90">

               <p>F (enlarged). Gold Eagle dated 1804 struck in 1834 with dies prepared in late 1834 from retained obsolete device punches. Obverse design with
                  a capped bust facing right and reverse design with an heraldic eagle holding 13 arrows. Date with no crosslet on 4.</p>
            </figure>
            <pb n="121"/>
            <p>20. It was deemed that only one new pair of dies was needed for the Eagle dated 1804 because striking a few gold coin examples in the medal press
               would not result in die breakage, particularly because gold was softer than silver and the Eagle was thin. Because it was then known that Eagles
               dated 1804 had been coined in 1804 no other substitute dates were needed for making Eagles for the presentation sets.</p>
            <p>21. The obverse dollar die dated 1804 and the reverse die (designated variety X) were selected for use in minting the dollars for the diplomatic
               coin sets and the extra examples. The Mint officials in 1834 therefore created an unknown dollar dated 1804 hoping or thinking that they had
               reproduced a previously existing coin. The dollar dated 1804 thus created was a novodel dollar and an illegal dollar.</p>
            <p>22. The remaining 1801, 1802 and 1803 obverse dollar dies and the remaining reverse die (designated variety Y) were not needed or used for the
               preparation of the diplomatic coin sets and were (along with the dies which were used for that diplomatic purpose) available for devilment and
               connivance thereafter. From these dies novodel dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803 were made in later years as well as dollars dated 1804 known as
               Class II and Class III 1804 dollars. The word "restrike" is improperly applied to the novodel dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803 as there are no
               known prior strikes using any of their obverse dies. Their reverse die however had been used in 1834 for the Class I 1804 novodel dollars.</p>
            <p>23. In the exchange with <persName>Matthew A. Stickney</persName> on May 9, 1843, the Mint traded a dollar dated 1804 for a 1785 Immune
               Columbia gold piece. Both parties received coins not struck at the time of their dating and each probably thought he was fooling the other.</p>
            <p>24. The affidavits and letters of Mint officials inferring or stating that the dollars dated 1804 were coined in 1804 were a deliberate attempt
               to cover up their mistakes and improper acts undertaken at the Mint in 1834 or early 1835 when the coins dated 1804 for the presentation sets
               were being prepared.</p>
            <p>25. The experimental proof half dollars dated 1833, 1834 and 1835 (previously referred to in section 7), in addition to having beading inside a
               raised thin flat border band on both faces: (I) have planchets which were edge lettered before striking; (II) have edge let- <pb n="122"/> tering
               which was crushed when struck in the <persName>U.S</persName>. Mint medal press; and (III) have the identical reverse die which was used in
               1836 for edge lettered half dollar production coinage in combination with a new obverse die dated 1836 having dentils extending radially to the
               circumference, such combination being known as Overton variety 106.<ref target="#AP1-n3">3</ref> Whether the 1833, 1834 and 1835 experimental
               proof half dollars were struck during the year of their dating or at some time prior to the transfer in 1836 of the reverse die to production
               coinage (when reverse die breaks occurred) does not seem certain. Thus the dies made for and the striking of such experimental proof half dollars
               may have taken place during late 1834 and thereafter. The above described 1836 half dollar variety appears to be the only <placeName>United States</placeName> coin which has a border with dentils extending radially to the circumference on one face and beading inside a raised
               thin flat border band on the other face.</p>

            <p>In the course of looking for suitable items for exhibit in connection with the Coinage of the Americas Conference on the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver dollar, I found a pair of dies for the 1883-CC <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar among the collection (<ref target="#fig-91">figs. 1</ref>-<ref target="#fig-92">2</ref>).</p>

            <p>Old dies from the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint have been in the hands of collectors since the very beginnings of interest in
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> coinage; one of the earliest American coin collectors, <persName>Joseph J</persName>. <pb n="125"/>
               <persName>Mickley</persName>, came into possession of various old dies and seems to have been behind the production of a number of restrikes
               using them, notably the 1804, 1810, and 1823 cents. None of the dies used for those cent restrikes are now in the ANS collection, but the ANS
               does have the obverse die for an 1818 large cent. Although used dies have been part of the collecting scene since the 1850s, if not before, they
               have been relatively little studied and catalogued, at least compared with the attention that has been given to the coins. For example, <persName>Walter Breen</persName> mentions in his encyclopedia that restrikes have been made using the die of the 1805 quarter (Browning
                  2),<ref target="#AP2-n1">1</ref> but he did not mention that the die has ended up in the collection of the ANS (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1923.33.2">1923.33.2</ref>, gift of <persName>M. Knoedler</persName>, probably from the <persName>Ellsworth</persName> estate).</p>
            <p>The two <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar dies in the ANS collection have the numbers <ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1940.53.1">1940.53.1</ref>-<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1940.53.2">2</ref>; they are the gift of <persName>T. James Clarke</persName> in 1940. The dies have been cancelled by putting a large X-shaped gash in them. They are significantly larger than the
               dies the ANS has from the early nineteenth century, indicating the progress of minting technology, which moves toward larger and heavier
               dies.</p>
            <p>The Carson City Mint numbered its dies. On the side of the die with the head of liberty is the mark "No 17"; on the side of the die with the
               eagle is the mark "No. 14/1883."<ref target="#AP2-n2">2</ref> A date was not necessary on the head die because the head has the date below it.
               The mark of the date on the eagle die indicates that the Mint regarded the dies of one particular year as a discreet group by this time, and
               would not mix the reverse die of an earlier year with the obverse of a later one; thus if the Mint was doing its work properly, students of the
               die combinations of the <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar series should not come across any "biennial dies." It is interesting to note that
               the study of <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar die varieties by <persName>Van Allen</persName> and <persName>Mallis</persName>
               lists only seven different head dies and four eagle dies for the date and mintmark combination 1883-CC, so there are presumably many more to
               discover, judging by the numbers on the side of the steel dies in the ANS collection.<ref target="#AP2-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint did report the number of dies used to produce the coins in each year; but since the Mint, like
               the rest of the government, was on a fiscal year of July 1-June 30, the figures do not give us the true number of dies used in a calendar year.
               For July 1, 1882 to June 30, 1883, the Mint at <persName>Philadelphia</persName> made 20 dies for Carson City; and for July 1, 1883 to June
               30, 1884, the Mint made another 20 dies for Carson City. The figures in the reports must refer to dies, not die pairs, because the Mint was in
               the habit of using the same reverse die for the annual assay medal through the four years of a presidential administration, and it is only when
                  <pb n="126"/> the administration changes that the number of dies reported as made for the annual assay medal jumps from one to two. We can
               therefore deduce that the figures in the mint reports refer to individual dies, rather than die pairs. One might then assume that 20 dies were
               made for Carson City in the calendar year 1883. <persName>Q. David Bowers</persName>, in his 1993 work on silver dollars of the United
               States, gives the figure of 10 obverse dies and 10 reverse dies for Carson City; <persName>Bowers</persName> does not indicate whether this
               figure comes from the mint reports or from archival documents, but it might have been based on archival research by <persName>R. W.
                  Julian</persName>.<ref target="#AP2-n5">5</ref> This figure is, however, contradicted by the evidence of our dies: they suggest that Carson City
               received at least 31 dies (14 plus 17). In my opinion the figures in the mint reports are not to be trusted, and are just approximations. The
               Carson City die figures in general tend to be round numbers, which suggest that some <persName>clerk</persName> prepared rough estimates for
               the annual audit. The evidence of the dies also contradicts the evidence which apparently comes from archival research in the Mint, but the
               document in the archives may be similar rough figures prepared by the same clerk. This reinforces the significance of our dies, the evidence of
               which contradicts the evidence of the annual reports.</p>
            <p>The eagle die has a notch, which the liberty head die does not; this suggests that the eagle die was the fixed, lower die, and the liberty head
               die the upper, moveable one, which is confirmed by the studies of <persName>Van Allen</persName> and <persName>Mallis</persName>.<ref target="#AP2-n6">6</ref> In classical numismatics, the obverse is considered to be the lower die, because the lower die is fixed and breaks
               less than the upper die, and therefore the more complicated type is put on the lower die. This is also true of the <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar: the eagle side is the more complicated type, and is therefore the side a mint would want to be the fixed, lower die.
               One question we have not been able to solve is if the <persName>Philadelphia</persName> Mint prepared and sent out different numbers of head
               (strictly speaking, reverse) and eagle (strictly speaking, obverse) dies. The Mint should send out more head dies, because that die would break
               more frequently. The ANS dies suggest that would be the case: the head is die number 17, the eagle die number 14.</p>
            <p>In short, this pair of <persName>Morgan</persName> dollar dies indicates that the study of the actual dies themselves should be a fruitful
               area for further numismatic research, because their evidence often contradicts evidence from normal die studies and printed sources.</p>

               <p>I am using the expression "head die" and "eagle die" instead of obverse and reverse. Although common usage calls the head the obverse, and the
                  eagle the reverse, on two definitions: the side struck by the lower die, and the side with the title and emblems of the issuing authority, the
                  eagle side is the obverse, and the head side the reverse.</p>
