            </head>
            <p>The writing of this volume has been made possible through the kindness of the staffs of the Connecticut State Library, of the Library of the New-York Historical Society, of the American History Room of the <placeName>New York</placeName> Public Library and of the Yale University Library. The author wishes to express his special thanks to <persName>Mr. James Brewster</persName>, State Librarian of Connecticut, to <persName>Mrs. Marjorie Case Hartman</persName> and <persName>Mr. Wesley G. Dennen</persName> of the Connecticut State Library. The author is deeply indebted to <persName>Dr. James J. Heslin</persName>, Assistant Director of the <placeName>New York</placeName> Historical Society, and <persName>Miss Constance D. Sherman</persName> of the American Museum of Natural History, who read the galley proof and to <persName>Aurelia G. Scott</persName>, who read page proof of this book.</p>
            <p>Previous works dealing with counterfeiting in the Colonial Period either have not covered the entire period in a province or have been based on records which were incomplete because of the loss or destruction of documents and records. In <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, however, the minute books of the Superior Court in the Eighteenth Century have been preserved, as well as great quantities of papers relating to counterfeiting cases. As a result a fairly complete picture of counterfeiting in this colony can be given, and in many instances the false or altered bills are still preserved in the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> State Library.</p>
            <p>This book is intended primarily for numismatists but it is hoped that it will also be useful for economists, historians and genealogists. The arrangement of the chapters by periods of years has been one of convenience. The subject matter, concerned as it is with many individuals, may sometimes be found monotonous. It is hoped, however, that some characters and incidents will be sufficiently entertaining to enliven the pages of a work which, to a considerable degree, must of necessity be one of reference.</p>

            <p>Before the printing of bills of credit the currency of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> consisted of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> silver pieces, which passed at the value with which they were stamped, and "Sevil Pillar, or Mexico Pieces of Eight, of full Seventeen Peny weight," which passed at six shillings per piece, and half pieces, quarter pieces and one <hi rend="italic">real</hi> pieces. It was formally enacted that such money be current in the colony, <hi rend="italic">"Provided always,</hi> That such of the said Coynes, as pass by tale, be not diminished by Washing, Clipping, Rounding, Filing or Scaling."<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> The proviso would indicate that evil-minded persons were in the habit of thus diminishing the value of the coinage to their own profit or that the authorities anticipated such practices.</p>
            <p>The first recorded case of counterfeiting in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> is that of <persName>Robert Fenton</persName> in 1699. He had been in difficulties on the same score in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in 1683, when he, <persName>Samuel Buckley</persName> and <persName>Charles Pickering</persName> were arrested on suspicion of counterfeiting Spanish coin. <persName>Fenton</persName> and <persName>Buckley</persName>, who claimed that their mint was located outside of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, pleaded guilty, while <persName>Pickering</persName> was tried and convicted. <persName>Fenton</persName> had made the dies and had taken part in the coining, but, as he was only a servant, he was merely sentenced to sit in the stocks for one hour.<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Apparently at some time after his punishment <persName>Fenton</persName> removed to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, where he had a shop, presumably for metal work. He was not, however, satisfied with legitimate profits, and on January 13, 1699, he was brought before <persName>William Pitkin</persName>, assistant. <persName>Pitkin</persName> examined him closely, asking him first if he had
<pb n="2"/>
any false money, to which <persName>Fenton</persName> replied in the negative. When asked if he had any money, he admitted that he possessed one piece of eight, a half piece, two shillings, and eight pence, all of which he showed, denying that he had any other coin. At this <persName>Pitkin</persName> had him searched by a constable, who found in one of <persName>Fenton's</persName> pockets five pieces of eight, three half joes and one eight pence, all of which were judged to be false.<ref target="#CH1-n3">

            <p>
               <persName>Fenton</persName> then decided to make a clean breast of all he knew about the making of false Spanish and New England money. His declaration before three assistants, <persName>William Pitkin</persName>, <persName>Samuel Willy</persName> and <persName>Caleb Stanly</persName>, and <persName>John Haynes</persName>, a justice of the peace, was as follows: in the summer of 1698 he had been employed by <persName>Mr. John Potterfield</persName>, and the two men together had made about twenty pounds of "bitts" out of pieces of eight (about one shilling's weight of alloy was put in each piece of eight and of eight pieces of eight from fourteen to sixteen bits were struck) and likewise thirty or forty pieces of eight, each with two shillings' weight of alloy in it. <persName>Fenton</persName> received from <persName>Potterfield</persName> one pence for making each piece of eight and half the profit from the bits.<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Another person named by <persName>Fenton</persName> was <persName>John Tedman</persName> of Long Island, who induced <persName>Fenton</persName> to make stamps and tools for coining pieces of eight, half pieces, and bits, and together they struck some false money. <persName>Tedman</persName> paid him for his help with what he said was money of his own (<persName>Tedman's</persName>) making, and <persName>Fenton</persName> found that it wanted about half the weight of good coin. Later on, in 1698, about six weeks before <persName>Fenton's</persName> arrest, <persName>Tedman</persName> came to his shop and desired him to make stamps for dollars, which <persName>Fenton</persName> refused to do. <persName>Tedman</persName> said that he had one hundred and fifty pounds of Arabian metal to make up into money for a privateer about Southold. <persName>Fenton</persName> refused to help but did promise to call on him at Long Island in April or May and to fetch over ore and coal from <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Next <persName>Fenton</persName> mentioned <persName>John Hollam</persName> of <placeName>Stonington</placeName>, who, he said, met him at the smithy of <persName>James Dane</persName> in <placeName>Stonington</placeName> and spoke of ore and mines; yet he did not directly implicate Hollam in counterfeiting activities. Not so, however, in the case of <persName>Mr. Hornbuckle</persName> of <placeName>Northampton</placeName>, who, according to <persName>Fenton</persName>, called on him in the spring of 1698, spoke of metals and showed him a piece of eight. When <persName>Fenton</persName> said he thought it a good one, <persName>Hornbuckle</persName> said there was no silver in it but that he had cast it from block tin and copper mixed. <persName>Hornbuckle</persName> explained how he had cast it and stated that he had put off a considerable number of such counterfeit pieces by himself or through his landlord and others.</p>
            <p>Finally <persName>Fenton</persName> confessed that he had made some stamps or tools for one Messenger, a "joyner" of <placeName>Boston</placeName> – – he thought his name was <persName>Thomas</persName> – – where for about seven or eight years past he had kept his shop at the south corner of the "Scoole Lane."<ref target="#CH1-n5">

               <persName>Fenton's</persName> examination was owned in court on May 18, 1699, but it is not recorded what punishment he received or whether others were then prosecuted. It was doubtless as a result of the <persName>Fenton</persName> affair that the General Assembly in May, 1699, resolved
<q>"that it is the opinion of the Governour, Councill and Representatives in Generall Court assembled, That if any person be found guiltye of attempting and practising, the counterfeiting or clipping, rounding, filing or otherwise debasing any of the monies and coins currant in this Colonie, that it (is) in the power of the justices at their sessions (by virtue of the laws now in force in this Colonie) to bind such person (being thereof lawfully convicted) to good behaviour with sufficient sureties by the discretion of the justices before whome such delinquent shall be lawfully convicted; and if such delinquent shall not procure such surety, then may the justices comit such person to the comon gaole there to remain untill he shall be delivered, according to order of lawe."<ref target="#CH1-n6">

            <p>Early in the eighteenth century a new and fertile field was opened to counterfeiters. As <persName>Roger Wolcott</persName> put it, "in 1702, the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> put out bills of credit to pay their public debts; this was followed by the other <placeName>New England</placeName> governments. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> came into it in 1709."<ref target="#CH2-n1">

               </ref> The <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> authorities had had a taste of what they might expect to befall their paper money, for on August 10, 1704, at <placeName>Stonington</placeName> they captured <persName>Thomas Odell</persName>, who had been concerned in forging the twenty shilling bills of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and for whose capture the governor of that province had offered a reward of £30.<ref target="#CH2-n2">

He was tried on November 6 at the Superior Court of Judicature in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of £300 and costs and to spend one year in prison.

            <p>To protect its new bills against the machinations of such rogues as Odell the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Assembly in May, 1710, passed a law to this effect:
<q>Be it also enacted by the authority aforesaid, and it is hereby enacted, That such person or persons as shall be convicted before the courts of
<pb n="5"/>
assistants of counterfeiting any of the bills of credit created by the aforesaid acts, or confirmed, ratifyed and made good by this present act, shall pay all damages that shall accrue thereby, to be adjudged and awarded by the said court, upon conviction as aforesaid, and suffer six months imprisonment, and such other penalty, or corporal punishment, as the said court (respect being had to the degrees of such crime,) shall judge meet, or inflict; one moiety of the said fine to the publick treasury aforesaid, and the other moiety to him or them as shall in the said court sue for the same and prosecute his suit to effect.<ref target="#CH2-n4">

                  </ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The first person to suffer the penalties prescribed by this law was <persName>Ebenezer Seamore</persName> of <placeName>Farmington</placeName>. On June 10, 1710, <persName>Joseph Shepard</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName> showed to <persName>William Pitkin</persName>, assistant, a <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill altered to 10<hi rend="italic">s.,</hi> which he had lately received from <persName>Seamore</persName>. <persName>Pitkin</persName> at once issued a warrant for <persName>Seamore's</persName> arrest, and the same day the suspected counterfeiter was taken up and brought before Pitkin, who proceeded to examine him. The prisoner pretended innocence, though admitting freely that he had paid out a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill to <persName>Shepard</persName> the previous day. He explained that he had lately received bills of the treasurer, of <persName>Thomas Burd</persName>, of <persName>George Kilborn</persName>, of <persName>George Stillman</persName>, of <persName>Constable Sam Woodruff</persName> and of <persName>Josiah Woolcott</persName>. He admitted that he had tried to pass one 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill to <persName>Mr. Dod</persName>, who said it was counterfeit, and that he then showed it to <persName>John Woodruff</persName>, who thought it genuine. It was possible, he granted, that this was the same bill that he paid to <persName>Mr. Shepard</persName>.</p>
            <p>The next day, however, <persName>Seamore</persName> was examined again and then broke down, making the following confession: he had been at expense in court and, being in want of money, he decided to try his hand at counterfeiting. Thereupon he approached his cousin, <persName>John Woodruff</persName> of <placeName>Great Swamp</placeName> in <placeName>Farmington</placeName>, who at first cautioned him against the business and expressed the opinion that it was a cheat. Finally, however, they went to work, turning a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill into a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into a 40<hi rend="italic">s.,</hi> a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into a 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a number of other small bills into 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each. <persName>Woodruff</persName>, it seems, altered only two or three bills, then became

penitent, tried to dissuade <persName>Seamore</persName> from passing further altered notes and put off none himself. <persName>Seamore</persName> acknowledged himself alone to be at fault in the matter and added that he had passed the following counterfeits: one of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <persName>Mr. Stillman</persName>, a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the wife of <persName>John Curtiss, Sr.,</persName> one of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <persName>Thomas Moore</persName>, one of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <persName>Mrs. Allyn</persName>, one of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <persName>Jonathan Bidwell</persName>, one of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <persName>Captain Williamson</persName>, one of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <persName>Joseph Shepard</persName> and one of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <persName>Symon Chapman</persName> (<ref target="#fig-4">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> I</ref>-<ref target="#fig-5">II</ref>), while he still had at home one of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
            <p>Pitkin at once caused <persName>John Woodruff</persName> to be apprehended on June 18. The next day the prisoner made a full confession, stating that sometime in the spring <persName>Seamore</persName> came to him and showed him two bills which he, <persName>Seamore</persName>, had altered "when he was a dressing Shingles." The two men then tried to alter a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but could not make it do, whereupon <persName>Seamore</persName> tore out the figures he had written and put off the bill to <persName>Mr. Judd</persName>. Later on <persName>Seamore</persName> came again to <persName>Woodruff's</persName> house and, learning from <persName>Mrs. Woodruff</persName> that her husband was in the lot, <persName>Seamore</persName> came to him there with a number of small bills on which he had already scraped out the figures, and the men made a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill out of a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. note. Still later <persName>Woodruff</persName> remonstrated with his cousin about the counterfeiting and refused to have any further part in the business.</p>
            <p>As it appeared to the county court that one or more of the counterfeited bills had been burnt by <persName>Zachariah Seamore</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, <persName>Zachariah</persName> was summoned and questioned about the matter. He admitted that on the night of June 17, at the desire of his brother, <persName>Richard Seamore</persName>, he had gone to the house of <persName>Ebenezer</persName>, searched among his bills of credit and, finding one that was counterfeit, burnt it.</p>
            <p>On June 24 warrants were issued to summon the witnesses against <persName>Seamore</persName> at the court of assistants to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> on Monday, June 26, at ten in the morning. These evidences were <persName>Jonathan Hollister</persName>, the wife of <persName>John Curtis, Sr.,</persName>
               <persName>George Stillman</persName>, all of <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName>, <persName>John Hollister, Jr.</persName>, of "<placeName>Glassenbury</placeName>," <persName>Symon Chapman</persName> and his wife, <persName>Thomas Moore</persName>, <persName>Widow Elizabeth Allyn</persName>, all of <placeName>Windsor</placeName>, <persName>Zachary Sandford</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, <persName>Mary Wells</persName> and <persName>Edward

Dod</persName>. In addition <persName>Zachariah Seamore</persName> was required to attend to answer to whatever might be objected against him relating to the bills of credit.</p>
            <p>At the session of the court the Queen's Attorney charged <persName>Ebenezer Seamore</persName>, husbandman, with counterfeiting and passing. <persName>Seamore</persName> pleaded not guilty but was tried, convicted, and, on the following day, was sentenced to spend six months in prison, to pay a fine of £25, costs of £14/14/7 and prison fees and charges, while the keeper of the jail was instructed to secure him in irons. <persName>John Woodruff</persName>, who volunteered to turn Queen's evidence, was accepted as such, admitted his guilt, stated that he had burned the two bills he altered. Orders were given that he be not indicted, and he was discharged on payment of costs of £6/15/– and prison fees and charges. Zacharias <persName>Seamore</persName> was let off with the payment of costs of 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.<ref target="#CH2-n5">

               <persName>Ebenezer Seamore</persName> found the <placeName>Hartford</placeName> jail anything but comfortable and his fine and costs more than he cared to pay, so after a few months he petitioned the Assembly to release him and to abate his fine, requests which were denied on October io.<ref target="#CH2-n6">

            <p>Naturally persons to whom he had passed altered bills had suffered loss, and on March 9, 1711, the governor and council ordered the secretary, <persName>Caleb Stanly</persName>, to reimburse some individuals out of the fine paid by <persName>Seamore</persName>.

            <p>Counterfeiting and altering of bills of credit of the Colony of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> were forbidden by law but there was no such provision with respect to the paper money of neighboring colonies. In May, 1711, the Assembly took steps to rectify this situation, and a law was passed to the following effect:
<q>Be it Declared and Enacted by the Governour, Council and Representatives, in General Court Assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That whosoever shall presume to Forge, Counterfeit or Utter, any Bill or Bills (Knowing the same to be False and Counterfeit) of the Tenour, or in Imitation of any of the Bills of Credit of this Colony, or of the Bills of Credit of the Provinces of the <hi rend="italic">

               </head>
               <p>Early in January, 1712, <persName>William Barker</persName> and <persName>Samuel Munn</persName>, who were thought to have come together from <placeName>Okinoke</placeName> to <placeName>Milford</placeName>, were at <persName>Mr. Richard Bryant's</persName> house, where <persName>Munn</persName> paid the reckoning. Both men passed altered bills of credit, and on January 8 a complaint against <persName>Barker</persName> was made to <persName>John Ailing</persName>, assistant, at <placeName>Guilford</placeName>, who at nine o'clock that evening ordered a hue and cry after <persName>Barker</persName>, who was said to be a trader from <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and was thus described: "of red hair, a well made portly man, black wigg, light collourd loose Coat, dark Colourd straight Coat, speckled vest dark Colourd stock Stockings washt leather Breeches who is Charged with ye Crime of Counterfeiting or altering a five Shillings bill of this Colony to five pounds ..."</p>
               <pb n="11"/>
               <p>The object of the hue and cry was apprehended at Lyme the next day and was taken before <persName>Captain Ely, J.P.</persName>, of that town, who, after examining the prisoner, ordered the constable of <placeName>Saybrook</placeName> to take him to <placeName>New Haven</placeName>. On the road <persName>Barker</persName> broke away but was soon retaken and brought again before Justice <persName>Ely</persName>. The magistrate now ordered the captive's portmanteau searched, and in <persName>Barker's</persName> pocket-book were found three counterfeit bills, one of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. made into £5, one of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altered to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and one of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. raised to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<ref target="#fig-8">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> V</ref>-<ref target="#fig-9">VI</ref>).</p>
               <p>This paper money was sealed up by the justice, and the criminal was sent off again under guard to <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, where he was examined by <persName>Warham Mather, J. P</persName>. It was discovered that <persName>Barker</persName> had stopped at a tavern in <placeName>Killingworth</placeName>, at <placeName>Eastchester</placeName> and at the house of <persName>Abraham Chanker</persName>, to whom he had passed a counterfeit 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill to pay a reckoning of about ⅛. He likewise had uttered to Tavernkeeper Stiles in <placeName>Milford</placeName> a counterfeit 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill, no. 3931, which is preserved in the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> State Library.<ref target="#CH3-n2">

               </p>
               <p>Justice <persName>Mather</persName> and <persName>John Ailing</persName> committed their prisoner to the jail in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> on January 11 but three days later, as was reported by <persName>Sheriff Joshua Hotchkiss</persName>, <persName>Barker</persName> broke prison and made his escape despite a vigorous pursuit, in the course of which three men set out from <placeName>Branford</placeName> in the hope of overtaking the fugitive, <persName>Seth Morse</persName> and <persName>John Hoadly</persName> to <placeName>Guilford</placeName> and <persName>Jacob Carter</persName> to <placeName>Killingworth</placeName>, all under the supervision of Constable <persName>Isaac Foot</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n3">

               <p>
                  <persName>Barker's</persName> acquaintance, <persName>Samuel Munn</persName> of <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>, was not as fortunate as his companion. At <placeName>Milford</placeName> on January 7, 1712, <persName>Samuel Eells</persName>, assistant, acting on a complaint lodged by <persName>Samuel Stone</persName> of that town, issued a warrant to Deputy Sheriff <persName>Gideon Buckingham</persName> to arrest <persName>Munn</persName>. <persName>Stone</persName> charged that on the morning of January 7 at the house of <persName>Edward Wilkinson</persName> in <placeName>Milford</placeName>
                  <persName>Munn</persName> offered a <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>
                  <pb n="12"/>
5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> bill altered to £5 to <persName>Wilkinson</persName>, who refused it, and then to <persName>Samuel Clark, Jr</persName>. About nine or ten o'clock <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Samuel Stone</persName> arrived and together with <persName>Wilkinson</persName> pointed out to <persName>Munn</persName> that the bill was altered. <persName>Munn</persName> told them that he had received it from <persName>Samuel Hawley, Sr.</persName>, of <placeName>Stratford</placeName> and that he would go at once to <placeName>Stratford</placeName> to induce <persName>Hawley</persName> to take back the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Munn</persName> was apprehended the same day that the warrant was issued and he was examined before Justice <persName>Eells</persName> and <persName>Jonathan Law, J.P.</persName> At first he told the magistrates that he got the counterfeit bill from "old <persName>Mr. Samll Hauley</persName>," who, he explained, owed him £5 and sent the money by <persName>Jonathan Stiles</persName> to <persName>Francis Stiles</persName>, who delivered it to him (<persName>Munn</persName>). He intended, in case he could not pass the bill in <placeName>Milford</placeName>, to destroy or burn it. Finally, however, he confessed that he had bought the bill for 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a stranger from Long Island at <persName>Mr. Richard Bryant's</persName> house.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Munn</persName> was bound over to the next Superior Court to be held at <placeName>New Haven</placeName> on the second Tuesday in March but was released on bail provided by <persName>Daniel Munn</persName> and <persName>Ephraim Warner</persName>. His sureties brought him into court, where he was indicted for having on January 5 altered a 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>
                  <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and passed it to <persName>John</persName> Camp of <placeName>Milford</placeName>; also for having on January 7 altered a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill to £5 (<ref target="#fig-10">Plate VII</ref>) and passed it to <persName>Samuel Clark</persName>. The witnesses against him were Sergeant <persName>John Camp</persName>, Edward Elberton, mariner, Edward Wilkinson, <persName>Samuel Clark</persName>, <persName>John Stone</persName> and <persName>Gamaliel Prime</persName>. He pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months and to pay a fine of £45. The informer against him was granted the reward of £20 established by law.<ref target="#CH3-n4">

               <p>
                  <persName>Barker</persName>, doubtless encouraged by his escape, continued his career of crime but on November 15, 1717, made the mistake of passing a counterfeit 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> to Captain <persName>John Raymond, Jr.</persName>, in <placeName>Norwalk</placeName>. <persName>Raymond</persName> quickly detected the cheat and sent his son
<pb n="13"/>
after <persName>Barker</persName>, while he himself hastened to make a complaint to <persName>Major Peter Burr, J.P.</persName>, of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The suspected counterfeiter was soon seized and, when he was searched, two more false 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills were found on him, as well as three 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills, a half crown <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill, three 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Boston</placeName> bills, one 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill and one 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one is. <placeName>Boston</placeName> bill. At his examination before <persName>Major Burr</persName>on November 16 he said that he was from <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, where he had a father and brothers. He had, he admitted, been in jail in <placeName>New York</placeName> and his father had sent £70 there to redeem him. About five years before, he confessed, he had escaped from the jail in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> in order to save his life, as he was like to freeze to death. He added that he had not been to <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> for thirteen months and that he came last from the Widow Mead's at Horseneck on <placeName>Long Island</placeName>. As for the counterfeit bills, he claimed that he had received two of the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills from <persName>Charles Congrove</persName> at the <placeName>Oyster Pond</placeName> on <placeName>Long Island</placeName> and that he had changed silver with a <placeName>Hartford</placeName> man for two 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills. He planned, he said, to obtain money from his father to buy land for a settlement in the "New Country."</p>
               <p>Justice <persName>Burr</persName> was not favorably impressed, especially when a bill, not quite finished, was found in <persName>Barker's</persName> pocket, so he ordered the prisoner committed to the jail in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>. On the night of November 20, however, <persName>Barker</persName> broke out but this time was recaptured and returned to prison on November 23 by <persName>John Bagly</persName> and Lieutenant <persName>John Taylor</persName>. Now he was confined in irons.</p>
               <p>At the Superior Court held in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> on December 11, 1717, <persName>Barker</persName>, described as late of Newport, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, was indicted for having, about November 15 at Norwalk, counterfeited four 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills and for having uttered one of them. He pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and at the next sessions of the court on February 5, 1718, was sentenced forthwith to be given thirty lashes on the naked body and again, during the first week in March, to receive another thirty stripes. In addition he was to be imprisoned for six months and to pay costs of £14/0/4. The informer had some
<pb n="14"/>
difficulty in obtaining his reward, as well as his 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the treble damages due him by law. He therefore memorialized the Assembly in May, 1718, and was granted the reward of £20.<ref target="#CH3-n5">

In the latter part of November, 1711, he had altered three <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills, one of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one of 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The first he passed to <persName>Thomas Atwell</persName> in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, the second to Sergeant <persName>Strickland</persName> and the third to <persName>Richard Christophers</persName>. <persName>Christophers</persName> at once detected the cheat and bound <persName>Rowly</persName> over to appear at the next Superior Court. <persName>Shubael Rowly, Sr.</persName>, and <persName>Joshua Hempstead</persName> provided bail in the amount of £40. The following day, according to Christophers, young <persName>Rowly</persName> confessed that he had altered the bills and had passed two of them, of which he had taken up one and was desirous of taking up the other.</p>
               <p>At the March session of the Superior Court <persName>Rowly</persName> was called three times but neither he nor his sureties appeared. He was, however, indicted, his bail was declared forfeited, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Sometime later, probably in September, <persName>John Reed</persName>, the Queen's Attorney, recovered from <persName>Shubael Rowly, Sr.</persName>, £36 of the forfeited bond and, apparently because of a deal between Read and the father of young <persName>Rowly</persName>, the Assembly in October, 1712, was persuaded to pass a resolution that <persName>Shubael Rowly, Jr.</persName>, should not be further prosecuted on his indictment. As <persName>Christophers</persName> pointed out, the Assembly seems to have considered the answering of the bond as equivalent to the miscreant's conviction. <persName>Christophers</persName> was, as the informer, entitled to the reward of £20, which the Court advised him

               <p>About the beginning of March, 1713, <persName>Timothy Parkhurst</persName> of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName> was brought before Justice <persName>Williams</persName> of that town on suspicion of counterfeiting bills of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and passing. When the prisoner was on his way to jail, he fled from the constable and made good his escape. The governor and council, meeting in <placeName>New London</placeName> on March 4, ordered that a proclamation be published offering a reward and reasonable charges to anyone who should take the fugitive and bring him before any justice of the peace in the colony.<ref target="#CH3-n9">

He therefore petitioned the Assembly at its May session, 1714, for the abatement of his imprisonment, and his request was granted on the same terms stipulated with regard to <persName>Elderkin</persName>. Hence his term in jail could commence when the prison and weather entailed no hazard to his health. In his case, however, there was a proviso that he must pay the fine and costs before he could be released.<ref target="#CH3-n11">

               <p>The altering of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills from a lower to a higher denomination "by some evil persons" and the "considerable damages" suffered on that account by various individuals caused the Assembly in May, 1713, to vote that £20,000 in bills be emitted and used by the treasurer for one and a half years after May 14, 1713, to redeem the bills outstanding, holders of which were to be notified by proclamation to bring them to the treasurer to be exchanged.<ref target="#CH3-n12">

action of the Assembly, the governor and council at a meeting in <placeName>New London</placeName> on June 11.1713, ordered that the plates formerly used for printing bills should be altered "for the preventing of such cheating practises" and that the following devices should be put on the plates: on the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dove, on the 2/6 a cock, on the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a squirrel, on the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a fox, on the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a lamb, on the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a deer, on the 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a horse and on the £5 a lion.<ref target="#CH3-n13">

               <p>Almost a year later, at a meeting held in <placeName>New London</placeName> on June 2, 1714, the governor and council had further cause for concern. <persName>Richard Christophers</persName> laid before them a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of the first emission of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> which bore the date of July 12, 1709, only and not the additional date of May, 1713, "over the names of the committee signing, as in all the late emitted bills." The bill in question was examined and, on comparison with a true bill, was found to be taken from a false plate, as was shown by the bad cut and unevenness of the letters making up the body of the counterfeit bill. The council at once resolved that a proclamation be issued signifying the cheat and instructing all holders of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills of the first emission to take them to the treasurer and have them exchanged by him for bills of the same value of those lately emitted.<ref target="#CH3-n14">

               <p>Even the treasurer, <persName>Captain Joseph Whiting</persName>, had been deceived by some counterfeit bills, for <persName>William Pitkin</persName> and <persName>Joseph Talcott</persName>, a committee for drawing out of the treasury and destroying the dead stock of bills that had been drawn in by the constables in several rates, in June, 1714, came upon six 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills altered to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., five half crown (2/6) bills altered to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and four 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills also altered to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. On June 26 they likewise drew out of the hands of <persName>Mrs. Mary Haynes</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName> £975/3/-, in which sum they discovered two counterfeit 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi> bills.<ref target="#CH3-n15">

               </p>
               <p>The situation in 1717 was serious enough to warrant action by the Assembly. This body, by an act of October, 1714, had extended to
<pb n="18"/>
June 1, 1715, the time for exchanging bills of the emission of 1709. It now, in October, 1717, extended the time for exchange to May 15, 1718, after which date it was provided that the bills need not be accepted by creditors. In taking such action the Assembly noted that some persons had been negligent about bringing in the bills to have them exchanged by the treasurer, whereby opportunity had been given to evil-minded persons to practice cheats and forgeries by means of false plates and otherwise, all of which had proved and might still prove to be of great damage.<ref target="#CH3-n16">

               </p>
               <p>In May of 1717 the Assembly had also passed an act "for the more Effectual preventing the Spreading or Passing of False, Altered, or Counterfeited Bills of Credit." The preamble read: "This Assembly considering the great Mischief Suffered both by the Publick and by particular Persons, by reason of the many Altered, False and Counterfeit Bills that are Passing among the People, notwithstanding the great Care which has been taken to Suppress all Evil Practices upon the said Bills." Then the text continues:
<q>It is further Provided by this Assembly, and the Authority thereof, That when and so often as it shall happen, that any such False, Altered or Counterfeit Bills, shall be brought to the Treasurer of this Colony, or Offered to him in Payment of Rates, or to be Exchanged, he shall Secure them; and he is hereby Authorized to Seize and Retain them, entering the Name of the person in whose Possession the Bill or Bills were, on the Backside thereof.</q>

                  </ref> be transmitted to Coll. Fitch at <placeName>Boston</placeName>, for a pattern to distinguish those bills from the true bills in exchanging the two hundred and fifty pounds committed to his care for that end." Colonel Fitch was also to be sent very

detailed information about the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> paper money and likewise six bills of different denominations: a true 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of some of the former emissions; a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill from a counterfeit plate, which plate had never been found, while the counterfeits from it had not been known to be uttered for a considerable time; a true 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of the former emissions; it had a character on its face by which the false 10<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> bill from <persName>Greenman's</persName> plate could easily be distinguished, as the counterfeit was of a paler ink than the true bill (It was pointed out that no counterfeits of any <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills by false plates had been discovered save these two, the 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill and the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill struck from <persName>Greenman's</persName> plate.); a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill from <persName>Greenman's</persName> plate; a 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill raised to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill altered to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The memorandum to Colonel Fitch read: "There has been no late practice of this kind taken notice of here, nor anything of this nature attempted upon the bills of the later emission, which have the forms of living creatures on them."<ref target="#CH3-n21">

               </p>
               <p>Two <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> men involved in passing <persName>Greenman's</persName> paper money were <persName>Thomas Banks</persName> and <persName>John Andrews</persName> (or <persName>Andross</persName>). <persName>Banks</persName>, who was a tailor of <placeName>Branford</placeName>, got into difficulties through carelessness. On Saturday, July 6, 1717, he lodged at the house of <persName>John Hill</persName> and early in the morning set out for <placeName>Stonington</placeName>. After his departure <persName>Hill's</persName> eleven-year-old daughter picked up a piece of paper that <persName>Banks</persName> had dropped and brought it to her father. It was a letter dated June 21, 1717, and signed by <persName>John Lovel</persName>. Inside was a counterfeit 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill which was neither numbered nor signed (<ref target="#fig-12">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> IX</ref>-<ref target="#fig-13">X</ref>). Lovel was a tailor, a servant for debt to a tailor in <placeName>New London</placeName> named <persName>Farrand</persName>, from whom he ran away, presumably a short time before or after <persName>Banks</persName> dropped the note. In the note Lovel asked his wife for eight or nine pounds, with which he wanted to pay <persName>Mr. Thomas Farrand</persName> in order that he might be released and come to join his wife and child.</p>
               <p>On Thursday, July 11, <persName>John Austin</persName> and a fellow traveller named Aply stopped on their way from <placeName>New London</placeName> at Justice <persName>Hill's</persName> "in Naragansett country." <persName>Hill</persName> was not at home but his wife showed them
<pb n="21"/>
the counterfeit bill dropped by <persName>Banks</persName>. The following Saturday, on his way back to <placeName>New London</placeName>, <persName>Austin</persName> again stopped at <persName>Hill's</persName> and Justice <persName>Hill</persName> gave him the spurious bill to be sent to <persName>William Pitkin</persName>. <persName>Austin</persName> reported to <persName>Pitkin</persName> that people said <persName>Banks</persName> "was very great with one <persName>Leepincutts</persName> Wife who is now att <placeName>New London</placeName>, She is ye Woman ytt was accus'd, &amp; imprison'd att <placeName>Rhoad Island</placeName> for counterfeiting Bills." One <persName>Meergratt</persName>, keeper of a coffee house in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, told <persName>Austin</persName> that he and his wife suspected <persName>Banks</persName> of being "naughty" and that <persName>Banks</persName> had been in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> to get a sloop built.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Banks</persName> was soon arrested and on July 20 was examined at <placeName>Branford</placeName> before <persName>William Pitkin</persName>, assistant, and two justices of the peace, <persName>Edward Barker</persName> and <persName>John Hall</persName>. The prisoner said he had come to <placeName>Branford</placeName> about three years before, admitted dealings with the <persName>Lippencotts</persName> but claimed he had received only an insignificant sum from them for keeping <persName>Mrs. Lippencott</persName> at his house. Then he recounted in some detail a trip he had made to <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> about three weeks before, with special explanation of his finances on the journey.</p>
               <p>At the October sessions of the Superior Court at <placeName>New Haven</placeName> he was indicted for having, about July 8 at <placeName>Groton</placeName>, passed a false 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill to <persName>Mrs. Savell Latham</persName>, widow of <persName>Samuel Latham</persName>. His indictment, however, was returned ignoramus by the grand jury.</p>
               <p>Further information on <persName>Bank's</persName> activities subsequently came to light through the arrest of <persName>John Andrews</persName> (or <persName>Andros</persName>) of <placeName>Milford</placeName>. A warrant for his apprehension was issued at <placeName>Milford</placeName> on August 9, 1718, by <persName>Samuel Eells</persName> and <persName>Jonathan Law</persName> to the constables of that town. One <persName>Jones</persName> at <placeName>Boston</placeName>, who confessed himself a member of the ring of counterfeiters, apparently stated that <persName>Andrews</persName> had secured plates from <persName>Banks</persName>. <persName>Andrews</persName> was taken into custody and on August 11 was examined before Justices <persName>Eells</persName> and <persName>Law</persName>. His press was found and he said that Banks, who owed him money, had sent him plates and told him to make bills with them. Instead, he maintained, he threw them into his well and never made any money with them. He was sent with an officer, and the plates were recovered from the well. <persName>Andrews</persName> was
<pb n="22"/>
then released on bail of £40, furnished by <persName>Samuel Baldwin</persName> and <persName>John Harpin</persName> of <placeName>Milford</placeName>, for his appearance at the next Superior Court to be held at <placeName>New Haven</placeName> in September.</p>
               <p>On September 9 he was indicted for having on the last day of May passed counterfeit bills of several <placeName>New England</placeName> colonies to the value of £29. At this he made a full confession, which was as follows: When he was once at the house of <persName>Samuel Miles</persName> in <placeName>Milford</placeName>, <persName>Thomas Banks</persName> showed him a letter he had received from <persName>Silas Greenman</persName> of <placeName>Kingstown</placeName>, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, in which <persName>Greenman</persName> wrote that he had a horse for sale for £20; <persName>Banks</persName> explained that by "horse" <persName>Greenman</persName> meant "paper money" and by "£20" that he would provide £100 in bills of his own making for £20 of good money. <persName>Andrews</persName> then agreed to a proposition made by <persName>Banks</persName> that they go shares in procuring and passing some counterfeits. In March, 1716, <persName>Banks</persName> went to <persName>Greenman</persName> for some money but came back empty-handed, since <persName>Greenman</persName> had no money made. <persName>Captain Greenman</persName>, however, promised to have some bills ready by May 8 and that one of his sons would then meet <persName>Banks</persName> between the <placeName>New London</placeName> ferry and <persName>Edward Dennison's</persName> at the bridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Banks</persName> and <persName>Andrews</persName> at the appointed time and place met <persName>Edward Greenman</persName>, who gave <persName>Banks</persName> only £40, explaining that his brother <persName>Silas</persName>, who signed the bills, had been chosen justice of the peace and was unwilling to sign any more. Later on <persName>Banks</persName> went in company with <persName>Jones</persName> to <persName>Captain Greenman's</persName> and brought back plates for making the following bills: £3 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>; 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3/6, 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Boston</placeName>. Soon after this <persName>Banks</persName> was arrested for passing false money. In October, <persName>Andrews</persName> said, <persName>Banks</persName> gave him the plates to keep and then went away with his family to <placeName>New York</placeName>, whence about the end of July <persName>Banks</persName> wrote asking <persName>Andrews</persName> to send the "things" to him to <placeName>New York</placeName>. <persName>Andrews</persName> himself had had £29 in bogus money from Banks, who, incidentally, told him that <persName>Mr. Lippencott</persName> had secured false money from <persName>Captain Greenman</persName>.</p>
               <p>The judges had promised to intercede in <persName>Andrews</persName>' favor because he made this confession and produced the plates. The court sentenced him to be imprisoned for six months and to pay a fine of £50 and
<pb n="23"/>
costs of £5/4/0. The governor and council on October 28, 1718, heard a petition from the counterfeiter and because of his confession of guilt ordered his release from the jail in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> on condition that he furnish to the jailer satisfactory security for the payment of £30 of his fine and costs of prosecution to the next Superior Court to be held in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n22">

               <p>When the Superior Court met at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> on September 3, 1717, it had the task of determining who had altered a 2/6 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill to 10/6. Three persons were involved, <persName>Lieutenant Richard Higgenbotham</persName>, <persName>Sergeant Richard Lockwood</persName> and <persName>Ann Lockwood</persName>, the wife of <persName>Gersham Lockwood, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>. <persName>Higgenbotham</persName> was cleared by proclamation and it was ordered that the charges of prosecution be paid out of the public treasury.<ref target="#CH3-n23">

                  <persName>Richard Lockwood</persName> gave bail for his appearance in the amount of £100 but did not come into court, sending a note to the effect that he was too ill to attend because of pains in his neck. His bond was declared forfeited, and a <hi rend="italic">scire facias</hi> was issued for his appearance before the next sessions in March. At that time he was brought into court, when his case was continued until September. He appeared then but his case was apparently dropped, and there is no further notice of it.<ref target="#CH3-n24">
                     <hi rend="sup">24</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ann Lockwood</persName> was the real culprit. It was revealed that about the beginning of July <persName>Mrs. Richard Higgenbotham</persName> went from Cos Cob with four pairs of stockings for <persName>Mrs. Lockwood</persName> to sell in <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>. While in <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>
                  <persName>Mrs. Higgenbotham</persName> sold two pairs of the stockings, one to <persName>Joseph Knap</persName> for Indian corn and another to <persName>Mr. Jessup</persName> for four shillings. She left the money and the remaining two pairs of stockings with <persName>Mrs. Lockwood</persName>. A few days later Lieutenant <persName>Richard Higgenbotham</persName> and his wife went to <persName>Ann Lockwood</persName> and gave her a
<pb n="24"/>
2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> bill and a 2/6 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill. She was to add this to the 4<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> she already had from them and was to purchase for them some wool. When <persName>Mrs. Lockwood</persName> looked at the <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> half crown bill, she remarked that it was a fair opportunity to change the 2 to a 10 because of a vacancy in the paper. At this <persName>Mr. Higgenbotham</persName> told her not to do so and she said that she would not.</p>
               <p>The temptation, however, proved too strong. She altered the bill and paid it out, together with three 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills, to <persName>Benjamin Hobby</persName> for nine and a quarter pounds of wool. But soon <persName>Hobby</persName> found that the altered bill would not pass and returned it to her. <persName>Ann</persName>, thoroughly frightened, on Saturday, July 13, took the altered bill to the <persName>Higgenbothams</persName>. She told them it was the way the apple tempted Mother <persName>Eve</persName> and that she would never do such a thing again. She talked with them for about an hour under a green tree, asking them to take back the bill and to stretch the truth by saying that they had the bill of a stranger. If they would do this, she promised them £20 and said they could live at one end of her house and have the use of her cows. Her husband knew of her crime and so did his brother Joseph, who had informed her that he had a good mind to knock her on the head because her husband was like to be ruined by her confounded tricks. Subsequently <persName>Gersham Lockwood</persName> begged <persName>Higgenbotham</persName> to burn the bill and to say nothing about <persName>Ann's</persName> confession.</p>
               <p>Eventually <persName>Ann</persName> was taken into custody by Constable <persName>Joshua Reynolds</persName>. In September she was indicted for having altered the bill, pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to stand in the pillory on three several lecture days or days of public meeting for a half hour each day. She was further to be disabled to give any evidence before any court, magistrate, or justice of the peace and was to pay costs of prosecution amounting to £6/13/6. On Saturday, September 7, she was discharged on bail provided by her husband on condition that she would appear at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> on the public days appointed by the Deputy Governor to receive such parts of her punishment as had not yet been executed.<ref target="#CH3-n25">

               <p>On January 12, 1719, <persName>Samuel Miles</persName> gave entertainment in his house at <placeName>Milford</placeName> to <persName>Benjamin Simpson</persName> of <placeName>Weston</placeName> and <persName>John Cole</persName> of <placeName>Wells</placeName>, and <persName>Simpson</persName> paid out to <persName>Miles</persName> a 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>. After their departure <persName>Miles</persName> discovered that the bill was counterfeit, secured a warrant for their arrest and during the night pursued them
<pb n="26"/>
to <placeName>Stratford</placeName>, where he seized them at the house of <persName>Mr. Burroughs</persName> and brought them before the authorities. Upon examination <persName>Simpson</persName> owned that he had passed the bill to <persName>Miles</persName> and said that he had obtained it, along with two other 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> bills, among the notes making up £6 paid him near <placeName>Groton</placeName> for a horse. He did not know who the purchaser was but thought him a sailor lately come from <placeName>England</placeName>. He could not tell what he had done with the other two bills and demanded to be searched. This was done, and no paper money was found on him. <persName>Cole</persName>, however, was also searched and on him was discovered a 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Boston</placeName> bill judged by all the spectators to be false. <persName>Cole</persName> said that the money was not his but <persName>Simpson's</persName>, to which <persName>Simpson</persName> agreed.</p>
               <p>It appeared that <persName>Simpson</persName> had offered one 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill to <persName>Mrs. Burroughs</persName>, who refused it, telling him it was false. Further <persName>Joseph Blackledge</persName> and several others testified that after <persName>Simpson's</persName> arrest they had seen a considerable number of bills in his hand and Blackledge had looked at several of them and handed them back to <persName>Simpson</persName>. When he was questioned about them, <persName>Simpson</persName> admitted that he had burned the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill he had offered to <persName>Mrs. Burroughs</persName> and he finally requested liberty to go look for the rest of the money, which, he said, he had dropped along the way.</p>
               <p>In company with the constable and <persName>Samuel Whitney</persName> he went back to <persName>Mr. Burroughs</persName>' house, where, behind the log, they found one 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill partly burnt, and, when <persName>Mrs. Burroughs</persName> swept the hearth, another 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill came to light. Then a careful search along the road produced a bundle of good bills amounting to fifty-nine shillings, wrapped up in paper and lying in the snow, as well as eleven 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> bills. Then one more 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill was located in the snow. <persName>Simpson</persName> admitted that the money was his and finally confessed that he had passed one 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill before coming to <placeName>Milford</placeName>. This was scrupled but accepted, so that he feared all the bills were false and therefore burnt some and dropped the others. He was then committed to prison to remain there until the next Superior Court met at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>, while Cole, who had readily answered the questions put
<pb n="27"/>
to him and had been fully cleared by <persName>Simpson</persName> of having owned any of the paper money, was released.<ref target="#CH3-n27">

               <p>When the Superior Court met at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> on March 3, 1719, the keeper of the jail, <persName>Samuel Hubwell</persName>, being ordered to produce the prisoner, "declared that the sd. Prisoner had broken Goal and made his Escape out at the Chimney as he apprehended." <placeName>Joseph Curtis</placeName> of <placeName>Stratford</placeName> in reporting by letter to the Honorable <persName>Nathan Gold, Esq.</persName>, in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>, commented that <persName>Simpson's</persName> escape was a "great pittee," since such escapes encouraged criminals. <persName>Miles</persName>, because of <persName>Simpson's</persName> flight, had lost the reward due to him as informer, so upon his petitioning the Assembly in October that body voted him the sum of £5.<ref target="#CH3-n28">

               </p>
               <p>The concern of the authorities over the steady circulation of false paper money is indicated by the action of the governor and council at a meeting held at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName> on December 4, 1718, when it was resolved that a proclamation should be made requiring all persons in authority who had secured any counterfeit bills to have them returned to the treasurer of the colony before a certain day in May that the General Assembly might decide what should be done with them.<ref target="#CH3-n29">

               <p>It is quite likely that <persName>Ebenezer Seamore</persName> was responsible for some of the counterfeits. He was arrested in 1718 on suspicion of altering and putting off paper notes. He retained as his attorney <persName>John Read</persName> of <placeName>Lone Town</placeName> and gave <persName>Read</persName> his promisory note for £20. <persName>Read</persName>, however, went off to <placeName>Springfield</placeName> and <persName>Seamore</persName> had to secure the services of another lawyer, As it transpired, <persName>Seamore</persName> was not brought to trial but was dismissed, though he had to pay <persName>Read</persName> the £20, much to his chagrin.<ref target="#CH3-n30">

               </head>
               <p>On December 3, 1718, a general council held in <placeName>Boston</placeName> appointed <persName>Samuel Partridge</persName>, <persName>John Pyncheon</persName>, <persName>Joseph Parsons</persName>, <persName>Samuel Porter</persName> and <persName>John Stoddard</persName> to serve as judges of a special court of Oyer and Terminer to be held at <placeName>Northampton</placeName> for <placeName>Hampshire County</placeName> on the third Tuesday in December for the trial of <persName>Ovid Rushbrook</persName> (or <persName>Rutchbrock</persName>) for counterfeiting the bills of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n1">

                  <persName>Rushbrook</persName> apparently escaped conviction but one of the judges, <persName>John Pyncheon, Jr.</persName>, writing from <placeName>Springfield</placeName> in March, 1720, said of <persName>Rushbrook</persName> that at his trial "it was Generally Thought by ye Court, and other persons, That he was Guilty of The Fact he was Charged with." Pyncheon added: "It is generally Concluded by ye People here in <placeName>Springfield</placeName>, That This Last year, he has very much Practiced, The Counterfeiting &amp; altering of Bills of Credit."<ref target="#CH4-n2">

               </p>
               <p>Before long <persName>Rushbrook</persName> transferred his activities to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, and on February 25, 1720, <persName>William Pitkin</persName>, assistant, having received information that <persName>Rushbrook</persName>, <persName>Joshua Booth</persName>, <persName>Benoney Blodget</persName>, <persName>Dr. Whipple</persName> and others were counterfeiting bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>, ordered the Sheriff of <placeName>Hartford</placeName> County to go to <placeName>Tolland</placeName> and arrest the abovementioned persons or any other individuals who might be found in <persName>Whipple's</persName> house. The sheriff was likewise commanded to search for false bills or instruments for making them and, if necessary, to break open any house, chest or other place in the course of his search. On February 29 Deputy Sheriff <persName>Thomas Spencer</persName> reported that he had
<pb n="29"/>
arrested <persName>Thomas</persName> and <persName>Abraham Whipple</persName>, <persName>Ovid Rushbrook</persName> and <persName>Benoney Blodget</persName> and had seized two copper plates found hidden in <persName>Thomas Whipple's</persName> house.<ref target="#CH4-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> The persons taken up were examined, and from their answers it appeared that visitors at <persName>Whipple's</persName> home of late had been <persName>William Cromey</persName> from <placeName>Coventry</placeName>, <persName>Benoney Blodget</persName> and <persName>Joshua Booth</persName>. <persName>Rushbrook</persName>, who had followed the clothing trade in <placeName>Springfield</placeName>, had come away from that town to avoid paying money upon a charge laid upon him and had been boarding at <persName>Whipple's</persName> for about a month. All the witnesses professed great ignorance about the provenance of the two copper plates, and, when they were questioned as to how a certain board came to be as black as it was, they professed that it was from powder for making a skyrocket. After the examination of the suspects, it was decided by <persName>Pitkin</persName>, <persName>Joseph Talcott</persName> and <persName>Aaron Cook, J. P.</persName>, that <persName>Thomas Whipple, Sr.</persName>, and <persName>Ovid Rushbrook</persName> should find surety in the amount of £20 each to appear at the Superior Court to be held at <placeName>Hartford</placeName> on the third Tuesday in March or otherwise be committed to jail. <persName>Samuel Whipple</persName> of <placeName>Groton</placeName> furnished the bail of £20 for <persName>Whipple</persName> but <persName>Rushbrook</persName> was locked up in jail. <persName>Whipple's</persName> sons, <persName>Thomas, Jr.</persName>, and<persName> Abraham</persName>, were discharged on payment of costs.</p>
               <p>Before the meeting of the court in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> considerable evidence was collected by Justice <persName>John Pyncheon</persName> in <placeName>Springfield</placeName> and sent to the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> authorities. <persName>David Ingersoll</persName> of <placeName>Springfield</placeName> testified that <persName>Rushbrook</persName> seemed to have money, slyly looking at it in his pocketbook and taking great care that no one should get a good look at it. <persName>Ebenezer Stebbins</persName>, who had worked together with <persName>Rushbrook</persName> much of the past winter, swore that <persName>Rushbrook</persName> was very remiss in his business yet seemed to have money from some source.</p>
               <p>Other witnesses before <persName>John Pyncheon</persName> gave more damaging details. <persName>Jonathan Merrick</persName> stated that <persName>Rushbrook</persName> had told him it was an easy thing to alter bills by taking pieces of small bills and grafting the pieces onto bigger bills. On one occasion he examined <persName>Rushbrook's</persName> pocketbook and found in it pieces of bills, some with the word "shillings" on them and some other words or figures. He took them to
<pb n="30"/>
                  <persName>Rushbrook</persName> and told him he thought he was engaged in altering bills with these pieces but <persName>Rushbrook</persName> made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Margaret Merrick</persName> testified that during the summer of 1719, when <persName>Rushbrook</persName> was boarding at the home of her father, Lieutenant <persName>John Merrick</persName>, <persName>Rushbrook</persName>, who owed her father fifteen pence, seeing her with a fifteenpenny bill, told her that if she would turn it over to him he would give her a half crown bill and thus pay his debt. This was done, and soon after, on entering the shop where <persName>Rushbrook</persName> worked, she saw behind his loom his open pocketbook. She took it up and saw in it the fifteenpenny bill, now raised to fifteen shillings, and she recognized the bill by a particular mark which she had observed on the note which she had given to <persName>Rushbrook</persName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Robert Carton</persName> gave evidence that the night before <persName>Rushbrook</persName> left <placeName>Springfield</placeName> in company with <persName>Thomas Whipple</persName> the two men were at Ingersoll's, where they called for a private room and a fire. Carton, who was waiting on them, observed to <persName>Rushbrook</persName>, when <persName>Whipple</persName> had stepped out, that "they were about Roguery." <persName>Rushbrook</persName> said that he would like to secure three shilling and half crown <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills if the house had any. Later, on passing through the chamber, Carton heard <persName>Rushbrook</persName> tell <persName>Whipple</persName> he, could make <placeName>New York</placeName> money easily.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Mary Day</persName>, wife of Lieutenant <persName>John Day</persName> of <placeName>Springfield</placeName>, stated under oath that one evening <persName>Rushbrook</persName> and <persName>Jonathan Old</persName> were at their house whispering together. Old asked her for a light that they might go aside into another room, a request which she refused. The next morning Old came asking after his pocketbook, which he said he had lost the night before. This same pocketbook was found by <persName>Henry Rogers</persName> of <placeName>Springfield</placeName>, who brought it to Justice <persName>Pyncheon</persName> and told him that papers in it indicated that the owner was <persName>Jonathan Old</persName>. In the purse were also two counterfeit 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<ref target="#fig-14">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI</ref>) <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills. <persName>Pyncheon</persName> kept the matter secret until he received a message from Justice <persName>Wolcott</persName> of <placeName>Windsor</placeName> asking for information about <persName>Rushbrook</persName>. Old was then summoned and examined, first by <persName>Pyncheon</persName> and later by <persName>Pyncheon</persName> and <persName>Major Stoddard</persName> together. After many
<pb n="31"/>
shiftings and evasions Old admitted receiving the two forged bills from <persName>Rushbrook</persName> and that <persName>Rushbrook</persName> later begged him to keep silent about the loss of the pocketbook lest <persName>Rushbrook</persName> get into trouble on account of the bills. <persName>Pyncheon</persName> had Old sign an acknowledgment on the back of each bill that he had received it from Rushbrook. The justice then sent the money to the judges of the Superior Court in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, where one of the bills in question is still preserved in the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> State Library.</p>
               <p>In <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> new evidence against <persName>Rushbrook</persName> came to light, for it was discovered that he had passed to <persName>Joseph Hatch</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName> a fifteenpenny <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> bill altered to three pounds (<ref target="#fig-15">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII</ref>), a bill which <persName>Hatch</persName> had passed to Widow <persName>Abigail Baker</persName> of <placeName>Windsor</placeName>, who discovered the cheat and brought the matter to the attention of Justice Aaron Cook.</p>
               <p>On May 20, 1720, <persName>Thomas Whipple</persName> was indicted for having prepared, together with <persName>Rushbrook</persName>, copper plates for counterfeiting the bills of the colonies in <placeName>New England</placeName>. On the twenty-sixth of the same month <persName>Rushbrook</persName> was indicted for counterfeiting bills, making copper plates for such purpose and for passing counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>A report reached <persName>Rushbrook</persName> in prison that his trial was to be put off to a later session, whereupon he petitioned the judges, asking for a prompt trial along with <persName>Dr. Whipple</persName> and closing with these words: "I remain in a friendless and Moneyless, and almost in an Lunitick Condition thinking what will Become of me who Sprung of so Noble a stock." The trials of both men, however, did not take place, for <persName>Peter Pratt</persName>, the King's Attorney, stated that at the moment certain witnesses could not be had and therefore moved that the trials be deferred until the witnesses might be procured. As <persName>Rushbrook</persName> escaped and there is no record of a trial of Whipple, it is probable that <persName>Whipple's</persName> case was dropped.<ref target="#CH4-n4">

               </p>
               <p>In May, 1720, a law was passed to the following effect:</p>
               <pb n="32"/>
               <p>Whosoever shall Stamp, or any other ways Counterfeit any of the several sorts of Coin, mentioned in a certain Law, Entituled, <hi rend="italic">An Act for Ascertaining the Value of Coins Currant within this Colony</hi>; or any other Species or sort of Coin; or that shall Utter or put off any such Counterfeit Coin, knowing it to be Base, False and Counterfeit; and shall be thereof Convicted before any of the Superiour Courts in this Colony, shall be Sentenced to suffer Six Months Imprisonment, or such other Fine or Corporal Punishment (respect being had to the degree of the Crime) as the said Court shall judge meet or inflict: Such Fines to be to the Publick Treasury of this Colony.<ref target="#CH4-n5">

               </p>
               <p>It may be presumed that there was some suspicion that counterfeit coin was being made or uttered, though the extant records give no evidence on the point.</p>
               <p>By September it was discovered that the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> were being forged. <persName>Samuel Shute</persName>, Governor of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, on September 5, 1720, issued the following procamation:
<q>Whereas notwithstanding the Care of this Government to prevent and punish the Counterfeiting and Falsifying the Bills of Credit, (more especially of this Province,) a Discovery has been lately made of a considerable number of Forged and Counterfeit Bills, in Imitation of the Five Pound Bills of this Province, Signed by Four Hands; and others in Imitation of the Ten Shilling Bills of the Colony of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>; Which Counterfeit Bills have been Uttered by One <persName>John Bishop</persName> of <placeName>Guilford</placeName> (as he calls himself) who is supposed to be the Forger and Counterfeiter thereof, and to have been assisted by one <persName>Joshua Booth</persName> of Enfield, and one William Tucker:</q>

                  <persName>John Bishop</persName>, alias <persName>John Blyn</persName>, had been arrested at <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> on September 2 and taken before the authorities.

               <p>It was probably the activity of <persName>Bishop</persName> and his associates which on November 2, 1720, prompted Governor Shute of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> to say in a speech to the General Assembly of that province:
<q>The Vile practice of Counterfeiting the Province Bills, is carrying on not only in many parts of these Provinces; but also in Great Britain, which if not timely prevented must prove very fatal to most of the American Settlements, whose Medium of Trade are Bills of Credit, I therefore recommend it to you, as one of the best Expedients to prevent the growth of this wicked Practice, to make it a Capital Crime by a Law, and strictly to put it in Execution, without which, making of good &amp; wholsome Laws, will be of no signification, and instead of tending to strengthen the hands of Government, which is the principal design of making them, will rather render the Government weak and feeble.<ref target="#CH4-n10">

and bring him before <persName>Pitkin</persName> in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> at eight o'clock on the morning of August 6. <persName>Zebulon Taylor</persName> and <persName>Samuel Piney, Jr.</persName>, both of <placeName>Windsor</placeName>, were also summoned to give evidence against <persName>Drake</persName> for having sometime in April passed a counterfeit dollar to <persName>John Smith</persName> of <placeName>Windsor</placeName>. On August 6 <persName>Pitkin</persName> adjourned the court to Monday, August 13, when <persName>Drake</persName> appeared and was questioned.

               <p>
                  <persName>Taylor</persName> and <persName>Piney</persName> testified that once in the house in <placeName>Windsor</placeName> where <persName>Jonathan Day</persName> lived they heard <persName>Smith</persName> speak to <persName>Drake</persName> "about his puting off false Dolers or false Money." At this time <persName>Drake</persName> pulled out a piece in the shape of a dollar, which <persName>Smith</persName> said that <persName>Drake</persName> dare not pass. <persName>Drake</persName> affirmed that he did and offered to let <persName>Smith</persName> have it for five shillings and claimed that it was good money.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Pitkin</persName> thought the evidence against <persName>Drake</persName> so strong that he required his appearance at the next Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> on the second Tuesday in September.

               <p>Another counterfeiter of this period was <persName>Mary Peck Butterworth</persName> of <placeName>Rehoboth</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, who as early as 1716 was forging paper money of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>.

He confessed that he had uttered about £50 in false <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> £5 bills made by <persName>Mrs. Butterworth</persName>, and one of her products may well be the counterfeit <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> £5 bill, dated 1713, now in the possession of the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Historical Society in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n15">

               <p>The <placeName>New England</placeName> governments had good reason to be alarmed by the activities of <persName>Mrs. Butterworth</persName> and others. Governor Dummer of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> on August 9, 1723, issued a proclamation designed to protect not only the bills of his province but also those of the other colonies in <placeName>New England</placeName>. It read:
<q>Whereas notwithstanding the Care taken by the several Governments to secure their Bills of Credit from Forgery and Corruption, by ordaining such Punishments as were thought sufficient to deter all Persons from that wicked and villanous Practice, and altho' the same by a late Law of this Province is to be punished by Death; And notwithstanding the former Examples of Justice inflicted on such Offenders, Divers Persons have of late been so bold and hardy as to Counterfeit the Bills of this and the Neighbouring Governments; more especially the Five Pound and Thirty

               <p>Not much later, on October 25, 1723, <persName>Daniel Tuttle</persName> of <persName>Wallingford</persName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, yeoman, was arrested and examined in <placeName>Boston</placeName> concerning his passing to Elizabeth Ellis a false £5 bill of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>. He claimed that Francis Brown of <placeName>New Haven</placeName> had given it to him some ten days before and had asked him to purchase handkerchiefs with it in <placeName>Boston</placeName>. During the examination he tried to chew up a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill, which he managed to reduce to pulp before it was taken from his mouth. Three days later he was further examined by Justice Habijah Savage and he told how <persName>Ebenezer Seamore</persName> that summer had brought back £5 and 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> from the Jerseys and had later
<pb n="39"/>
showed him, <persName>Tuttle</persName>, plates for making them which had been engraved by <persName>Rushbrook</persName>. <persName>Tuttle</persName> had kept the plates for <persName>Seamore</persName> under straw in his barn. On November 9 <persName>Tuttle</persName> petitioned Governor Dummer and his council to be permitted to give information against <persName>Seamore</persName>. <persName>Tuttle</persName> was tried in <placeName>Boston</placeName> on December 13, 1723, and was acquitted, for the jury decided that his putting the bill in the hands of <persName>Elizabeth Ellis</persName> was not "uttering" it.<ref target="#CH4-n17">

               </p>
               <p>By the end of December <persName>Tuttle</persName> was back in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> giving evidence against <persName>Seamore</persName> and his associates. <persName>Seamore</persName> was taken up at <persName>Wallingford</persName>, sent to <placeName>Hartford</placeName> and, after his examination on November 3, 1723, was committed to jail. The next day <persName>John Wyard</persName> (or <persName>Wiard</persName>) of <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName> was examined by <persName>Joseph Talcott</persName>, assistant, who also at that time questioned <persName>James Poisson</persName> (or <persName>Piso</persName>n). <persName>Wyard</persName> was arrested and examined again on November 6, 7 and 13. He had put off false bills, obtained from <persName>Seamore</persName>, in <placeName>Waterbury</placeName> and in <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>. At <persName>Seamore's</persName> request he later sent <persName>John Hurlbut</persName> to get back the bills uttered in <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>. At his first examination he admitted having gone to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> with <persName>Seamore</persName> and mentioned <persName>Seamore's</persName> having made a trip to <placeName>Egg Harbor</placeName> in the Jerseys, but he confessed to nothing damaging either to himself or to <persName>Seamore</persName>. On November 6, however, when he was offered a reward of £20 and promised that all possible favor would be shown him if he could apprehend the principal actor and bring about the seizure of the press, he hesitated but said he was as capable as anyone of being King's Evidence in the matter. His further examination was then postponed until the seventh, when he was released in bail of £200. On that day he was closely questioned about a bill he had passed and was finally released again on bail of £250. At his final examination on November 13 <persName>Wyard</persName> admitted that he had been together with <persName>Seamore</persName> and <persName>Daniel</persName>
                  <persName>Tuttle</persName> in <persName>Wallingford</persName>, and, with respect to a £5 bill he had passed, he explained that he had originally received the money from <persName>James Poisson</persName> and later got him to take it back. Still, however, he revealed nothing dangerous to himself or <persName>Seamore</persName>.</p>
               <pb n="40"/>
               <p>
                  <persName>James Poisson</persName>, who was examined on November 4, told quite a different story. <persName>Wyard</persName>, according to <persName>Poisson</persName>, brought him a <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> £5 bill which <persName>Wyard</persName> had passed to <persName>Hezekiah May</persName> and <persName>May</persName> had returned. <persName>Poisson</persName> inspected it, declared it to be false and tore it to pieces, acting thus as a friend to <persName>Wyard</persName> to keep him out of trouble. <persName>May</persName> confirmed the fact the <persName>Wyard</persName> had given him a counterfeit bill, which he had returned, and <persName>Elnathan Strong</persName> told also of receiving a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill from <persName>Wyard</persName> which proved to be forged and which <persName>Wyard</persName> took back. In like fashion <persName>John Hurlbut</persName> and <persName>Ensign Curtis</persName> had received false <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> paper money from Wyard.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Daniel Tuttle</persName>, who was back in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> on December 31, was apparently quite willing to talk freely and told what is probably the true story, which is as follows: in the spring of 1723 he was hired by <persName>Seamore</persName> to pilot him through the woods to <placeName>Guilford</placeName>, where <persName>Seamore</persName> said he was going to get <persName>John Blyn</persName>, the same man who had been formerly prosecuted for making money. <persName>Seamore</persName> planned to send <persName>Blyn</persName> to get <persName>Ovid Rushbrook</persName> to go with him, <persName>Seamore</persName>, to the Jerseys to make plates and money. A short time later <persName>Seamore</persName> informed <persName>Tuttle</persName> that <persName>Blyn</persName> would not go to <persName>Rushbrook</persName> and that <persName>Rushbrook</persName> would not be concerned with <persName>Blyn</persName> because <persName>Blyn</persName> had once before betrayed him. So <persName>Seamore</persName> went himself to <persName>Rushbrook</persName> in <placeName>Springfield</placeName>. <persName>Rushbrook</persName> promised to meet him soon in <persName>Wallingford</persName> and presently came there. At the end of May or beginning of June, 1723, <persName>Seamore</persName>, <persName>Rushbrook</persName> and one Robinson of <persName>Wallingford</persName> set out for the Jerseys. On the way, as <persName>Seamore</persName> said, he bought "half a pint of Lincott oyl att <persName>Mr. Jeremiah Attwaters</persName> in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> to do the flourishes of the bills on the back sid."</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Seamore</persName>, on his return to <persName>Wallingford</persName> about June 12 or 14, told <persName>Tuttle</persName> that they had made a £5 plate of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and had struck from it six or eight bills which he thought would pass. They had made the money "near Thirty miles from any place," cutting a hole in a hollow tree and putting in a pry to press the bills. One or two of the notes had been passed off at <placeName>Egg Harbor</placeName> to a man named Risley from <persName>Wallingford</persName>, who later returned the bills to <persName>Seamore</persName>. <persName>Rushbrook</persName> and
<pb n="41"/>
                  <persName>Seamore</persName> together made another trip to the Jerseys about the beginning of July.</p>
               <p>On the second trip they made more money, of which <persName>Seamore</persName> passed one bill at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> and another at <placeName>Danbury</placeName>. <persName>Seamore</persName> stated to <persName>Tuttle</persName> that every time he came up from the Jerseys, <persName>John Wyard</persName> got part of the bogus money; <persName>Wyard</persName>, sometime in August, accompanied <persName>Seamore</persName> to the Jerseys, where <persName>Rushbrook</persName> made a plate for the 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill and <persName>Wyard</persName> had a press made. <persName>Seamore</persName> returned to <placeName>Wallingford</placeName> alone, while <persName>Wyard</persName>, coming later, brought with him fifty £5 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> counterfeits and fifty 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of that province made from the new plate; he left both plates and half of the bills with <persName>Seamore</persName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Seamore</persName> gave <persName>Tuttle</persName> a number of the false bills and on the Sunday night after <persName>Wyard's</persName> return asked <persName>Tuttle</persName> to keep the plates in a chest under lock and key. <persName>Tuttle</persName> took them but hid them in his haymow, where they were found later when a search was made for them. <persName>Seamore</persName>, as he told <persName>Tuttle</persName>, put off a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill to <persName>Ensign Nathaniel Roy</persName>, another to <persName>John Ives, Jr.</persName>, and a £5 bill to a person whose first name was <persName>Jeremiah</persName>, all inhabitants of <persName>
                     <placeName>Wallingford</placeName>
                  </persName>. On a trip to <placeName>Boston</placeName> and <placeName>Salem</placeName>
                  <persName>Seamore</persName> had put off some £60 in counterfeit bills, one of which was passed to a <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName> of <placeName>Boston</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Evidence secured by the authorities from <persName>John Blyn</persName> largely confirmed <persName>Tuttle's</persName> account. <persName>Blyn</persName>, moreover, added a number of details: <persName>Seamore</persName> and <persName>Wyard</persName> promised <persName>Rushbrook</persName> a horse and clothing for his services and <persName>Seamore</persName> gave <persName>Rushbrook</persName> a watch and £4 in <placeName>New York</placeName> money to encourage him. Despite this <persName>Rushbrook</persName> gave him the slip and afterwards, when <persName>Seamore</persName> had been arrested and broken jail and escaped, he told <persName>Tuttle</persName> that when he (<persName>Seamore</persName>) and <persName>Wyard</persName> were in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> they heard that <persName>Rushbrook</persName> was also there. They went to the house where he was said to be staying but the residents denied that he was there, so the two men went away. Coming again a half day later, they entered and saw <persName>Rushbrook</persName> run upstairs, so they followed him and asked him why he had taken their money and then left them in the lurch. He maintained that he was afraid but they
<pb n="42"/>
finally won him over and he made the two plates for them. <persName>Tuttle</persName> added that <persName>Seamore</persName> had offered him his expenses and a horse if he would go down to <persName>Rushbrook</persName> and get more plates but <persName>Tuttle</persName> refused to have anything to do with the business.</p>
               <p>As a result of the investigations <persName>Wyard</persName> was indicted in March, 1724, for uttering a false bill, and <persName>James Poisson</persName>, shopkeeper, was presented by the grand jury in September of the same year, also for passing. Poisson, at an examination on March 30, 1724, when asked where and when he got the counterfeit £5 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill he had passed to Caleb Bull (<ref target="#fig-18">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV</ref>), replied that he had picked it up on the highway between <placeName>Hartford</placeName> and <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName> and that he had found in all nine £5 and seven 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> counterfeit bills, all wrapped up in a paper. When further pressed by the examining magistrates, he made it clear that <persName>John Wyard</persName>, who owed him money, had dropped it for him to pick up. The name of <persName>John Pierce</persName> had been written on the bill passed to Caleb Bull, and <persName>Poisson</persName> admitted he had written the name on the money in order to swear that he had the counterfeit from Pierce. <persName>Poisson</persName> said he suspected the bills because he did not believe <persName>Wyard</persName> had so much good money also and because the false bills were paler than true ones and because they looked so new. <persName>Poisson</persName>, at the conclusion of his examination, was released on bail of £200 provided by <persName>Jonathan Easton</persName> for his appearance at the September session of the Superior Court in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>.</p>
               <p>After his indictment he pleaded not guilty but was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months, to stand an hour and a half in the pillory at <placeName>Hartford</placeName> between the hours of ten and one on some day in November, to have the lower part of his right ear cut off and to pay costs of £9/10/–. When, however, he was called three times, he failed to appear, and the bond given by <persName>Easton</persName> was declared forfeited.<ref target="#CH4-n18">
                     <hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                  </ref>
                  <persName>Easton</persName> died soon after and the recognizance was sued out against his administratrix to final judgment. <persName>Peter Pratt</persName>, the King's Attorney, therefore, informed the Assembly in October, 1725, that <persName>Poisson</persName> was "like wholly to escape punishment for his flagitious crime,
<pb n="43"/>
and the innocent widow and fatherless made the only sufferers." The Assembly then had a warrant issued for the immediate arrest of <persName>Poisson</persName>, who was to have the sentence of the Superior Court against him executed unless he should pay the £200 and sheriff's costs before December 31, 1725.<ref target="#CH4-n19">
                     <hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                  </ref> The sum was evidently paid by <persName>Poisson</persName>, for in April of the next year thirty pounds of it, by direction of the governor and council, was ordered paid to Major <persName>Roger Wolcott</persName> for official business.<ref target="#CH4-n20">

After his absconding <persName>Poisson</persName> had been living unmolested in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, apparently with the full knowledge of the authorities.<ref target="#CH4-n21">

Bail for his appearance in the amount of £150 had been provided by <persName>Samuel Seamore</persName> (or <persName>Seymour</persName>), and when <persName>Ebenezer</persName> was thrice called and failed to appear, this bail was declared forfeited.<ref target="#CH4-n23">

He was called, appeared, pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months, to stand an hour and a half in the pillory near the court house in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> in November on some day between the hours of ten and one, to have the lower part of his right ear cut off and to pay costs of £9/6/6.<ref target="#CH4-n24">

               <p>The <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> authorities were alarmed by the counterfeiting which was being carried on, and the governor and council on February 20, 1724, ordered that a proclamation be issued "for the more effectual discovery and conviction of such as have been guilty of counterfeiting bills of credit, or of uttering them willingly, or of making any plates

               <p>It was natural, no doubt, that the colony should decide on more severe penalties as a deterrent to counterfeiters. In May, 1724, the following law was enacted:

               <p>In addition to <persName>Rushbrook</persName>, <persName>Seamore</persName>, <persName>Tuttle</persName>, <persName>Wyard</persName> and <persName>Poisson</persName>, others were suspected of counterfeiting at times. One such person was <persName>Ephraim Shevie</persName>, alias <persName>John Rideout</persName>, who was arrested by <persName>Benjamin</persName>
                  <pb n="46"/>
                  <persName>Judd</persName> on December 13 and taken, along with <persName>Thomas Stedman</persName> and <persName>Israel Scias</persName> (or <persName>Sias</persName>), who were with him, to <persName>Major Talcott</persName>, assistant. The three men were closely questioned by <persName>Talcott</persName>, who ordered Shevie to be confined in the <placeName>Hartford</placeName> jail.</p>
               <p>Shevie was by profession a maker of sundials, although he had also probably taught school and apparently felt qualified as a teacher. He had been acquainted with <persName>Dr. Whipple</persName> of <placeName>Tolland</placeName> and <persName>John Blyn</persName> and seemingly knew much about <persName>Rushbrook</persName>. At his examination he admitted that he had hidden his tools some thirty rods from his lodging but was full of excuses and lies and claimed that he had boasted that he would make a plate for counterfeiting only in jest.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Stedman</persName> and <persName>Scias</persName> told a different story, for <persName>Stedman</persName> said that <persName>Shevie</persName> had asked if he could have a private room at his house and had told <persName>Scias</persName> he would make the room into a mint room for making bills. Their account was that <persName>Shevie</persName> asked <persName>Stedman</persName> for a new 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill and claimed he would make a plate for it. He also wished <persName>Stedman</persName> to have ready for him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills. <persName>Shevie</persName> likewise had told them he had made a £5, a £3/10 and a £3 plate and had struck off bills from them, the best bills ever made, When asked to show the plates, he said they were in the woods some two miles away. He also promised he would make £300 in bills for <persName>Scias</persName> and asserted that the best place to finish his plates would be in the chamber of <persName>Joseph Butler</persName>.</p>
               <p>The authorities now began to question other persons thought to have knowledge of Shevie's money making, among whom was <persName>Abigail Conwell</persName> of <placeName>Middletown</placeName>. She seems to have interested <persName>Israel Scias</persName> in trying to benefit by <persName>Shevie's</persName> work and she declared that she had heard <persName>Shevie</persName> and <persName>Daniel Martin</persName> talking of making false money and that <persName>Shevie</persName> had affirmed he could make £1,000 of bills that would not be suspected.</p>
               <p>For some time <persName>Shevie</persName> had boarded at the home of <persName>Nathaniel</persName> and <persName>Hannah Barns</persName> in <placeName>Middletown</placeName>. Now Constable <persName>Thomas</persName> How of that place brought them before Justice <persName>Hamblin</persName> to be questioned. According to the <persName>Barns</persName>, <persName>Shevie</persName> boasted he could engrave a plate for making money if Barns would give him new bills. <persName>Barns</persName> did give him
<pb n="47"/>
a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill and presently <persName>Shevie</persName> produced a plate he had made to print such money and also showed another plate with flowers engraved on it. <persName>Barns</persName> took the plates away from <persName>Shevie's</persName> workshop and hid them under the roots of a tree, whereupon <persName>Shevie</persName> became angry and protested that the plates were worth £50. Once <persName>Shevie</persName> tried to persuade <persName>Barns</persName> to ride to <placeName>New York</placeName> to bring him supplies for making bills, "Indian black" and "Linset oyl." <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Barns</persName> admitted that they had passed off half of a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill to <persName>Captain Nols</persName>, the tailor, but, when he declared it false, they took it back. They explained that they got the half bill from <persName>Jonathan Prat</persName>, a shopkeeper in <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName>.</p>
               <p>At his examination on December 20 <persName>Shevie</persName> admitted he had engraved letters on a plate and also an escutcheon, but only to try his skill. Towards the end of the month, however, he sent the jailer to <persName>Talcott</persName> to say that he would make a confession. <persName>Talcott</persName>, accompanied by Justice <persName>Cook</persName>, went to the jail and <persName>Shevie</persName> told them that <persName>Nathaniel Barns</persName> induced him to make the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. plate, since <persName>Barns</persName> wanted to make money to redeem his mortgaged land. The bills came off blotched and <persName>Shevie</persName> burnt them, while <persName>Barns</persName> carried away the plate.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Shevie</persName> was most indiscreet, for at the house of <persName>Obadiah Allyn</persName> he "bragged" in the presence of <persName>Daniel Marcom</persName> to one Thankful <persName>Baker</persName> that he could make £5 bills and pulled some from his pocket. When the persons present said they would complain of him, he threw the bills in the fire. On another occasion, at the house of <persName>John Williams</persName> in <placeName>Middletown</placeName>, when <persName>Ebenezer</persName>
                  <persName>Hubbert</persName>, <persName>Joseph Starr</persName>, <persName>Williams</persName>, <persName>Ebenezer</persName>
                  <persName>Robind</persName> and <persName>Moses Bidwell</persName> were there, <persName>Shevie</persName> pulled out about £10 in bills and asked <persName>Williams</persName> if he could change a £5 bill, a £3 bill or one of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>At the next Superior Court in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in March, 1724, Shevie, formerly of <placeName>Middletown</placeName> but lately of <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName>, was indicted for having made a plate to print the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-19">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI</ref>). He was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned, to stand in the pillory and to have his right ear cropped. That same month,
<pb n="48"/>
writing in prison, he addressed a petition to the judges of the Superior Court. He pointed out that he had already spent sixteen or seventeen weeks in a dark, stinking and nasty jail, with only a little straw for a bed and with poor clothing on him. This was also in the winter, and his bodily health and mind had suffered. He requested that he be not maimed by cropping so as to be debarred from earning his daily bread in any honest employment of schooling or other labor. What town, he asked, would receive him as schoolmaster with a cropped ear? He begged to be released from payment of fines or costs and asked to be allowed to take an oath in secret never to counterfeit and also to act as an informer and agent to seek out counterfeiters and denounce them to the authorities.</p>
               <p>By May he had stood in the pillory and had been cropped. He then petitioned the Assembly, asking to be released and complaining that he now had no straw on which to lie, that he was always in iron chains, that it was bitterly cold and that there had been no fire in March and April. His old outer coat had not been off him at all, and, of late, he had received a short allowance of food, so that he suffered gripes within his body as well as anguish of mind. Perhaps <persName>Shevie</persName> exaggerated when he wrote of the prison fare, for <persName>James Henderson</persName>, keeper of the <placeName>Hartford</placeName> jail, said he spent seven shillings on <persName>Shevie</persName> for food and drink instead of the 2/6 allowed.<ref target="#CH4-n32">

               </p>
               <p>In September <persName>Shevie</persName> directed a last desperate appeal for mercy to the Assembly. He had been, he wrote, a prisoner in the <placeName>Hartford</placeName> jail for nearly eleven months in close confinement and all the time in iron chains; his suffering was more than tongue or pen could express; he had received his public punishment in May and since March had been given only bread and water, supplemented by a little food sent him by charitable persons; he had no bed to lie on; his breeches were nearly worn off him; his strength was weakened, his understanding was impaired and he was perplexed with vermin. This time the Assembly harkened to his prayer and ordered his release on condition that he leave the colony within one month and with the under-

standing that he be imprisoned again if he did not depart within that time or if he again came into the colony.<ref target="#CH4-n33">

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XVII</ref>-<ref target="#fig-21">XVIII</ref>) and now in the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> State Library, involved three persons, <persName>David Colver</persName> of Groton, <persName>John Stevens</persName> of <placeName>Windsor</placeName> and <persName>John Williams</persName> of <placeName>Stonington</placeName>, in considerable difficulty. The story of the bill would seem to be as follows: Stevens got it from one <persName>William Dyer</persName> in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, probably at <placeName>Kingstown</placeName>, where a <persName>Mr. Sheffield</persName> saw it and said he thought it might be false; about January 10, 1724, at the house of <persName>John Williams</persName>, <persName>Stevens</persName> offered the bill in payment of his reckoning to Desire <persName>Williams</persName>, wife of the landlord. She took it to her husband, who questioned it and offered to give 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. note. At once <persName>David Colver</persName>, who was present, took it off <persName>Williams</persName>' hands, giving him an additional five shillings for it, and then passed it later to <persName>Jonathan Colver</persName>. <persName>Jonathan</persName> discovered it was false, and, when <persName>David</persName> refused to take it back, he showed it to <persName>Nehemiah Smith, J.P.</persName>, who went with <persName>Jonathan</persName> to <persName>David</persName>. When <persName>David</persName> again refused to take it back, the justice of the peace took possession of it and it was shown to the treasurer of the colony and declared false.</p>
               <p>Warrants were issued for the arrest of <persName>David Colver</persName>, <persName>John Williams</persName> and <persName>John Stevens</persName>, all of whom were bound over to appear at the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>New London</placeName> in September. <persName>Colver</persName> was released on bail provided by himself, <persName>John Williams</persName> and <persName>Moses Fisk</persName> of <placeName>Groton</placeName>, while <persName>Stevens</persName> was freed on bail in the same amount provided by himself and <persName>John Dean</persName> of <placeName>Groton</placeName>; <persName>Williams</persName> also secured a bail bond in the amount of £150.</p>
               <p>Both <persName>Colver</persName> and <persName>Stevens</persName> were indicted at the September session of the Superior Court but the grand jury returned both indictments ignoramus and the prisoners were freed by proclamation upon payment of costs. <persName>Williams</persName> did not appear at the March session of the court in 1725 but his wife informed the judges that he was too ill to attend and he wrote the court a letter to that effect, so that his case was continued to September, when he was indicted, pleaded not guilty, was tried, acquitted and discharged on payment of costs.<ref target="#CH4-n42">

               <p>Information was lodged, presumably in 1725 or 1726, against a certain <persName>William Carrick</persName>, for making and passing counterfeit bills. The disposition of the case is not recorded but the informer, <persName>Joseph Dewèy</persName> of <placeName>Hebron</placeName>, asked and received from the Assembly in October, 1726, the sum of £4.<ref target="#CH4-n43">

               <p>Another affair of which the outcome is not recorded concerned a <persName>Dr. Holloway</persName>, who lived in <placeName>Pomfret</placeName> or <placeName>Killingly</placeName>.

            </head>
            <p>About the middle of June, 1730, <persName>Samuel Wood</persName>, a transient person, was arrested and brought before the county court in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, where he told the following story: he had come from <placeName>Esopus</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, together with <persName>Peter</persName> and <persName>John Levingston</persName> and one <placeName>Gardner</placeName> in a boat commanded by Captain <persName>John Knott</persName>; his business was to receive some money from <persName>Thomas Starr</persName> of <placeName>Middletown</placeName>, where in April he had passed a £3 <placeName>New York</placeName> bill to a <persName>Mr. Banks</persName>, who returned it to him; he then passed the same note to <persName>John Smith</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, who discovered it to be altered from 3/6 to £3 (<ref target="#fig-22">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIX</ref>); in April he had also uttered a £4 <placeName>New York</placeName> bill to <persName>William Hooker</persName>, who had returned it to him on the ground that it was altered; <persName>Wood</persName> asserted that he had received the £3 bill from a Palatine who lived about eighteen miles above <placeName>Esopus</placeName> and the £4 bill from <persName>John Person</persName> in <placeName>Esopus</placeName>. <persName>Wood</persName> was released on bail of £20 furnished by himself and <persName>John Biggelow</persName> jointly for his appearance at the next Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>.</p>
            <p>From the evidence of three persons who were questioned it became clear that <persName>Wood</persName> knew full well that both bills were altered before he uttered them. <persName>Thomas Colman</persName> testified that he saw the £4 bill before it was passed to <persName>Mr. Hooker</persName> and that he told <persName>Wood</persName> it was counterfeit, showing why this was so. Joseph Gilbert, Jr., on June 23 made oath that toward the end of April at <persName>Mr. Cook's</persName> in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>
               <persName>Sam Wood</persName> had showed him the same £4 bill, which he, <persName>Gilbert</persName>, declared to him had been altered from a 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a 4/6 bill to £4 and warned him against passing it. Wood, indeed, had agreed that it must be false and promised that he would not utter it. <persName>Captain Knott</persName> declared that <persName>Wood</persName> had asked him to change the £3 <placeName>New York</placeName> bill which <persName>Wood</persName> had later
<pb n="53"/>
paid <persName>Smith</persName>. <persName>Knott</persName> had refused and pointed out to <persName>Wood</persName> that the bill was altered, showing that the £ at the bottom of the bill was leaning the wrong way, that there was no £ sign to two three pounds at the bottom within the body of the bill and finally that he could not find "three pounds" where it should be mentioned in the body of the bill.<ref target="#CH5-n1">

            <p>At the Superior Court held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> on September 8, 1730, <persName>Wood</persName> was called three times but did not appear, so the bond provided by <persName>John Biggelow</persName> was declared forfeited.<ref target="#CH5-n2">

               </p>
               <p>Before long <persName>Abbott</persName> was heard of again, this time in the company of <persName>Joseph Waterhouse</persName> of <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>. About the middle of April, 1732, Waterhouse, who was master of a sloop lying near "Eles Neck," employed <persName>Thomas Monk</persName> and <persName>Samuel Suard</persName> to go to buy for him two quarts of rum, some pork and three pounds of sugar, to pay for which he gave <persName>Suard</persName> a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill. <persName>Suard</persName> turned the money over to <persName>Monk</persName>, who bought the sugar and rum from <persName>Hannah Hull</persName>, wife of <persName>Captain Josiah Hull</persName>, and gave the change to <persName>Suard</persName>, while <persName>Suard</persName> handed it over to <persName>Waterhouse</persName>. <persName>Waterhouse</persName> himself went one night to <persName>Lydia Lockwood</persName>, wife of <persName>Lieutenant James Lockwood</persName>, and bought of her, in the presence of <persName>Mrs. Deborah Benedick</persName>, a barrel of cider, which he took away in a cart. He paid with a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>
                  <persName>bill</persName>, and <persName>Mrs. Lockwood</persName> gave him twenty shillings in change. He also at about this time uttered another 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <persName>bill</persName> to <persName>Joshua</persName>
                  <persName>Raymond</persName> of <placeName>Norwalk</placeName>.</p>
               <p>His companion was about the same nefarious business, for Elizabeth Hoyt, wife of Daniel Hoyt, was paid a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill by a stranger who was a "short well set man, broad flatt face a short neck a brownish complexion," whose name she was later told was Abbott.</p>
               <p>It was presently discovered that all these bills were false, and on April 19 a warrant was issued at <placeName>Greenwich</placeName> by <persName>Joshua Knapp, J.P</persName>, for the arrest of <persName>Waterhouse</persName> and <persName>Abbott</persName>. <persName>Samuel Miles</persName>, Sr., of <placeName>Greenwich</placeName> seized <persName>Waterhouse</persName> and found in his chest on board the sloop two copper plates, from which the bills had been made, and six or seven bills not yet finished. With a posse of eight men he also made a vain pursuit after <persName>Abbott</persName>.</p>
               <p>Two days later Constable <persName>Isaac Brown</persName> of <placeName>Norwalk</placeName> complained to <persName>John Copp, J.P.</persName>, who issued a warrant for the arrest of Waterhouse,
<pb n="55"/>
who, it would seem, must have been released by Justice <persName>Knapp</persName> or had escaped from custody.

               <p>In May, <persName>Waterhouse</persName>, confined in the jail of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> County, sent word to his brother, <persName>Abraham Waterhouse</persName> of <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>, begging him to take pity on him and to furnish the bail necessary for his release. <persName>Abraham</persName> was induced to sign a bond of £300 for his brother's appearance at the Superior Court to be held in August. When the court met, <persName>Waterhouse</persName> was indicted for passing false bills but failed to appear, so his bond was declared forfeited. <persName>Abraham Waterhouse</persName> sent a memorial to the Assembly and in October, 1733, that body reduced the amount he must pay to £150 plus costs, and the sheriff of the county, <persName>Ebenezer Dimon</persName>, was then to be acquitted of the judgment of £300 given by the Superior Court against him for his failure to produce <persName>Joseph Waterhouse</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n6">

               <p>On April 26, 1732, three persons, <persName>Joseph Miller</persName> of <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName>, his journeyman, <persName>Hezekiah Cox</persName>, who was a saddler by trade, and a transient, <persName>Hill Chandley</persName>, were taken into custody because of a complaint made against them by <persName>Joseph Farnsworth</persName>. The story of their activities, as learned from their examinations and a petition of <persName>Cox</persName>, is as follows: <persName>Cox</persName> was born and raised in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, where he married and had one child; on coming to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> he found employment with <persName>Joseph Miller</persName> in <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName> and lived at the home of <persName>Miller</persName> and his wife <persName>Abigail</persName>; there <persName>Cox</persName> was introduced to some evil-minded persons who intended to engage in counterfeiting; <persName>Miller</persName> gave <persName>Hill Chandley</persName> some 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills, which <persName>Chandley</persName> imitated in about half an hour; later <persName>Chandley</persName> forged £3 <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>
                  <pb n="56"/>
bills and with money given him by <persName>Miller</persName> bought paper, lampblack and red lead for counterfeiting purposes; <persName>Cox</persName> passed some of the bad money, one £3 bill to <persName>John Austin</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName> and another to <persName>Mrs. Anne Smith</persName>, also of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>.</p>
               <p>When the authorities instituted a search after them, <persName>Cox</persName> and <persName>Chandley</persName> fled and hid in the barn of Charles Buckley. They were, however, found and taken up, together with <persName>Miller</persName>, and all three were lodged in jail from April 27 to June 2. <persName>Cox</persName> and <persName>Chandley</persName> were indicted on May 23 at the Superior Court held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, <persName>Chandley</persName> for forging two £3 <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> bills and <persName>Cox</persName> for passing them. <persName>Miller</persName> apparently was not prosecuted but was released on June 2. <persName>Chandley</persName> was tried and acquitted but <persName>Cox</persName> was convicted and punished in accordance with the law. <persName>Farnsworth</persName>, as informer, asked for and doubtless received the reward of £20 due him.<ref target="#CH5-n7">

                  <persName>John Bellamy</persName>, a blacksmith, who had a shop in the Parish of <placeName>Horseneck</placeName> in <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>, was complained of on January 23, 1735, to <persName>Nathaniel Peck, J.P.</persName>, by <persName>Solomon Close</persName>, a grand juror of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> County. Close charged that the blacksmith had been coining and passing half pistoles. The justice issued a warrant, and Constable <persName>Nathan Reynolds</persName> apprehended <persName>Bellamy</persName> and took him before the magistrate. At the hearing <persName>Jabez John Quick</persName>, <persName>John Adington</persName>, <persName>Ely Parson</persName> and <persName>Uriah Harmell</persName> gave evidence that induced Justice <persName>Peck</persName> to order that the prisoner be jailed. <persName>Thomas Hill</persName>, the sheriff, however, released his charge in bail of £100 but the blacksmith failed to appear at the Superior Court held in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> on February 25, 1735, so that the sheriff was ordered to pay a fine of £100.</p>
               <p>Constable <persName>Reynolds</persName> on April 30 complained of <persName>Bellamy</persName> to <persName>Ebenezer Mead, J.P.</persName>, who had the suspected counterfeiter arrested, examined him and bound him over to the next session of the Superior Court. This time <persName>Bellamy</persName> secured bail of £500, furnished by <persName>Gersham Lockwood</persName>. The witnesses at the hearing before the justice were <persName>Abraham Todd</persName>, <persName>Theophilus Peck</persName>, <persName>Joshua Knapp</persName>, <persName>Nathaniel</persName> and <persName>Ezekiel Lockwood</persName> and <persName>Nathan Smith</persName>. <persName>Nathaniel Lockwood</persName> had obtained a half pistole, made by <persName>Bellamy</persName>, from his brother, <persName>Ezekiel Lockwood</persName>. <persName>Abraham Todd</persName> stated that after <persName>Bellamy</persName> had forfeited his bond of £100 by not appearing at court in February he, <persName>Todd</persName>, had seen iron dies in the blacksmith's possession and had remonstrated with him about his evil conduct, telling him what a grief he would be to his father. <persName>Bellamy</persName> was charged at the Superior Court on August 26 with having made Spanish half pistoles out of brass and other

               <p>A little is known of his movements between 1735 and 1739: he had made a trip to <placeName>England</placeName>, probably in 1736, and in the summer of 1738, according to the testimony of <persName>Thomas Philips</persName> of <placeName>Durham</placeName>, he was going by the name of "<persName>John Bello</persName>" and travelled in <persName>Philip's</persName> company from <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> to <placeName>Albany</placeName>. He had not mended his ways, for about the middle of February he passed two counterfeit 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bills, one to <persName>Samuel Cooke</persName> of <placeName>Cheshire</placeName> and the other to <persName>Henry Bristoll</persName> of <placeName>Wallingford</placeName>. <persName>Samuel Darling</persName> of <placeName>New Haven</placeName> traced one such bill back to <persName>Bellamy</persName> and on February 27, 1739, complained against him to <persName>Joseph Whiting</persName>, assistant. <persName>Whiting</persName> had <persName>Bellamy</persName> arrested and examined him on March 2. The prisoner said that he had obtained the false bills either three years before from <persName>Moses Clark</persName> of <placeName>New Haven</placeName> or from his father, <persName>Matthew Bellamy</persName>, in the summer of 1738. He was released on bail of £300 provided by himself and his father for his appearance at the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> in August. On the second day of the session he came before the court and was indicted, but on the following day, when called three times, he did not appear, and the bond was declared forfeited.

               <p>In 1735 one <persName>Ivory Lucas</persName>, a worker in metals, presumably either a silversmith or a blacksmith, was living in <placeName>New London</placeName> and had in his service two apprentices, <persName>Nicholas Ghanter</persName> and <persName>George Dennis</persName>. In June he executed a commission for <persName>John Gardner</persName> of the <persName>Isle of Wight</persName>, referred to by one of the apprentices as "My Lord Gardner." The task was the making of about one thousand Spanish pistoles of brass (probably with alloy of other metal), which were stamped out on a rock, both sides of the coin being struck at the same time. The result was, apparently, fairly satisfactory, for <persName>Lucas</persName> told his apprentices that the pieces would do to send off to sea. <persName>Gardner</persName>, who paid ten pence for each counterfeit, put away the coins at home in a box and probably intended to take them away to the <placeName>Isle of Wight</placeName>. In any case it was his plan to keep them until his death and leave them for his children.</p>
               <p>The business probably came to light through the fact that <persName>Ghanter</persName> found one of the false pistoles and gave it, to be kept for him, to <persName>Mary Tilden</persName> of <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, to whom he recounted the whole story. <persName>Mary</persName> very likely talked of the matter and in any event it came to the attention of <persName>John Richards, J.P.</persName>, who on June 12 had <persName>Lucas</persName> arrested and bound him over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>New London</placeName> on September 23. The suspected coiner was released on bail of £500, which was furnished by <persName>Lucas</persName> himself, <persName>Solomon Coit</persName> of <placeName>New London</placeName> and <persName>William Brookfield</persName> of <placeName>Lyme</placeName>. He was indicted in September for coining and passing, was tried, found guilty of coining, though not of passing, and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months and to pay costs of £13/11/2.<ref target="#CH5-n14">

               <p>
                  <persName>Henry Basil</persName> (or <persName>Bassell</persName>) of <placeName>Middletown</placeName> fell under suspicion of making and passing bad paper money. He had lived, before coming to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, in <placeName>Newport</placeName>, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, where he had a brother named <persName>John</persName> and where, according to depositions made by a <persName>Mr. Lyndon</persName> and by <persName>Joshua Stetson</persName> of that town, he was considered to be worth £1,000 and was known to have money to lend. He was taken into custody on August 23, 1735, by Deputy Sheriff <persName>Timothy Bigelow</persName> and was examined by <persName>Nathaniel Stanly</persName>, assistant. <persName>Bigelow</persName> had found four counterfeit bills in his possession, three of £5 and one of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., all of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. The prisoner claimed that he had received the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill from a man in Westfield for two books but said he did not recall where he had obtained the other notes.</p>
               <p>Previously, it was ascertained, <persName>Basil</persName> had tried in <placeName>Boston</placeName> to pass a bad £5 <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill to a <persName>Mrs. Bridgham</persName>, who scrupled it, and, when a justice of the peace there named Tylor asked to see the bill, <persName>Basil</persName> had refused to show it. One Abijah Bunce, a sailor on <persName>Captain James Knowles'</persName> sloop, testified that when the ship was at <placeName>Boston</placeName>
                  <persName>Basil</persName> had put on board two boxes, which he said were worth £500, and told <persName>Bunce</persName> to take special care not to wet them. Soon Deacon Bridgham had sent for <persName>Bunce</persName> and questioned him about Basil. According to the deacon, <persName>Basil</persName> had offered him a false £5 <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill and, when he informed <persName>Basil</persName> that it was counterfeit, <persName>Basil</persName> had hastily snatched it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Nathaniel Stanly</persName> set bail for his prisoner at the extraordinarily high figure of £1,000, which <persName>Basil</persName> could not furnish, so that he was imprisoned until the next session of the Superior Court at <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in September. He was then charged with forging a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill but the grand jury returned his indictment ignoramus, and it was ordered that he be dismissed on payment of costs.<ref target="#CH5-n15">

               <p>In September, 1735, discovery was made of a band of counterfeiters who included in their operations the forging of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> paper money. The <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Boston</placeName> Evening-Post</hi> of Monday, September 15, 1735, published this item:
<q>We have an Account from <hi rend="italic">Providence</hi>, that one <persName>Dilsell</persName> has lately been committed to Prison there, for uttering counterfeit Bills on the Colony of <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>
                     </hi>, there being found upon him when taken up, near <hi rend="italic">One Hundred Pounds</hi> in the said Counterfeit Bills, mostly of the highest Denomination. 'Tis said he has made a full Discovery of that villanous Affair, and that he received his Bills of one <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>William Mortimore</persName>
                     </hi>, to put off for him, for which Service he was to have one half, and said that <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Mortimore</persName>
                     </hi> was gone towards <placeName>Boston</placeName>, and that another Person was concerned, who lives at the Eastward. Information of this coming to Town, Search was made for the said <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Mortimore</persName>
                     </hi>, and last Monday Night he was taken in a publick House near the Town-Dock, and carried before <persName>Mr. Justice <hi rend="italic">Savage</hi>
                     </persName>, where he was examined and searched, and there was found in his Pocket-Book, 4 counterfeit <hi rend="italic">Ten Shilling</hi> Bills, and in the Foot of a Stocking in his Portmanteau one <hi rend="italic">Five Pound</hi> and 8 <hi rend="italic">Ten Shilling</hi> Bills. He said he took them in Trade, and denied that he knew them to be counterfeit: However, he was committed to Prison, where he is like to lie till the Assizes in <hi rend="italic">February</hi> next. He has been used for some Time to Trade in Lumber between the <placeName>Eastward</placeName> and <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Rhoad-Island</placeName>.</hi> It is said that these counterfeit Bills were struck off and signed in <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Ireland</placeName>
                     </hi>, and a Chest full of them brought into these Parts, and that <hi rend="italic">Ten</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Twelve Thousand Pounds</hi> has already been uttered. They are of the following Denominations, viz. <hi rend="italic">Five Pounds</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Forty Shillings</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Twenty Shillings</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Ten Shillings</hi>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The person named <persName>Dilsell</persName> was probably the "<persName>Forrist Dolzin</persName>" mentioned in correspondence between the governors of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. Governor <persName>Talcott</persName> wrote from <placeName>Hartford</placeName> on September 29, 1735, to <persName>Governor Belcher</persName>:
<q>And, Sir, I hear you have taken into custody, <persName>Forrist Dolzin</persName>, and <persName>Wm Mortimore</persName>, on suspicion of counterfeiting the £5 and ten s. bills of this Govrment, &amp;c. And it's also reported here that a chest is secured,
<pb n="62"/>
wherein is found £100,000 counterfeits. If so it be, it's a favor to us in particular, and if the perpetrators of such Villineys may be convict and receive their just punishment, that others may here fear, it will be a favor to the world.</q>
                  <q>I remember when <persName>Peter Gardner</persName> had his tryal at <placeName>Boston</placeName>, for counterfeiting the £5 Bills of this Govrment, our Printer was sent for to bring the Plate, &amp;c. And if these fellows, or either of them should be brought to tryal, and our plates or anything else from us will be necessary to be had there, I shall be glad to hear of it by the bearer, or the first opportunity, that nothing may be wanting on our part for the effectual prosecution of such wretches as would destroy the publick currency, and thereby bring a disadvantage upon all trade and commerce between the Govrments.<ref target="#CH5-n16">

               <p>The <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> authorities in any event were energetic in their investigations, which had started with the arrest of <persName>Dilsell</persName> or <persName>Dolzin</persName>. The <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Boston</placeName> Evening-Post</hi> of September 22, 1735, carried this account:
<q>On Tuesday last, <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>John Davis</persName>
                     </hi>, Master of a coasting Sloop, was committed to Prison here (<placeName>Boston</placeName>), on Suspicion of uttering counterfeit Bills on the Colony of <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.</hi> He has several Times since been examined by some of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace, and has made a free and open Confession of his Guilt, and discovered his Accomplices, and 'tis not doubted but that he will be admitted an Evidence for the King against such of his Brethren in Iniquity as are or shall be taken.</q>
                  <pb n="63"/>
                  <q>We hear that two Men have been taken up for the same offence at <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Wells</placeName>,</hi> but instead of committing them to Prison, we are told they are admitted to Bail, one in <hi rend="italic">three</hi> and the other in <hi rend="italic">five hundred Pounds</hi>, tho' it is Death by the Law to counterfeit the Bills of Credit, or to utter them knowing them to be such, Tis said the principal Offender has made his Escape.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Davis</persName>' confession, made on September 18, 1735, has been preserved and tells how, about November, 1733, he met <persName>William Patten</persName> of <placeName>Wells</placeName> at his blacksmith shop. <persName>Patten</persName> gave him ten 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> and told him he might keep half of the proceeds from all he could pass. At <persName>Piscataqua</persName>, however, <persName>Davis</persName> heard talk of counterfeit 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills in circulation, so he made no effort to pass those he had. Later, at <placeName>Wells</placeName>, he gave an account of this to <persName>Patten</persName>, who told him that <persName>John Macdonnell</persName> was gone to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to get some £5 bills made and that upon his return <persName>Davis</persName> might have some of the £5 bills to pass.</p>
               <p>In the fall of 1734 <persName>Davis</persName> met <persName>Patten</persName> in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, and <persName>Patten</persName> then came to <persName>Davis</persName>' house in company with <persName>Macdonnell</persName> and <persName>William Mortimore</persName>. <persName>Davis</persName> took <persName>Mortimore</persName> to <placeName>Wells</placeName>, where <persName>Mortimore</persName> showed him a bundle of £5 <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills which he said he had brought over with him. Later in the same day <persName>Patten</persName> gave <persName>Davis</persName> £42 in £5 and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills to be passed off, while a few days later <persName>Macdonnell</persName> gave him twenty-two £5 bills for the same purpose. <persName>Davis</persName> then sailed for <placeName>Boston</placeName> and kept the bills in a wig box. Eventually he tried to pass a £5 bill to <persName>Mr. Brewster</persName> and another to <persName>Captain Winter</persName> but both bills were refused as bad. Still later he heard that one <persName>Bragden</persName>, a miller in York, had a considerable quantity of the new bills.</p>
               <p>In August, 1735, <persName>Davis</persName> seemingly became worried, for he threw them overboard, tied up in a piece of bunting with a brick, keeping out only six £5 bills which he passed in <placeName>Newport</placeName>. In July he had obtained of <persName>Mortimore</persName> five 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills, one of which he passed in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and the rest of which he tore into pieces at sea. <persName>Davis</persName> also claimed that he saw <persName>Mortimore</persName> pass a number of counterfeits: a £5 bill at <persName>Mr. Whiting's</persName> and another of the same denomination at <persName>Burden's Ferry</persName> in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>; a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill to Mr. Howard at <placeName>Newport</placeName> and
<pb n="64"/>
another to <persName>Mr. Jackson</persName> on the <persName>Long Wharf</persName> in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, and a £5 bill to a woman who kept a public house at the Sign of the White Horse between <placeName>Newbury</placeName> and <placeName>Hampton</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n19">

               <p>As a result, no doubt, of Davis' disclosures five persons were arrested in York County, among them <persName>Macdonald</persName>, who was said to have brought in £100,000 in counterfeits from <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n20">

               <p>The <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> General Assembly in session in October, 1735, being informed that the colony's £5, 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills had been counterfeited, ordered that £25,000 of new bills be struck from new plates "to be engraved deeper and fairer" and that the Treasurer of the Colony use them to exchange for the emission that had been counterfeited.<ref target="#CH5-n22">
                     <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                  </ref> It was further decided that the public be warned, and the following proclamation signed by Governor <persName>Talcott</persName> and dated "<placeName>Hartford</placeName>, November 11, 1735," was printed as an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Boston</placeName> Evening-Post</hi> of December 1, 1735:
<q>To prevent Persons being deceived, and suffering Loss and Damage by Counterfeit Bills, &amp;c. Let all Persons, and more especially the Treasurer of this Colony of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, take heed at their Peril, that He or They be not deceived in Taking the Counterfeits of the £.V 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               </p>
               <p>The Assembly in May of the next year passed an act forbidding the halving or quartering of any <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills and ordering the treasurer to accept halved or quartered bills up to May 20th next but
<pb n="65"/>
after that date not to receive or pay out such divided bills. The preamble to the act reads:
<q>Whereas the bills of credit of this Colony of sundry denominations have been counterfeited and uttered by evilminded persons; and further to carry on the fraud and deceit, it hath been wickedly practiced to break said bills into halves and quarters; whereby our publick officers and private persons are rendered unable to discover the counterfeit bills and the cheat and deceit therein...<ref target="#CH5-n23">

               <p>It may be noted that the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Assembly soon took similar action by forbidding the tearing or defacing of its own paper money or of the bills of the neighboring colonies, and in October, 1737, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> passed a further act to prevent the dividing of its bills.<ref target="#CH5-n24">

               </head>
               <p>In December, 1738, a false £5 <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill was stopped in the hands of one <persName>Waterhouse</persName> in <placeName>Lyme</placeName> by <persName>Richard Lord, J. P</persName>. <persName>Lord</persName> examined <persName>Waterhouse</persName> and then other persons until he came to the conclusion that the culprit was <persName>Samuel Fox</persName>, 2nd., of <placeName>New London</placeName>. He released <persName>Fox</persName> on bail of £100 for his appearance at the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Norwich</placeName> on March 4, 1739. <persName>Fox</persName> was indicted but when called three times he did not appear and his bail was declared forfeited. Justice Lord then applied to the Assembly for a reward of £20 as informer, but this was refused. When, however, the magistrate pointed out that "at one time and another" he had stopped six £5 counterfeit <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills, four £5 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> counterfeits and also several bills of the denominations of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., amounting in all to nearly £60, the Assembly voted him £10 for his services.<ref target="#CH5-n28">

               <p>By March 30, 1739, <persName>Fox</persName> had been taken up and also in custody were <persName>Hugh Mosier</persName> and <persName>Stephen Potter</persName>, all of them suspected of having passed the false bill.

There is no record of what befell <persName>Fox</persName> or <placeName>Mosier</placeName>, but the indictment against <persName>Potter</persName>, who was charged with having passed the counterfeit bill about December 25, 1738, to <persName>Nathan Marvin</persName> of <placeName>Lyme</placeName>, was returned ignoramus by the grand jury, and he was discharged.<ref target="#CH5-n29">

               <p>In July a warning to this effect appeared in <placeName>Boston</placeName> newspapers:</p>
               <p>To prevent unwary Persons from being imposed upon 'tis tho't proper to inform the Publick, that last Monday a Discovery was made of a fresh Counterfeit, in Imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Five Shilling</hi> Bill of the old Plate of <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>:</hi> The Face of the Bill seems nearly imitated, except that it is done off something smutty; but the Back side of the Bill at first View discovers it must be False; instead of Types or Printing-Letters, a Plate is made use of, the Mark of which evidently appears; and the Letters engraven throughout, are wretchedly uneven and disproportioned.<ref target="#CH5-n31">

               </p>
               <p>Some of the authors of this cheat were discovered, as is revealed by the following item in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Boston</placeName> Evening-Post</hi> of October i, 1739:</p>
               <p>Several Men belonging to the County of <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Essex</placeName>
                  </hi>, have lately been committed to his Majesty's Goal in this Town (<placeName>Boston</placeName>), on a strong Suspicion of their being concern'd with others not yet taken, in striking off and uttering false or counterfeit Bills in Imitation of the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>
                  </hi> Five Pound Bills. Vast Numbers of these false Bills are passing among us, and we are credibly informed, that there have been several Persons constantly employed in the above mentioned County, to strike off those Bills, which have been delivered to other vicious Persons their Accomplices to vend in the Country, which they have done with too good Success, notwithstanding the Publick has for a long Time been apprized of their being abroad: And by the Number and Circumstances of those said to be in the Conspiracy, (some of whom are Persons of Estate and Character) one would be tempted to think, that they had argued themselves into a Belief, that it is no Sin or Crime to cheat and defraud their honest Neighbours of their Substance, to raise their own Fortunes. But these are wretched Casuists! We are told, that the same Gang of Villans have prepared Plates for striking off several other Denominations, viz. <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>
                  </hi> Three Pounds, <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>
                  </hi> Five Shillings, &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>
                  </hi> Five Shilling Bills are abroad, but ill done, especially the back side, which is cut on Copper, whereas the true Bills are printed on the Back with Types, as this Paper is.</p>
               <p>In October of 1739 the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Assembly passed legislation to deal with one aspect of counterfeiting and passing. The act reads:</p>
               <pb n="69"/>
               <p>Whereas some persons, through ignorance and inadvertency, receive for their debts and in their dealings and business, false and counterfeit bills, made in imitation of the bills of this or the neighbouring governments; and their being no expedite remedy already provided in the common course of the law for the possessor or possessors against such person or persons that shall have delivered and passed said bill or bills; whereby great injustice is done: For remedy whereof,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Governour, Council and Representatives</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in General Court assembled</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and by the authority of the same</hi>, That whensoever any person shall be the possessor of any false or counterfeit bill, made in imitation of the bills of credit of this or the neighbouring governments, it shall be the duty of such person, upon his discovering the same to be false or counterfeit, to carry and deliver the same to some assistant or justice of the peace and inform him that he concludes the same to be false and counterfeit; and if such assistant or justice of the peace shall suppose the same to be false, as aforesaid, he shall seize the same and write the name of the person of whom he receives it on the back side thereof, and that it was delivered to him as a counterfeit bill. And such person that so delivers up such bill may, after such delivery, go to the person of whom he received the same, and demand of him pay for such bill, informing him where such bill is. And if the person of whom he received the said bill shall refuse or neglect to make him satisfaction therefore, or without such demand or refusal, if need so require, may bring his action for his damages in not paying him for said bill, or for putting off such bill to him, before any court, assistant or justice of the peace, proper to try the same, alledging the same to be delivered up as aforesaid. And in the tryal of any such cause, if the bill be found to be false or counterfeit, to the satisfaction of the court that tries the same, the said court shall proceed to enquire into the equity of the cause, by examining the parties under oath and taking any other evidence as they shall judge just and right; and, upon their finding to their satisfaction that such plaintiff received the same bill of the defendant, they shall give judgment for the plaintiff for his just damages and cost of delivering up the said bill to the authority and prosecuting his action; provided always said bill was delivered up, as aforesaid, before the plaintiff offered said bill back to the person of whom he received the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid</hi>, That it shall be the duty of every assistant or justice of the peace that shall have such bill

delivered to them, safely to convey the same bill to any court where the same may be wanted. And all and every person that hath had any such bill that shall by the possessor be delivered up, as aforesaid, and hath satisfied the person to whom he delivered said bill for the same, shall have the like liberty in prosecuting and taking remedy as aforesaid; provided always, that no person shall be prosecuted, in form aforesaid, but within one year after he puts off such bill, which fact may be inquired of in form aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid</hi>, That if any court, assistant or justice of the peace, hath had the possession of such counterfeit or false bill for the space of one year, he shall destroy the same.<ref target="#CH5-n32">

               <p>On February 6, 1740, <persName>Thomas Welles, J.P</persName>., of <placeName>Glastonbury</placeName> seized a false £5 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill found in the hands of <persName>Joseph Parks</persName> of <placeName>Middletown</placeName>. <persName>Parks,</persName> however, swore that about November 8, 1739, on Long Island he had received the bill from <persName>Ephraim Sheeler</persName> (or <persName>Shayler</persName>) of <placeName>Bolton</placeName>. <persName>Sheeler</persName> was arrested on February 7 and was bound over to the next session of the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in March, 1740. When the court met, proclamation was made, and, when no one appeared to prosecute, the prisoner was dismissed on payment of costs.<ref target="#CH6-n1">

                  <persName>Henry King</persName> of <placeName>Middletown</placeName> in March, 1741, complained to <persName>Jabez Hamlin, J.P.</persName>, against <persName>William Baxter</persName> of <placeName>Westchester</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, for having on March 14 altered a 2/6 <placeName>New York</placeName> bill to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and then passed it to the wife of Henry King. A warrant for Baxter's arrest was issued, and King, with help, went in hot pursuit of him and arrested him. Justice Hamlin committed the suspected counterfeiter to jail but Baxter was released presently on bail of £100 for his appearance at the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in September. When, however, he was called three times, he failed to appear, and his bond was forfeited. King petitioned the Assembly for the £20 reward due him as the informer and for expenses which amounted to £6/8/6, and eventually the £20 was granted him.<ref target="#CH6-n2">

               <p>The two men were <persName>Jonathan Richardson</persName> of Providence and <persName>Edward Aldrich</persName> of <placeName>Uxbridge</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. Unhappily for them, they became acquainted with several persons in <placeName>Salem</placeName>, <persName>David</persName> and <persName>Joseph Boyce</persName>, <persName>Joseph Verey</persName>, and one <persName>Linsey</persName>. <persName>David</persName>
                  <persName>Boyce</persName>, about July 10, 1742, delivered to <persName>Richardson</persName> two false 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills and told him they were such. <persName>Linsey</persName> told <persName>Aldrich</persName> that he had the plates in his house and that <persName>Joseph Boyce</persName> had printed some money on them, bills of the
<pb n="73"/>
denominations of £3 and 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <persName>Linsey</persName> also stated that he had almost finished a plate for <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> new money and that, if <persName>Richardson</persName> and <persName>Aldrich</persName> came in about a fortnight, they should have as much money as they would. <persName>Joseph Boyce</persName> had the plate from which the Merchants Notes were made and displayed a handful of them unsigned; Boyce informed them that he had let <persName>William Philips</persName> of <placeName>Windham</placeName> have some of them and he gave <persName>Richardson</persName> £36 in false bills in an exchange of horses. Verey gave <persName>Aldrich</persName> a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. counterfeit bill to pass, with the understanding that he could keep half the profit. When <persName>Richardson</persName> and <persName>Aldrich</persName> left <placeName>Salem</placeName>, they had a considerable sum in bad bills, <persName>Richardson</persName> about £104 and <persName>Aldrich</persName> about £153.</p>
               <p>In <placeName>Hartford</placeName> on July 22 <persName>Aldrich</persName> passed to <persName>Hannah Pitkin</persName>, wife of <persName>Samuel Pitkin</persName>, three counterfeit bills of the 1738 emission of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, two of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one of £3, while <persName>Richardson</persName> uttered, apparently to the <persName>Pitkins</persName>, three £3 bills and one 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill. <persName>Pitkin</persName> quickly discovered the cheat and complained to <persName>Joseph Buckingham, J.P.</persName>, who issued a warrant for the arrest of the two men. Deputy Sheriff <persName>Timothy Bigelow</persName> overtook them in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>, where he found six £3 and seven 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills, all counterfeits, on the person of <placeName>Aldrich</placeName>; between the joist and the floor of the room where he seized the men he found a pocketbook belonging to <persName>Richardson</persName> with three £3 bills and three 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills in it, all false. On July 23 Justice Buckingham bound the counterfeiters over to the next session of the Superior Court in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> and set bail at £500 for each. On September 7 both were indicted for passing and were tried, convicted, and sentenced, each to have his right ear cut off, to be branded on the forehead with C, to be imprisoned for life, to have all property confiscated, to be debarred forever from any trade or dealing and to pay costs.<ref target="#CH6-n5">

               <p>From jail <persName>Aldrich</persName> and <persName>Richardson</persName> in October, 1742, sent to the General Assembly a joint memorial, setting forth that each had a wife and several children and little or no estate. Early in the year they had fallen in with evil persons who induced them to pass counterfeit money and they were arrested at the very beginning of their operations. Now in jail they suffered from anxiety for their families and from pinching hunger. They knew no trade to work at in jail and had but a naked floor beneath them. Their prayer for release was granted on condition that they pay all costs of prosecution, imprisonment and support in jail and the reward, £40, to the informer. Their freedom, however, was further to depend on their never being found in the colony once ten days from the date of their release had elapsed. If they should ever be discovered in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> again, they would returned to the workhouse for life.<ref target="#CH6-n6">

                     <placeName>Boston</placeName> Weekly News-Letter</hi> of the same date as Willard's letter, August 26, carried the following detailed account of the affair:</p>
               <p>Last Week <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Robert Neal</persName>
                  </hi> a Marriner, belonging to <placeName>Salem</placeName>, who lately came hither from <placeName>London</placeName> in Capt. <hi rend="italic">Fones,</hi> was apprehended and examin'd before two of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for uttering false Bills of the
<pb n="75"/>
Colony of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName> in imitation of those emitted in the Year 1740, five of which Bills, were found about him, viz. four Ten Shillings and one of Five Shillings.</p>
               <p>Upon some further Examination he acknowledged that the said Bills were made and sign'd in <placeName>London</placeName>, and that he brought over a Number with him, which were in a Box hid in a rocky Place, at <placeName>Salem</placeName>; accordingly the Officers, taking him along with them to the Place he told them of, and after considerable Pains in turning over a great many large Stones, they at last found the said Box hid underneath one of them, and came to Town with it last Saturday Evening; Upon opening.the Box there was found in it four Plates engraven, one Plate containing 2 Bills in imitation of the above mention'd 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the Colony of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>, with a Plate for the Back-side of the said Bills; on another Plate, was two in imitation of the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the Colony of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, the last Emission, and also a Plate for the Back-side of the said Bills in imitation of printing Letters.

                  <persName>William Robinson</persName> persuaded <persName>Stephen Covel</persName> to take a counterfeit £5 bill and three pounds in other money and redeem a bad £8 bill that <persName>William</persName> had uttered to <persName>Benjamin Belknap</persName> in Providence; <persName>William</persName> also tried to induce <persName>Joseph Simons</persName> to change a 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill where he was not known; he told <persName>Samuel Winter</persName> that he had changed a false note in Scituate; he offered 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to <persName>Nathaniel</persName> Coller if he would pass a counterfeit 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill.</p>
               <p>Both brothers were quite brazen about their nefarious doings: <persName>Joseph</persName> boasted to <persName>John Grover</persName> that he did not mind losing his ears if he had money enough; <persName>Hannah Covel</persName>, who lived for about a month during the winter at <persName>Joseph Robinson's</persName>, testified that one night <persName>William Robinson</persName> came and the two brothers sat drinking before the fire, when <persName>Joseph</persName> pulled out a bunch of money. When <persName>William</persName> asked what made him pull out "that Divellish Counterfeit money," <persName>Joseph</persName> threw one bill into the fire and put the rest back in his pocket.</p>

               <p>On July 13, 1744, <persName>Elisha Parker</persName> and <persName>Robert Martyn</persName>, both of <placeName>Wallingford</placeName>, were in <placeName>Killingworth</placeName>, where they passed some counterfeit <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills to <persName>Elisha Willcocks</persName> and others. <persName>Willcocks</persName> detected the fraud the same day and complained against them to <persName>Samuel Hill, J.P</persName>., of <placeName>New Haven</placeName> County. A warrant was issued for their arrest, and they were apprehended on July 14 at the house of Captain <persName>John Scranton</persName> in <placeName>Guilford</placeName> by Constable <persName>Timothy Meigs</persName> of that town. The constable found in <persName>Parker's</persName> pack ten half crown <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills, new tenor, four 7/6 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills, old tenor, and two 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Boston</placeName> bills, old tenor; in Martyn's pack he found one 7/6 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill, old tenor. He took his prisoners before Justices <persName>Andrew Ward</persName> and <persName>Samuel Hill</persName> at <persName>Hill's</persName> home in <placeName>Guilford</placeName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Parker</persName>, when examined, said that he got £39/10 for a horse which he had sold to a stranger, who said he came from <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, in the woods between <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName> and <placeName>Great Swamp</placeName>, while <persName>Martyn</persName> said that the bill in his possession came from Parker. The justices committed both men and set bail for each at £300.</p>
               <p>The prisoners had uttered the bad paper money in <placeName>New London</placeName> County. Elihu Hall, discovering that the two men therefore could not be arraigned in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> County for crimes committed elsewhere, sought for evidence of other offences and found that the men had passed forged bills to persons in <placeName>Wallingford</placeName>.<ref target="#CH6-n9">

               <p>In 1744 the attention of the authorities in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, as well as in other provinces, was directed to a band of counterfeiters residing in the Oblong or Equivalent Tract, which had been ceded by <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> to <placeName>New York</placeName> on May 14, 1731. In a letter dated August 18, 1744, Governor Morris wrote to Governor Clinton of <placeName>New York</placeName> about the matter and sent along several examinations and papers concerned with the business. Clinton communicated his information to Governor <persName>Jonathan Law</persName> of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, who sent instructions to several justices of the peace to inquire into the matter.<ref target="#CH6-n15">

for his appearance at the Superior Court in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> in August. On August 19, 1745, Justice <persName>Samuel Hutchinson</persName> issued instructions to the constables to summon as witnesses against <persName>Nelson</persName>
                  <persName>Captain John Sprague</persName>, <persName>John Gay</persName>, <persName>James Betts</persName>, <persName>John Neland</persName> and <persName>Daniel Parke</persName>, all of <placeName>Sharon</placeName>.

When the court convened and <persName>Nelson</persName> was called, he did not appear.</p>
               <p>An explanation was forthcoming, for a letter, signed by <persName>Andrew Nelson</persName> and his father, had been sent to <persName>Samuel Darling</persName> of <placeName>New Haven</placeName>. It stated that Andrew had been pressed into the King's service, had got a substitute and that the substitute had fallen ill. The captain then insisted that <persName>Andrew</persName> serve. Accompanying documents showed that <persName>Captain Leonard Hoar</persName>, acting on orders from Colonel <persName>John Stoddard</persName>, had impressed Andrew to serve in guarding the western frontier and ordered him to impress his father's firelock gun for his use.<ref target="#CH6-n17">

               <p>Before long more of these 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills were passed by men from the Oblong: Jeremiah Thornton on February 5, 1745, at <placeName>Colchester</placeName> passed to <persName>James Glass</persName> of that town such a forged bill of the emission of 1741. Glass detected the cheat and reported the matter to <persName>Nathaniel Foot, J.P.</persName>, of <placeName>Colchester</placeName>, who had Thornton arrested.

Their prayer was granted on condition that they pay all costs and

charges and £20 each (the rewards given to the informer or informers against them, one of whom was <persName>James Glass</persName>) and with the understanding that if they were ever found in the colony after the ten days following their release had elapsed they were to be returned to the workhouse for life.<ref target="#CH6-n19">

               <head>The Gang in <placeName>Derby</placeName>
               </head>
               <p>A gang of counterfeiters in <placeName>Derby</placeName> began operations in 1745 and, at least through <persName>Joseph Boyce</persName>, was connected with the Oblong gang. The downfall of the men in <placeName>Derby</placeName> was brought about by <persName>Daniel Grant</persName> of <placeName>Newtown</placeName>, who in October, 1746, received from <persName>Samuel Sherman</persName> of <placeName>Newtown</placeName> a 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> new tenor bill. It seemed suspicious, so Grant took it to <placeName>New Haven</placeName> to Secretary <persName>George Wyllys</persName>, who judged it to be counterfeit. <persName>Sherman</persName> was arrested and released on a bail bond
<pb n="83"/>
of £300 furnished to Sheriff <persName>Thomas Hill</persName> by <persName>Samuel</persName> and his brother <persName>Benoni</persName>. <persName>Sherman's</persName> story was as follows: in April, 1746, in <placeName>Newtown</placeName> he and <persName>Dr. George Weed</persName> talked about money and on May 11 they went to <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>, where <persName>Sherman</persName> got three quarters of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> money from him and passed them in <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>. <persName>Dr. Weed</persName> said that his brother, <persName>Samuel Weed</persName> in <placeName>Derby</placeName>, signed them and could counterfeit any man's handwriting. Later <persName>George Weed</persName> at Sherman's house showed him a <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill that was not printed on the back and subsequently passed it in <placeName>Norwalk</placeName>. George told <persName>Sherman</persName> that the gang had a <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. old tenor plate. Again, on the night of October 13, <persName>George Weed</persName> came to <persName>Sherman's</persName> home and gave him three 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills—which he said were good—and <persName>Sherman</persName> gave him credit for them. It was one of these that he passed to Grant and which caused him to be imprisoned in the <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> County jail. On the night of October 26, while <persName>Sherman</persName> was in jail, <persName>Dr. Weed</persName>, who was let in by <persName>John Whitear</persName>, visited the prisoner and got a mug of flip, which he, <persName>Sherman</persName> and a negro prisoner drank. <persName>George Weed</persName> said that he had that same night passed to a tavernkeeper in <placeName>Stratford</placeName> a 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. counterfeit that came from the house in <placeName>Derby</placeName> and he urged <persName>Sherman</persName> to break jail. <persName>Sherman</persName> said he could easily do so in a quarter of an hour but decided against it, since he expected to get bail the next day. In this he was not disappointed, for he was released on bail on October 27.</p>
               <p>Immediately after his release <persName>Sherman</persName> set out to prosecute <persName>George Weed</persName>, whom he at once had arrested, The doctor, however, promptly broke away from the constable and made good his escape. <persName>Sherman</persName> then sent to <placeName>Derby</placeName> to have <persName>Samuel Weed</persName> and the rest of the gang apprehended. He himself failed to appear in court and his bond was forfeited, so that on May 20, 1749, he asked the Assembly to cancel his bond if he would pay all costs and charges, a request which that body rejected. Later, in large part no doubt because of the recommendation of Justices <persName>Thomas Tousey</persName> and <persName>Job Sherman</persName>, given because of his full confession and instrumentality in bringing the <placeName>Derby</placeName> gang to justice, the Assembly ordered the court to chancer the bond
<pb n="84"/>
down to such an amount as would cover the charges and the premium allowed to Grant as informer.<ref target="#CH6-n24">

               </p>
               <p>On November 16, 1746, <persName>Samuel Riggs, J.P.</persName>, issued a warrant for the arrest of <persName>Samuel Weed</persName>, who was apprehended the next day by <persName>Samuel Tomlinson</persName>, Constable of <placeName>Derby</placeName>. In <persName>Weed's</persName> house the constable found a press, two bottles of red ink and a sheet of paper judged to have a bill cut out of it. It seems probable that <persName>Weed</persName> was released on bail, for about the end of February, 1747, on an information lodged by <persName>Elihu Hall</persName>, he was arrested and jailed in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>. His wife soon set about planning his escape and enlisted the aid of his son, <persName>David</persName>, <persName>Joseph Weed</persName> of <placeName>Waterbury</placeName> (<persName>Samuel's</persName> brother), <persName>Joseph Trowbridge</persName> of <placeName>Waterbury</placeName>, and <persName>Samuel's</persName> negro slave <persName>Zadock</persName>. <persName>Zadock</persName> was promised his freedom for his part in the undertaking, while <persName>Trowbridge</persName>, who felt that <persName>Samuel</persName> was wrongfully imprisoned, was promised a reward and was encouraged by <persName>Ephraim Washborn</persName>. <persName>Sarah Weed</persName>, <persName>Samuel's</persName> wife set about to procure suitable tools for the attempt on the jail; to <persName>Trowbridge</persName> she gave money with which he purchased in <placeName>Milford</placeName> a file and a gimlet; she also had <persName>Daniel Tucker</persName>, a blacksmith of <placeName>Derby</placeName>, make her a burning iron three inches wide with a cutting edge, and this she took, together with a cold chisel and a file, to be used in the projected jail break.</p>
               <p>On Saturday evening, March 30, <persName>Trowbridge</persName>, <persName>Zadock</persName>, <persName>David</persName> and <persName>Joseph Weed</persName> all set out for <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, separating in order to avoid attracting attention, and then meeting again near the jail. <persName>Joseph</persName> went first to the prison and when he came back he reported that Samuel already had his irons off. <persName>Zadock</persName> had brought along a shoe knife and a tap augur, while <persName>Joseph</persName> had brought one iron and <persName>David</persName> another. While <persName>Trowbridge</persName> kept watch, the others bored a hole in the stud, then inserted a spike and got the stud out. At this a cry was raised and they fled and did not see <persName>Samuel</persName> when he escaped. All this took place between midnight and four o'clock in the morning. On his way back from <placeName>New Haven</placeName>
                  <persName>Trowbridge</persName> took from <placeName>Derby</placeName> two cows
<pb n="85"/>
for a debt owed him by <persName>Samuel Weed</persName>, while <persName>Samuel Weed, Jr.</persName>, drove some cattle to the house of <persName>Trowbridge's</persName> father to be cared for by <persName>John Weed</persName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Samuel Weed</persName> apparently made off for <placeName>Waterbury</placeName>, where he was presently seized by Constable <persName>Jacob Blakeslee</persName> and conveyed to the jail in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>. At the Superior Court held in that town he was indicted on April 29, 1747, pleaded guilty to a charge of counterfeiting 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and was sentenced in accordance with law.</p>
               <p>Before long action was taken to investigate the jail break and to take up the persons responsible for it. <persName>David Weed</persName>, probably because of his youth, was not apprehended but <persName>Trowbridge</persName>, <persName>Joseph Weed</persName> and <persName>Zadock</persName> were arrested on April 4 and examined by Justice <persName>John Hubbard</persName>. <persName>Zadock</persName> and <persName>Trowbridge</persName> confessed their guilt but <persName>Joseph</persName> pleaded not guilty until, on April 10, he also confessed that he was guilty. Each of the three was bound over in bail of £5,000 and committed to jail. At the April session of the Superior Court in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>
                  <persName>Joseph Weed</persName> was fined £100 and sentenced to find surety for his good behavior in the amount of £200 and to pay costs of £37/9/11; <persName>Zadock</persName> was sentenced to receive twenty stripes on his naked body; <persName>Trowbridge</persName> apparently was not punished and presumably was accepted as King's Evidence.</p>
               <p>The authorities, of course, were also interested in determining who the confederates of <persName>Samuel Weed</persName> were and in bringing them to justice. On December 23, 1746, <persName>Samuel</persName> Bassett, J.P., issued a warrant for the arrest of <persName>Edward Washborn</persName> of <placeName>Derby</placeName> and examined him. On the twenty-sixth Washborn was further questioned at the home of Captain <persName>John Riggs</persName> and then committed to the <placeName>New Haven</placeName> jail, from which he was released on bail of £500 provided by himself and his brother Ephraim. He was under suspicion of issuing six counterfeit 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills, and Constable <persName>Samuel Tomlinson</persName> had informed the justice that <persName>Silvester Wooster</persName> of <placeName>Derby</placeName> had made a press for <persName>Edward Washborn</persName> for counterfeiting bills. Apparently, from the silence of the records, Edward escaped prosecution. Another suspected member
<pb n="86"/>
of the gang was <persName>Jonas Tomlinson</persName>, also of <placeName>Derby</placeName>, who was charged with counterfeiting bills. On a warrant issued on April 29, 1747, he was arrested by <persName>Ebenezer Lines</persName>, a sheriff's deputy, and was examined by <persName>John Hubbard</persName> who bound him over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> in August. He was then released on bail of £500. He, too, appears to have escaped prosecution.</p>
               <p>Other associates of <persName>Samuel Weed</persName> were less fortunate. On April 15 <persName>Nathaniel Wooster</persName> of <placeName>Derby</placeName> was examined at an inferior court in <placeName>Derby</placeName>, at which he pleaded not guilty to a charge of passing. He admitted, however, that he knew about the counterfeiting, that he had two false 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills, that he had seen one <persName>Robert Lennox</persName> making plates and that he had seen <persName>Sam Weed</persName> and <persName>Edward Washborn</persName> strike six or seven twenty shilling bills new tenor. Finally he confessed that he had pressed one bill himself at the desire of <persName>Lennox</persName>. He was committed to the <placeName>New Haven</placeName> jail, was indicted in April, 1747, was tried and convicted and sentenced in accordance with law.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Daniel Tucker</persName>, blacksmith of <placeName>Derby</placeName>, was apprehended on a writ signed April 8, 1747, by Captain <persName>Samuel Riggs, J.P.</persName>, and was examined on the next day by Justice <persName>Hubbard</persName>. He at once made a full confession, which gives the clearest picture of the whole affair: in August, 1745, on the Town Street of <placeName>Derby</placeName> he met <persName>Gideon Washborn</persName>, who asked if he, <persName>Tucker</persName>, could shoe his horse for him. In the course of their conversation <persName>Gideon</persName> took out his pocketbook and showed the blacksmith a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. new tenor <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> bill, saying that they could have as many of these as they wanted.</p>
               <p>Later on <persName>Gideon</persName> had <persName>Tucker</persName> make him steel pens and told him that they had gotten Boyce out of jail, that Boyce was in <placeName>Derby</placeName> and that he was going to make some plates for himself, <persName>Gideon</persName>, for <persName>Edward Washborn</persName> and for <persName>Samuel Weed</persName>. The confederates needed copper for their plates, so they sent <persName>Jeremiah Ocain</persName> towards <placeName>New York</placeName> to buy some metal for their purpose, and he returned with a copper tea kettle, which they brought to <persName>Tucker</persName> and had him cut it into the form of a plate. With money supplied by <persName>Sarah Weed</persName>, <persName>Tucker</persName> bought
<pb n="87"/>
a copper pot at <persName>Mr. French's</persName> and also fashioned it into a plate. The gang needed ink and first tried lampblack and oil, which did not do at all. Therefore <persName>Weed</persName> sent to <placeName>Boston</placeName> by <persName>William Clark</persName>, who brought back for them nut galls and Ivory Black but reported that he could get no <placeName>Frankfort</placeName>. They set up their press in <persName>Edward Washborn's</persName> house, and there <persName>Edward</persName> and <persName>Gideon Washborn</persName>, <persName>Samuel Weed</persName> and <persName>Tucker</persName> struck off a number of bills. <persName>Tucker</persName> received two 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills from <persName>Edward Washborn</persName> but returned one to him and burned the other. Edward also gave him a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill and some quarters of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills, and <persName>Tucker</persName> passed two quarters to <persName>Mrs. Clark</persName>.</p>
               <p>The other associates set about passing their bills. <persName>Weed</persName> and <persName>Gideon Washborn</persName> told <persName>Tucker</persName> that they had uttered nearly £20 in <placeName>Stratford</placeName>, and <persName>Wooster</persName> claimed he had passed off some quarters of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills to <persName>Mrs. Clark</persName>, also explaining to the blacksmith how he pressed one 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill new tenor and one 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill "with his Tailors Goose on the Backside to press down the Letters that are stamped on the Same with a Card in Order to prepare the Same for a Plaister of Wax on ye Plate to take Letters out of the Backside of the Bill in Order to cut the Plate by..." At Mr. Clark's in 1745 <persName>Jonah Tomlinson</persName> had told <persName>Tucker</persName> about the making of money at the Oblong and later had showed him a 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> new tenor bill which had been finished off by <persName>Boyce</persName> himself. <persName>Tucker</persName> was indicted at the Superior Court in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> in April, 1747, for having made instruments for engraving plates to counterfeit the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> new tenor bill and the 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> new tenor bill, and also for having passed two six pence quarters to <persName>Mrs. Clark</persName> of <placeName>Derby</placeName>. <persName>Tucker</persName> pleaded guilty and was sentenced in accordance with law.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Sarah Weed</persName>, <persName>Samuel's wife</persName>, was arrested on April 29, 1747, and taken before Justices <persName>John Hubbard</persName> and <persName>Samuel Bassett</persName>, who proceeded to examine her. She confessed that she knew of <persName>Sam's</persName> making money after the bills were struck. She had, she said, suspected that her husband was having an affair with Widow <persName>Washborn</persName>, and, when she accused him of this, <persName>Sam</persName> took from his pocketbook about ten 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills, newly printed and not signed, and explained
<pb n="88"/>
what was going on. She learned that <persName>Boyce</persName> was at their old place for three days, and, when she insisted that <persName>Boyce</persName> must go or she would complain, <persName>Boyce</persName> went to <persName>Edward Washborn's</persName> where her husband took him meat and cheese. She confessed that she had not done all that was proper, and the court dismissed her.<ref target="#CH6-n25">

               </p>
               <p>The Assembly in May, 1747, appointed Captain <persName>John Fowler</persName> and <persName>Captain Samuel Bassett</persName> as a committee to receive from Sheriff <persName>Samuel Mansfield</persName> of <placeName>New Haven</placeName> County the confiscated estates of <persName>Weed</persName>, <persName>Tucker</persName> and <persName>Wooster</persName> and to sell the same. At this time <persName>Captain Elisha Hall</persName> was appointed to start suits to recover property of <persName>Samuel Weed</persName>, who had apparently given title to it to other persons in order to protect it from seizure.<ref target="#CH6-n26">

               </p>
               <p>On May 12, 1747, <persName>Tucker</persName> and <persName>Wooster</persName> petitioned the Assembly for release from imprisonment. <persName>Wooster</persName> set forth that he had never enriched himself by a penny through counterfeiting, that his property had been purchased with his wife's money, that she was very infirm, that they had several children of whom the youngest was four months old, that his own health was impaired in jail and that his family must become town charges unless he be released to support them. <persName>Tucker</persName> pleaded that his estate, which in large part consisted of his blacksmith's tools, would no more than pay his just debts, that he had a wife and three small children who must, save for an aged father-in-law, who had an elderly and infirm wife, become town charges. Both memorialists were released on condition that each provide a bond of £500 for his good behavior and that each abide within the limits of <placeName>Derby</placeName>.<ref target="#CH6-n27">

and upright behavior" and in October, 1759, asked that he might have restored to him the liberties and privileges which had been lost through his conviction. The Assembly approved his petition and gave him back the right to contract, trade and deal as other inhabitants might do.<ref target="#CH6-n28">

                     <hi rend="sup">29</hi>

               <p>
                  <persName>Weed</persName> made further breaks from jail, once from the <placeName>New Haven</placeName> jail, together with <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>, probably early in October, for on November 6, 1747, he was seized by <persName>Nathaniel Gunn</persName> and returned to prison,<ref target="#CH6-n31">

                  </ref> while on December 26, 1748, Justice <persName>John Humphrey</persName> had him seized in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> and then confined in the jail in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. When <persName>Weed</persName> was taken this last time, he was armed with a pistol and had in his possession a milled dollar and forty-two copper pennies. He was evidently living in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>, for he also had a bed, two goats, a deerskin, a brass skillet, a pair of brass shoe buckles, two chains of silver buttons, a pair of skis, a mare, a saddle and a bridle.<ref target="#CH6-n32">
                     <hi rend="sup">32</hi>

Further, if he should be caught wandering outside of that town, the person who seized him was to be given a reward of £10, while <persName>Weed</persName> was to be given ten stripes on his naked body for so offending.

                  <persName>Weed</persName> sent another memorial to the Assembly on April 30, 1752, requesting permission to go from <placeName>Hartford</placeName> to <placeName>Waterbury</placeName> to see his children and take care of the estate left them by their mother, but his prayer was denied.<ref target="#CH6-n36">

                  </ref> In February, 1756, it came to the attention of the Assembly "that the said <persName>Samuel Weed</persName> hath in divers instances behaved himself contrary to the tenor of the conditions of such bond, and is justly suspected to be confederate with those who counterfeit bills of public credit or put them off knowing them to be such, to the great disquiet of his Majesty's subjects." <persName>Jabez Hamlin</persName>, <persName>John Hubbard</persName> and <persName>Elisha Sheldon</persName> were therefore appointed a committee to examine <persName>Weed</persName> and inquire into his doings and then report back. These gentlemen questioned <persName>Weed</persName> and investigated the matter. They found that he had been to <placeName>Dover</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, on what business they could not discover, but they could obtain no proof against him. They reported, however, that common fame represented him as a very bad and dangerous man and that he corresponded with the counterfeiters of bills.<ref target="#CH6-n37">
                     <hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                  </ref> As <placeName>Dover</placeName> was the headquarters of Owen Sullivan and his associates, it seems likely that "common Fame" was correct with regard to Weed.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Weed</persName> made one more attempt to escape from being restricted to the limits of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. On October 4, 1758, he memorialized the Assembly, setting forth that he wished to become a dresser of deer's leather and in that business travel from town to town, a prayer which the legislators wisely denied.<ref target="#CH6-n38">

               <p>There were other persons who at this time were certainly or probably connected with <persName>Weed</persName> or the money makers in the Oblong. One <persName>Benjamin Barns</persName> of <placeName>Waterbury</placeName> was arrested in that town by Constable <persName>Samuel Scott, Jr.</persName>, on a charge of passing false bills, perhaps obtained from <persName>Weed</persName> or from <placeName>Dover</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>. He was taken to the jail in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>,<ref target="#CH6-n39">
                     <hi rend="sup">39</hi>
                  </ref> but nothing further is known of him. <persName>John Dexter</persName> was followed by officers from Dutchess County, <placeName>New York</placeName>, to <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, where he was arrested and jailed on suspicion of having counterfeited pieces of eight and pistoles, several of which were found on his person. As his crime had been committed in <placeName>New York</placeName>, he was sent there and imprisoned. The minutes of the Supreme Court for this year are lost, so it is not recorded what became of him.<ref target="#CH6-n40">

                  <persName>Abel Clark</persName> of <placeName>Waterbury</placeName> was informed against on September 3, 1748, by <persName>Hezekiah Kilborn</persName> for having on that day passed to Nicholas Ayrault of <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName> a false 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill of the emission of October 11, 1744. <persName>John Chester</persName>, assistant, at once issued a warrant for the arrest of <persName>Clark</persName>, who was speedily apprehended by Constable Oliver Denning of <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName>. At his examination before Chester the prisoner pleaded not guilty but refused to say where he got the false bill. There were found on his person a number of other counterfeit notes, two £2 bills of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, two 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and one 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-30">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXVII</ref>-<ref target="#fig-31">XXVIII</ref>). Bail for Clark was set at £2,000 and he was committed to the jail in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. A month or so in prison induced him to send a memorial to the
<pb n="92"/>
Assembly on September 17, 1748, in which he stated that he, a youth, had been about the beginning of August "bewitched" and "seduced" by <persName>Samuel Weed</persName> to take some £42 in counterfeit bills to pass, with the understanding that he was to keep half the profit. He had put off about half of them when he was arrested. He requested that he be admitted as a King's witness against Weed, a prayer which the Assembly voted to consider in May.</p>
               <p>Now it happened that a fellow prisoner in the <placeName>Hartford</placeName> jail with <persName>Clark</persName> was <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>. A warrant for Bill's arrest had been issued in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> by Justice <persName>John Hubbard</persName> on May 19, 1747, on a complaint to the effect that Bill had lately engraved a plate of the lower left hand quarter of a <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> old tenor bill and also a plate of a 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> new tenor bill and had aided in striking and passing counterfeits. Bill was apprehended at once by <persName>Stephen Hotchkiss</persName> and pleaded not guilty. A 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> new tenor counterfeit bill was, however, found on him and he confessed that he had made it; two pieces of bills were likewise discovered in his possession, as well as an engraving tool. He then admitted that he got the tool and some small pieces of copper and a crucible from <persName>Isaac Doolittle</persName> in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>. He melted the small pieces and formed a plate, which he next engraved. While all alone in the woods in Cheshire, he struck the bill from the plate. He said that he did this because he had nothing else to do and he affirmed that he had never signed or passed any bills. He broke jail, probably early in October, together with <persName>Samuel Weed</persName>, but was later taken and jailed in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. He now escaped from the <placeName>Hartford</placeName> jail and took young <persName>Clark</persName> along with him. Together they went to <placeName>Boston</placeName> and vicinity, where <persName>Clark</persName> seems to have occupied himself with a gang of money makers. By April, 1750, he was desirous of returning to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and therefore wrote to the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Assembly, stating that he wished to confess all and asking liberty to return home to his good parents, whose only son he was. His petition met with the negative vote which it deserved.<ref target="#CH6-n42">

            <p>On Tuesday, September 27, 1748, an exciting scene was enacted at the bottom of the <placeName>Boston</placeName> Common. The best account of the affair is found in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName>Boston</placeName> Evening-Post</hi> of October 3, 1748, and runs as follows:
<q>...one <hi rend="italic">Isaac Jones</hi> having put off some counterfeit Bills, in Imitation of the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>

He made a Stand at the Head of the Stairs, and while he defended his Post, some Persons in the Chamber were engaged in burning the Press and Bills: Several Pieces of the latter, and one almost entire, flew out of the Chimney, and were taken up by the People, and as <hi rend="italic">Jones</hi> was taken by Force sooner than he expected, there were found in the Chamber some Parts of the Press, several Quires of Paper fit for striking of Bills, and a Quantity of Lampblack, Oil &amp;c. for carrying on their Business...</q>
            </p>
            <p>One of his accomplices was taken up and jailed. His bills were described as a cheat which plainly might be discovered at first sight, for they were very pale, and the letters and lines were very uneven and miserably engraved both on the front and back.<ref target="#CH7-n1">

               </ref> Together with others he at once began his counterfeiting again and was detected through the arrest of some passers of his products in <placeName>Hebron</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. In February, 1749, Justice <persName>John Bulkley</persName> of that town discovered that some persons in <placeName>Hebron</placeName> had been connected with <persName>Joseph Bill</persName> in counterfeiting paper money. As a result <persName>David Wilcox. Jr.</persName>, and <persName>Elias Wilcox</persName> were taken into custody and examined by Bulkley and <persName>Joseph Phelps</persName>, another justice of the peace. The prisoners, who were charged with passing false bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, confessed, involved others, and said that one Bryant of <placeName>Boston</placeName> was the one who had undertaken to put off the paper money manufactured by <persName>Joseph</persName> Bill. They further explained that the money was to be passed "on shares."</p>
            <p>It was thought advisable that someone should go to <placeName>Boston</placeName> to alert the authorities there, so Justice <persName>Bulkley</persName> asked one <persName>John Thompson</persName> of <placeName>Hebron</placeName> to undertake the business. After consulting with <persName>Jonathan Trumble</persName> and <persName>Joseph Fowler</persName>, who were of the opinion that the Assembly would reward him, Thompson, accompanied by <persName>David Wilcox</persName>, who was to serve as King's Witness, set out for <placeName>Boston</placeName> toward the end of February in extremely inclement and rainy weather. In <placeName>Boston Thompson</placeName> delivered to the authorities letters from <persName>Trumble</persName> and <persName>Bulkley</persName>.<ref target="#CH7-n4">

               <persName>Jonathan Bryant</persName>, a shingle maker of <placeName>Boston</placeName>, was arrested about March 8 or 9, and in his house were found the following counterfeit bills, ninety-five £3 and nine 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and thirty-two 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>.

On his return

he said he had conversed with the men and then he led the officers there.

            <p>On the last day of March, 1749, <persName>Bill</persName> and <persName>Jones</persName> were in flight from the forces of justice. Led by an Indian squaw, they arrived at an early hour in the morning at the home of <persName>Jedediah Ashcraft</persName> in <persName>Groton</persName>. According to <persName>Ashcraft's</persName> evidence when he was examined—and he was probably far from telling the truth—they pretended that they had come from <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and had sent their horses back by
<pb n="96"/>
someone. <persName>Bill</persName> apparently was going by the name of <persName>Doctor Wilson</persName> and pretending to be a famous physician. Ashcraft described him as a tall man, not thick of body and well dressed. <persName>Jones</persName> went by the name of <persName>Captain Wright</persName> and claimed that he had lost a vessel in the war. They wanted immediate transportation to <placeName>Sag Harbor</placeName>, where <persName>Ashcraft</persName> landed them and received, as he said at first, an £8 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill from <persName>Wilson</persName>. Later, however, he broke down and wept, admitting that he had lied and confessing that he had been given a £10/10 bill, apparently a counterfeit. He added the information that his passengers went to <placeName>South Hampton</placeName>, where they attended meeting and were on the Sabbath at the tavern at Zeb Howel's.</p>
            <p>A warrant for <persName>Ashcraft's</persName> arrest had been issued at <placeName>New London</placeName> on May 5, 1749, and <persName>Daniel Collins</persName>, Deputy Sheriff of <placeName>New London</placeName> County, apprehended him at <placeName>
                  <persName>Groton</persName>
               </placeName> on May 8. The same day he was examined by <persName>Daniel Coit, J.P</persName>, who questioned him sharply about a letter, addressed to <persName>Mr. Willet Larabe</persName> living in <placeName>Norwich</placeName> Long Society, which was found by <persName>Collins</persName> in <persName>Ashcraft's</persName> possession. <persName>Ashcraft</persName> explained that it was given him by "Wilson." It appeared to Justice <persName>Coit</persName> that <persName>Ashcraft</persName> had concealed, nourished and conveyed away counterfeiters and on <placeName>Long Island</placeName> had passed a false £10/10 bill to <persName>Nathan Fordham</persName>. The magistrate therefore bound <persName>Ashcraft</persName> over to the next Superior Court to be held in September, 1750, but finally he was released on bail of £1,000 furnished by <persName>Ashcraft</persName>, Parke Avery of <placeName>Groton</placeName> and <persName>James Tulley</persName> of <placeName>New London</placeName>.<ref target="#CH7-n11">

            <p>The court records do not explain the content of the letter addressed to Willet Larabe and delivered to <persName>Ashcraft</persName> by <persName>Joseph Bill</persName> nor do they indicate why Justice <persName>Coit</persName> questioned his prisoner about the document. It seems, however, safe to assume that there was some message about counterfeiting and that <persName>Larabe</persName> was one of <persName>Bill's</persName> gang or at least in the same business, for early in November 1751, <persName>Willet Larabe</persName> was convicted at the superior court of King's County, <placeName>Rhode</placeName>

Island, for passing several counterfeit twenty shilling new tenor bills of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>. He was sentenced to stand in the pillory for half an hour, to have both ears cropped, to be branded with R on each cheek with a hot iron, to be imprisoned for one month, to pay double damages to the persons injured by his counterfeit bills and the costs of prosecution, and to forfeit the remainder of his estate, both real and personal, for the use of the colony. The corporal punishment was executed at <placeName>South Kingston</placeName> on 7 November.<ref target="#CH7-n12">

               <persName>Ashcraft</persName> was before the Superior Court at <placeName>Norwich</placeName> on March 27, 1751, charged with aiding in counterfeiting bills. Fortunately for him, the one thing which could be proved against him and to which he had confessed was the passing of a counterfeit bill. This, however, had been done on <placeName>Long Island</placeName> and was not actionable in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, so no one appeared to prosecute him and he was freed by proclamation on payment of costs.<ref target="#CH7-n13">

            <p>The passers of <persName>Joseph Bill's</persName> paper money were numerous in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>New York</placeName>, and, as has been stated above, the whole affair came to light through the detection of a number of the rascals by <persName>John Bulkley</persName> in February, 1749. Of the gang were <persName>Amos</persName> and <persName>Timothy Fuller</persName> of <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, <persName>Samuel Ingham</persName>, <persName>Aaron Wilcox</persName> and <persName>David Wilcox</persName>, all of <placeName>Hebron</placeName>, and probably <persName>Alpheus Wickwire</persName> of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>. <persName>David Wilcox</persName>, as has been seen, had at his examination made a clean breast of the matter and fully cooperated with the authorities by turning King's evidence and thus escaping prosecution. One of his friends, <persName>Samuel Ingham</persName>, had shared a room with <persName>David</persName> at the home of <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Gale</persName>. In a chest in the room of her lodgers <persName>Mrs. Gale</persName> discovered a letter which indicated that Ingham was passing counterfeits. He was arrested and was examined by <persName>Bulkley</persName>, an assistant, at <placeName>Colchester</placeName> on March 7, 1749. It appeared that <persName>Ingham</persName> received from <persName>David Wilcox</persName> a £3 <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> counterfeit bill (<ref target="#fig-34">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXXI</ref>-<ref target="#fig-35">XXXII</ref>) and passed it off to a <persName>Mr. White</persName> at <placeName>Killingworth</placeName> and a similar note to one Rossiter of the same town, while <persName>Mr. Gale</persName> had also received similar false bills from him. <persName>Jonathan</persName> Factor in <placeName>Branford</placeName> secured one of these bills from Gale and sent it to Captain Edmund Ward in <placeName>Guilford</placeName>, who turned it over to <persName>Samuel Lynde</persName>, assistant.

He was apprehended on March 30 and examined the next day and also on April 3. At first he maintained that he did not know where he got the false £3 bill (<ref target="#fig-32">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXIX</ref>-<ref target="#fig-33">XXX</ref>) but later admitted he had obtained it from <persName>Elias Wilcox</persName> in exchange for a deerskin. He confessed that he had passed another of the £3 bills to <persName>John Alden</persName> in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>.

forgotten when asked about point after point. It seems that he had ridden from Providence to <placeName>Voluntown</placeName> in company with some woman to whom he had, it was believed, spoken freely about counterfeiting and his own part in such criminal activities. At the end of December, 1748, one "Carpendor," doubtless <persName>Carpenter</persName>, had been at his home and he, <persName>Wickwire</persName>, admitted having had a £10/10 bill. He seemed on this and subsequent examinations to be guilty, so that on April 8 he was bound over to appear at the Superior Court to be held at <placeName>New London</placeName> in September and was released on a bail bond of £1,000 furnished by himself, <persName>Urian Hosmond</persName> (<persName>Urian Hosmer</persName>?) and <persName>Ebenezer Barstow</persName>.<ref target="#CH7-n26">

On September 19 he broke out of prison, and Sheriff <persName>Joseph Hollingshead</persName>, who had learned that the fugitive's real name was probably <persName>Amos Fuller</persName>, offered a reward of ten pounds for his capture.

               </hi>, published in <placeName>New London</placeName> in 1750, contains an "Act against Counterfeiting Bills of public Credit, Coins, or Currencies; and emitting, and passing Bills, or Notes on private Credit: and to prevent Injustice in passing Counterfeit Bills."<ref target="#CH8-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> The act reduced the reward to an informer from £20 to £10 but otherwise did not change the earlier laws on counterfeiting. Toward the close of the act, however, issuing of bills to take the place of money was forbidden in these terms:</p>
            <p>Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person, Society, Number of Persons, or Company within this Colony, shall presume to Strike, Emit, or put Out any Bills of Credit of the Nature, or Tenor of the Bills of Credit in this Government, on any Fund, or Credit of any Person, or Persons, Society, or Company, to be used, and improved as a General Currency, or Medium of Trade, as, and in lieu of Money, such Person, or Persons, Society, or Company, and Every of them shall be subject to the same Pains, Penalties, and Forfeitures, and be punished in the same Manner, as those are by this Act subjected to who shall be Convicted of Forging, or Counterfeiting the Bills of Credit Emitted by this Government.</p>
            <p>And that if any Person, or Persons in this Colony, shall Utter, Vend, or Pass any Bills, or Notes, or any other Currencies whatsoever, which either have been, or hereafter shall be Struck, Emitted, or put Out to be used, as aforesaid, on the Fund, or Credit of any private Person, or Persons, Society, or Company whatsoever, either in this, or the Neighbouring Governments; he, or they so Offending, shall Forfeit double the Sum, or Value expressed in such Bill, Note, or other Currency. The One Half thereof to him, or them that shall Prosecute the same to Effect; and the Other Half to the Town Treasury, when the Trial shall be before an

Assistant, or Justice; and to the County Treasury when it shall be before the County Court.</p>
            <p>And all Grand-Jurors, and Constables are hereby Required to make Presentment of all Breaches of this Act.</p>
            <p>The decade from 1750 to 1760 showed an enormous increase in counterfeiting and passing, most of which can be traced to the influence of what was called the "Money Club" at <placeName>Dover</placeName> in Dutchess County, <placeName>New York</placeName>, "where," as the <hi rend="italic">New-York Gazette</hi>: <hi rend="italic">or, the Weekly Post-Boy</hi> of March 15, 1756, put it, "'tis said a large Gang of Villains have harboured for a considerable Time past, few of which but have a Crop or a Brand-Mark upon them, as it is a Sort of Disgrace for one reputed honest to be seen among them."</p>

               <p>Justice <persName>John Williams</persName> of <placeName>Sharon</placeName>, on a complaint made by <persName>Samuel Elmer</persName> of that town, issued, on November 13, 1752, a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Force of Dover, <placeName>New York</placeName>, whom Elmer charged with having passed to him a counterfeit £3 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill. At first Force pleaded not guilty when he had been arrested and was taken before the magistrate for examination. Later, however, he expressed a desire to be accepted as King's Witness against several other persons. His bail was set at £200, which was furnished by <persName>David Hamilton</persName>, <persName>Daniel Parker</persName> and <persName>Samuel Elmer</persName>. On June 12, 1753, Justice Williams wrote to <persName>Samuel Pettibone</persName>, the King's Attorney, informing him that Force had testified in a court at Poughkeepsie against several persons, of whom two, Captain <persName>Joseph Boyce</persName> and <persName>Joseph Hicks</persName> had been convicted.

               <p>Captain <persName>John Payson</persName> of <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> on December 28, 1752, complained to <persName>William Chandler, J.P.</persName>, of <placeName>Killingly</placeName> against one <persName>George Kimball</persName> of <placeName>Newbury</placeName> in <placeName>Essex County</placeName>. <persName>Payson</persName> charged that he had received in trade of <persName>Kimball</persName> three counterfeit 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. new tenor bills of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>. On a writ issued by the magistrate, Isaac Dana of <placeName>Pomfret</placeName>, Deputy Sheriff of <placeName>Windham</placeName> County, arrested <persName>Kimball</persName>, who was taken before Justice <persName>Chandler</persName> to be examined. The prisoner said that his name was <persName>John George</persName> and that he belonged to <placeName>Hampton</placeName>, <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>. He admitted having knowingly passed the false paper money, which he said he had obtained from Dr. Sam Dusten at Haverhill for a horse, bridle and saddle. He had left two of the counterfeits with the wife of <persName>Mr. Kimball</persName> of <placeName>Haverhill</placeName> and had passed five of them in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. He added that he was to receive a parcel of £3/10 bills from one <persName>Bill</persName>, and he asked to be admitted as King's Evidence. His bail was set at £500, and, as he could not obtain a bond,
<pb n="105"/>
he was committed to the jail in <placeName>Windham</placeName>. In February, 1753, he escaped because of the weakness of the building but was pursued and taken again by <persName>Eleazer Fitch</persName>, Sheriff of <placeName>Windham</placeName> County. Soon, however, though now secured in irons, he managed to break out again and on this occasion made good his escape despite a hot pursuit by Sheriff <persName>Fitch</persName>.<ref target="#CH8-n4">

He was bound over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in March, 1753, and was released on bail of £200 furnished by himself, <persName>Noah Dewey</persName> and <persName>Robert Avery</persName>, all of <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>.

The man referred to was <persName>John Campbell</persName>, and his arrest came about when Justice <persName>Jonathan Hoyt</persName> issued a warrant for the arrest of the vagrant. On August 16, 1753, a person dressed in a white frock and trousers, who refused to tell his name, was brought before the magistrate. A search revealed in his possession thirteen dollars, fifty-one half dollars and eighty-eight quarters, all presumably counterfeits. <persName>John Campbell</persName>, for such was his name, was not admitted to bail and was jailed until August 21, 1753, when he was brought before the Superior Court at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> and indicted for having, about July 20 at <placeName>Stamford</placeName>, counterfeited milled dollars and half and quarter dollars. He was tried, convicted and sentenced to serve a term of six months in prison and to pay costs of £12/6/6. In

February, 1754, when his term had been served, the Superior Court ordered that he be released if he paid the costs and an additional £4/1/6 for certain other charges. Otherwise he was to be sold for a reasonable time to pay the costs and charges.<ref target="#CH8-n7">

All three had been passing counterfeit £4 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills of the emission of 1750 and were charged, Mace with passing such a bill on August 20 to <persName>Pennel Bowen</persName>, a hatter in <placeName>Woodstock</placeName>, Cogswell with passing such a bill on August 18 to William Chandler, shipjoiner of <placeName>Woodstock</placeName>, and Wiley with passing such a bill on August 15 to <persName>John Payson</persName>, gentleman. Warrants were issued, and all three suspects were arrested, Cogswell by Constable Daniel Child of <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> and Wiley by Deputy Sheriff <persName>John Chamberlin</persName>.

               <p>By November 22, 1753, three inhabitants of <placeName>Killingly</placeName>, <persName>William Shapley</persName>, husbandman, <persName>Jedediah Cady</persName>, husbandman, and an Indian named <persName>Jeremiah Lisha</persName> were under arrest for counterfeiting. Constable <persName>Samuel Porter</persName> had complained that Shapley was involved in counterfeiting or passing £4 bills of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> and £8 bills of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and had taken him up on a warrant issued by Justice <persName>William Chandler</persName>. <persName>Cady</persName> had been informed against to <persName>Chandler</persName> by <persName>Henry Bowen</persName> of <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> and arrested by <persName>John Corbin, Jr.</persName>, a sheriff's deputy. Constable <persName>Hezekiah Cutler</persName> had complained to <persName>Joseph Cady, J.P.</persName>, against <persName>Lisha</persName> for aiding <persName>Jedediah Cady</persName> in passing false <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills of the emission of 1750 and he had been apprehended by <persName>Nathaniel Wales, Jr.</persName>, a sheriff's deputy.</p>
               <p>At his examination he stated that he had obtained twelve dollars and £150 in paper money from <persName>William Carpenter</persName> of <placeName>New Salem</placeName> and had passed two £8 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills of the emission of 1741 to <persName>Widow Joannah Utter</persName> of <placeName>Killingly</placeName> but he had not known the money was false. He was indicted at the Superior Court at <placeName>Windham</placeName> on De-

He pleaded not guilty, though at his examination before Justice <persName>Chandler</persName> he had admitted his guilt. He was tried, convicted and sentenced in accordance with law. An order was issued on January 2, 1754, that before the end of that month he be cropped, branded with C, sent to the workhouse and deprived of all his estate. On January 7 Sheriff <persName>Fitch</persName> performed the cropping and branding but could discover no estate.<ref target="#CH8-n13">

               <p>
                  <persName>Cady's</persName> home was remote from travel and distant from neighbors, a fact which probably induced <persName>Sullivan</persName> to seek his aid. In any event, <persName>Cady</persName> permitted <persName>Sullivan</persName> and his associates (<persName>Jeremiah Lisha</persName> told of one <persName>Bacon</persName>, <persName>Captain Cogswell</persName>, <persName>Sullivan</persName> and <persName>Jacob Wiley</persName> being present at <persName>Cady's</persName> house) to use the chamber in his house for their counterfeiting. When they had finished striking off bills, they gave <persName>Cady</persName> about £400 of the money, which he put in a box and buried in the ground. Later he took it out and burned all the paper money. From jail on May 8, 1754, he petitioned the Assembly for release, and a considerable number of fellow townsmen sent in a testimonial concerning his good care of his aged father and mother and his fine reputation before he was drawn into the counterfeiting scheme. The Assembly decided to release <persName>Cady</persName>, who was then about thirty years of age, on condition that he pay all costs of prosecution and find surety in the amount of £50 for his good behavior for life and the peaceable surrender of his body to the sheriff if so required. Further he was to go to <placeName>Killingly</placeName> and reside within the limits of the town, where he might carry on all lawful business.<ref target="#CH8-n14">

               <p>The Indian, <persName>Lisha</persName>, at his examination on November 22, 1753, before Justice <persName>Joseph Cady</persName>, pleaded guilty and told how <persName>Jedediah Cady</persName> had given him £80 in bad money to pass, with the understanding that he keep half the profits. He added that he had passed it all in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> at <persName>Smithfield</persName> and <persName>Narragansett</persName> and that he had sent £40 to <persName>Jedediah</persName> by <persName>Elisha Herinton</persName> of <persName>Smithfield</persName>. He had, moreover, recently obtained £48 in bills from <persName>Jedediah</persName> and passed them all. He added the names of the persons to whom he had uttered the bills, but these persons denied having ever changed any money with <persName>Lisha</persName>, so it would seem that his imagination had been given free rein. Apparently the King's Attorney was of this opinion, for he decided that there was not sufficient evidence against the prisoner, so the court ordered him released on payment of costs of £6/5/–. <persName>Lisha</persName>, unhappily, had no money, so he offered to serve to pay the costs, and it was finally agreed that he serve <persName>Eliphalet Dyer</persName>, <persName>Nathaniel Wales</persName> and <persName>Isaac Warner</persName>, all of <placeName>Windham</placeName>, for two years, in return for which they paid his costs.<ref target="#CH8-n15">

               <p>In September, 1753, <persName>John Clark</persName>, alias <persName>Stoddard</persName>, a mason of <placeName>Stratford</placeName>, secured from the "Money Club in Dover" a large quantity of counterfeit £8 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> old tenor bills. He then approached <persName>Benjamin Beardslee</persName> of <placeName>Stratford</placeName>, son of <persName>Josiah Beardslee</persName>, and induced him to take eight of the bills to pass, and of them <persName>Benjamin</persName> uttered four. Soon <persName>Clark</persName> went away to get another parcel of bills, and during <persName>Clark's</persName> absence <persName>Beardslee</persName>, thinking over what he had done, burned the remaining four bills and then bought back the four which he had passed and burned them also. When <persName>Clark</persName> returned, <persName>Benjamin</persName> refused to take more bills from him, so <persName>Clark</persName>, it seems, got <persName>Israel Beardslee</persName>, 2nd, and <persName>John Beardslee</persName> to pass his bogus money for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Clark</persName> and <persName>Israel</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Beardslee</persName> were complained against by Constable <persName>Ebenezer</persName> Hinman of <placeName>Stratford</placeName> and were all arrested and
<pb n="111"/>
brought before <persName>Samuel Adams, J.P.</persName>, on December 3, 1753. <persName>Clark</persName> was committed to jail, <persName>Israel</persName> was released on bail and <persName>Benjamin</persName> was dismissed. When <persName>Clark</persName> was arrested, twenty-six £8 bills of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> of the emission of February 2, 1741, were found in his pocket. At the Superior Court held at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> on February 19, 1754, he was indicted for having in October 10, 1753, in <placeName>Stratford</placeName> uttered to <persName>Benjamin Beardslee</persName> a counterfeit <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of the emission of 1741. <persName>Clark</persName> pleaded guilty and was sentenced in accordance with law.<ref target="#CH8-n16">

               </p>
               <p>After suffering corporal punishment <persName>Clark</persName> was returned to jail but soon broke out and made good his escape. Counterfeiters soon approached him but he refused to join them and gave information against them. His position was, indeed, a difficult one, for he was subject to arrest at any moment and was under sentence of imprisonment for life. In addition he was exposed to the hatred and malice of the counterfeiters against whom he had turned and was worried about the future of his wife and two small children. In these circumstances he petitioned the Assembly in October, 1754, to give him liberty to go about his lawful business, a request which was seconded by Justice <persName>Adams</persName>, who stated that <persName>Clark</persName> had been cooperative and well behaved of late. The Assembly lent a receptive ear and granted the liberty requested with the proviso that <persName>Clark</persName> remain within the limits of <placeName>Stratford</placeName> and that if he left the bounds of that town his privileges would be forfeited.<ref target="#CH8-n17">

                  <persName>Benjamin Beardslee</persName>, who had at first been released as innocent by Justice <persName>Adams</persName>, some three or four weeks later returned to the magistrate and told him all, involving <persName>John Beardslee</persName>, who, until then, had not been suspected. <persName>John</persName> was taken up, charged with procuring counterfeit bills to be made and uttering them, was examined by Justice <persName>David Rowland</persName>, and released on bail of £50 furnished by himself and <persName>Francis Hawley</persName> of <placeName>Stratford</placeName>. When he was
<pb n="112"/>
called at the Superior Court in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> on February 19, 1754, <persName>John</persName> did not appear and his bond was declared forfeited.<ref target="#CH8-n18">

               <p>
                  <persName>Israel Beardslee</persName>, as has been stated above, had been brought before Justice <persName>Adams</persName>. The complaint against him, lodged by Constable <persName>Hinman</persName> of <placeName>Stratford</placeName>, was that he had been passing counterfeit <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of the emission of 1741. <persName>Adams</persName> released his prisoner on bail of £300, provided by <persName>Israel Beardslee</persName> himself, his father, Josiah, and his brother, <persName>Benjamin Israel's</persName> own account of his troubles is as follows: he let <persName>John Clark</persName> take a mare and saddle of his to sell when <persName>Clark</persName> went off to <placeName>Dover</placeName> to work there as a mason. When <persName>Clark</persName> returned, he gave <persName>Israel</persName> £136 for the horse and saddle, all in £8 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills. <persName>Israel</persName> had some doubts about the paper money but <persName>Clark</persName> insisted that the bills were good, and such competent persons as <persName>Captain Hyde</persName> and <persName>Captain Hawley</persName> of the Society of <persName>Ripton</persName> and <persName>Mr. Gibb</persName> and Captain <persName>Edward Ellen</persName> of <placeName>Milford</placeName> viewed the notes and pronounced them genuine. When, however, some bills were passed and scrupled, <persName>Israel</persName> tried to buy them back. He was, however, soon arrested and when released on bail intended to stand trial but was foolishly dissuaded by friends and relatives, including his father-in-law, <persName>Samuel</persName> French of <placeName>Stratford</placeName>, to whom Israel had passed two of the false bills. An appeal made to the Assembly by <persName>Israel</persName> met with success, for on May 12, 1755, it was ordered that his forfeited bond of £300 be chancered down to £50.<ref target="#CH8-n19">

               <p>
                  <persName>Benjamin Beardslee</persName>, who had finally made a full confession to Justice <persName>Adams</persName>, had been complained of, about January 26, 1754, to Justice <persName>David Rowland</persName> by <persName>Lyman Hall</persName> of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>. <persName>Benjamin</persName>, when arrested, pleaded guilty and was released in bail of £50 to appear at the next Superior Court in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>. He expected, on the basis of encouragement given him by Justice <persName>Adams</persName>, to be admitted as King's Evidence but that prospect evaporated when <persName>Clark</persName> pleaded guilty and another forfeited his bond. So <persName>Benjamin</persName> did not risk appearing in court, and the bond furnished by him and his father was declared
<pb n="113"/>
forfeited. <persName>Benjamin</persName>. appealed to the Assembly in May, 1755, for release from the bond but without success. A year later, however, the Assembly ordered that the amount be cut from £50 to £25 if he would pay that sum, plus all costs, to <persName>Robert Walker</persName>, the King's Attorney for <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> County.<ref target="#CH8-n20">

               <p>In December, 1753, <persName>Zephaniah Stevens</persName>, described as head of a tribe of money makers, persuaded <persName>Peter Smith</persName> of <placeName>Norwalk</placeName> to admit him to his house, There, for some three days in December, <persName>Stevens</persName>, aided by <persName>Smith</persName> and <persName>Eliphalet Sloson</persName>, struck off £8 bills of the latest emission of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>. During a temporary absence of <persName>Stevens</persName> and <persName>Sloson</persName>, <persName>Smith</persName> became either frightened or remorseful and threw some of the bills in the fire. Then, on the advice of <persName>Ichabod Doolittle</persName>, he turned <persName>Stevens</persName> out of the house, though permitting him to take with him the rest of the bills.

Each was bound over to the next Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> and each was released on bail of £100, furnished for <persName>Smith</persName> by <persName>Peter</persName> and <persName>Nehemiah Smith</persName> and for <persName>Sloson</persName> by <persName>Eliphalet Sloson</persName> and <persName>John</persName> Fancher of <placeName>Stamford</placeName>. <persName>Smith</persName> forfeited his bond by not appearing at the court in February, 1754, but in October was successful in an attempt to induce the Assembly to have his bond chancered down to £25 on condition that he pay that sum at once and also a further £25 with the costs of the suit on the bond. <persName>Sloson</persName>, as there was not sufficient time to try his case at the February session, was bound over to the August session, when the grand jury returned his indictment ignoramus and he was released on payment of costs of £13/4/6.<ref target="#CH8-n21">

                  </hi>
               </head>
               <p>On January 25, 1754, <persName>David Sandford</persName> of <placeName>Salem</placeName> in the Oblong in the Province of <placeName>New York</placeName> set out from <placeName>Waterbury</placeName> for <placeName>Woodbury</placeName> in the company of two other travellers, <persName>Barnabas Merwin</persName> of <placeName>Wallingford</placeName> and <persName>Elisha Hall, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>South Kingston</placeName>, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>. <persName>Sandford</persName> told the others that unless he could change a 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bill he could neither eat nor drink. When they arrived that evening at the tavern of <persName>Isaac Brounson</persName>, <persName>Sandford</persName> pretended to be intoxicated and sought to get the landlady to change the money but she refused. Another <persName>patron</persName> of the tavern, however, <persName>James Lewis</persName> of <persName>Bateman's</persName> Patent, changed the bill.</p>
               <p>As the travellers proceeded on their way, Sandford spoke of being well acquainted with <persName>Jacob Mace</persName> and also of knowing where plates for counterfeiting were. When Merwin and Hall informed him that they suspected he had been putting off counterfeits, he bade them say nothing and go with him, for he would make them gentlemen and put a thousand pounds in their pockets. Then, as they approached <persName>Hurd's</persName> tavern in <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>, he said he was going to put off some more money and offered to bear their expenses, threatening, however, to kill them if they said a word to expose him. The next day he offered a false 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bill to pay the reckoning.</p>
               <p>In <placeName>Waterbury</placeName> on January 25 <persName>Sandford</persName> had passed nine 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bills and one of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., all of the issue of December, 1737. One of his victims, <persName>Joseph Hopkins</persName> of <placeName>Waterbury</placeName>, on January 26 made a complaint against <persName>Sandford</persName> to <persName>Thomas Clark, J.P.</persName>, in <placeName>Waterbury</placeName>, and <persName>Sandford</persName> was arrested the same day. When questioned by Justice <persName>Clark</persName>, <persName>Sandford</persName> said he had received the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills from <persName>Nathaniel Nichols</persName> of <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> and the 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill from an <persName>Irishman</persName> named <persName>Sullivan.</persName> He admitted that both these men were counterfeiters and that they had lived in his house, where they had the liberty of a chamber for carrying on their business of counterfeiting. He added that one <persName>James Brown</persName> told him that <persName>Nichols</persName> had passed two 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bills from the same counterfeit plate, one in <placeName>Redding</placeName> and the other

in <placeName>Bedford</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>. <persName>Sandford</persName> was committed to the jail in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> and at the Superior Court held in that town of February 26 he was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced in accordance with law.<ref target="#CH8-n27">

               <p>From a complaint sent to the Assembly in May, 1754, by a large number of inhabitants of <persName>Ridgefield</persName> and <placeName>Norwalk</placeName>, something is learned of his subsequent activities. After previously being imprisoned in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, he had broken out and fled to his family in <placeName>Salem</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, where he assembled a gang at his house and there counterfeited the bills of <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and also Spanish dollars. In the fall of 1753 he had kept in his home <persName>Owen Sullivan</persName>, a notorious money maker, and together they had stamped a large quantity of <placeName>New York</placeName> bills.</p>
               <p>About April 26, 1754, <persName>Sandford</persName> and his gang planned to rescue some neat cattle which had been attached for debt but the officer in charge guarded the cattle with some twenty men, and the attempt of the desperados failed. The same night, however, they tried to set fire to a barn where the cattle were being kept under lock and key but the evil design came to naught, since a guard had been set and he fired at the counterfeiters. These villains immediately set fire to some fences in a neighboring field, and a high wind fanned the flames. While the people were trying to quench them, <persName>Sandford</persName> and his followers set new fires on the other side of the field.</p>
               <p>A week later, at dead of night, the counterfeiters came to the Parish of <persName>Wilton</persName> to the home of <persName>Mr. Deforest</persName>, who had the attached cattle in his keeping, cut the tongue out of one of his cows and set a brisk fire near the house. Had the blaze not been discovered in the nick of time, both the house and barn would have been consumed and probably also the people in the house.</p>
               <p>Two of <persName>Sandford</persName>'s active abettors were <persName>Jacob Wiley</persName> and <persName>Joseph Nichols</persName>. <persName>Nichols</persName> had been convicted of forgery and both men had been prosecuted for counterfeiting. The rogues were bent on taking revenge on those who had been instrumental in exposing their villainies. With this intent <persName>Nichols</persName> came to the back side of the house
<pb n="118"/>
which had been mentioned in the deed he had forged and, looking in at the window, he asked his daughter, who was busy weaving, why she stayed there. When she replied that it was to finish the cloth, <persName>Nichols</persName> told her that she would pay for it if she did, as he, <persName>Sandford</persName> and <persName>Wiley</persName> would burn or destroy the house that night. He then ordered her to give him all the shot in the house and, when she would not at first comply, he pointed a pistol at her and forced her to do his bidding. He told her, moreover, that he would certainly kill her if she told of his design.</p>
               <p>The poor girl was terrified but ventured to tell a woman in the neighborhood, and she promptly made all known, so that a watch was set. The watch saw <persName>Sandford</persName>'s dog and suspected the criminals were near. Presently fires broke out at some distance from the dwelling and, before they were put out, considerable damage was done. <persName>Nichols</persName> had further told his daughter that he planned to burn the house of <persName>Samuel</persName> Olmstead, the justice of the peace who had prosecuted him.</p>
               <p>The people of <persName>Ridgefield</persName> and <placeName>Norwalk</placeName> were incensed at such outrages. In their petition to the Assembly for relief they pointed out that the desperate fellows went armed in defiance of all law and government. <persName>Sandford</persName>, for example, showed one man three pistols and another which he carried loaded, and swore to be the death of the first man who should venture to lay hands upon him.</p>
               <p>Despite this bravado, a number of young men of <persName>Ridgefield</persName>, with the aid of the Constable of <placeName>Salem</placeName>, captured <persName>Sandford</persName> without any bloodshed, and their prisoner was remanded to the <placeName>New Haven</placeName> jail, from which he had escaped before. On his way back to prison he "Spoke terrible words in Defiance of all the Goals in the Colony." The memorialists stated that the damage caused by fires set by the gang was computed to exceed £4,000, while the loss of time and labor by people watching and working to save their property in this time of drought was estimated at £100 a day. In case <persName>Sandford</persName> escaped again, he would be more dangerous than before.</p>
               <p>The petitioners prayed that he be kept secure in jail and also all the others who might be taken. Their capture was considered a
<pb n="119"/>
dangerous undertaking and one not to be accomplished without the shedding of blood. In the gang were Nichols, <persName>Wiley</persName>, one of <persName>Sandford</persName>'s sons and others, all of whom were distressing people by setting fires and lurking armed about the borders of <persName>Ridgefield</persName>.</p>
               <p>In keeping with a report made by a committee of the Assembly appointed to study the matter, that body in May, 1754, ordered the King's Attorney to see that <persName>Nichols</persName> and his band were taken and that officers of all counties help him and that he secure as much assistance as was needed. The Assembly likewise went on record in commendation of <persName>Abigail Nichols</persName>, <persName>Joseph Nichols'</persName> daughter. Their resolution reads:</p>
               <p>This Assembly, observing the prudent and good Conduct of <persName>Abigail Nichols</persName> of <placeName>Ridgfield</placeName> and her just attachment to publick Virtue and the common Good, when under violent Temptation to the contrary, in Disclosing the wicked Design of certain convicted Desperados and Banditti in said Town, and the special Danger she is in, of becoming a Victim to the merciless Rage of those detestable Miscreants; as incidentally represented in the Memorial of some of the Inhabitants of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Town now before this Assembly, think proper to manifest their high Approbation of the Conduct of the said <persName>Abigail Nichols</persName>; and recommend her to the special Care and Protection of the Civil Authority; and the charitable Compassion of all true Lovers of their Country.<ref target="#CH8-n28">

               <p>In the summer of 1754 a number of passers of counterfeits were detected in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> County. About July 14 Sheriff <persName>Oliver Wolcott</persName> complained to <persName>Ebenezer Marsh, J.P.</persName>, that <persName>William Mallory</persName> of Kent, <persName>John Clothier, Jr.</persName>, of <persName>Cornwall</persName> and <persName>Odel Squire</persName> of <persName>Cornwall</persName> had passed, about May 9, some false <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills of the emission of 1741. <persName>Squire</persName> at his examination before Justice <persName>Marsh</persName> on the charge of having passed an £8 bill (<ref target="#fig-36">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXXIII</ref>-<ref target="#fig-37">XXXIV</ref>) to <persName>Jacob Brownson</persName> of <placeName>New Milford</placeName>, who in turn had passed it to
<pb n="120"/>
                  <persName>Captain Wolcott</persName>, said he was in partnership with Clothier and he told of having sold in April to Captain <persName>Joseph Boyce</persName> a yoke of oxen for £118. Odel was bound over to the next term of the Superior Court, committed to jail and released on July 24 on bail furnished by himself and <persName>Reuben Squire</persName> of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>. Clothier was also taken up and examined by Justice <persName>Marsh</persName> on July 18 on the charge that he had passed two counterfeit £8 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills, one of them to <persName>Joseph Pangborn, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>. Clothier's story was that he had obtained one such bill from <persName>Silas Chapman</persName>—who took it back—and another from <persName>Mr. Hazzard</persName> of <placeName>Stratford</placeName> for canoes, while he had also received from a <persName>Mr. Atwater</persName> or a <persName>Mr. Hamblin</persName> a new £8 <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> bill. Clothier was also bound over to the August, 1754, term of the Superior Court in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName>.<ref target="#CH8-n29">

               <p>At this session of the court both men were indicted, pleaded not guilty, and, as there was no time for their trials, were bound over to the August, 1755 term of the court. They were released on bail of £130 each, furnished for Clothier by <persName>Phineas Spaulding</persName> and <persName>John Clothier, Sr.</persName>, both of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, and for Squire by <persName>Reuben</persName> Squire of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> and <persName>Joseph Pangborn, Sr.</persName>, of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>.<ref target="#CH8-n30">

                  <persName>Odel Squire's</persName> sureties in October, 1755, petitioned the Assembly, asking to be relieved from making good their bond which had been declared forfeited. Their prayer was granted on condition that they pay all costs and charges that had already arisen in <persName>Squire's</persName> case and

It was charged that about June, 1754, at <placeName>New Milford</placeName> he had passed to <persName>Paul Welch, Jr.</persName>, a false £8 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bill of the emission of 1741.

August, at which he was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced in accordance with law. On May 7, 1755, his father, <persName>David Owen, Sr.</persName>, of <placeName>New Milford</placeName> petitioned the Assembly, stating that his son, then about twenty-one years of age, would like to be released from jail to enlist without premium in the army and allow deduction to be made from his pay to satisfy all costs (which amounted to £15/19/9 as far as charges for prosecution were concerned).

               <p>Owen also, it appears, got <persName>Samuel Cogswell</persName> of <placeName>New Milford</placeName> into difficulties, for in September, 1754, Owen brought him some molds and desired him to run some half and quarter pieces of eight out of pewter. <persName>Samuel</persName> ran ten of each in the shop while the folks were all gone from home and cracked the crucible by melting pewter in it. The pieces were put into a bag and the bag was hidden in a hole in the jamb, except for two pieces, of which one was given to <persName>Elisha Wood</persName> and the other was in the pocket of a pair of leather breeches hung up in the house, where one Ferris found the counterfeit coin. <persName>Cogswell</persName> was arrested, examined by Justices <persName>Samuel Canfield</persName> and <persName>Paul Welch</persName> and bound over to appear at the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> in August, 1755. On November 1, 1754, he was released on bail of £50 furnished by <persName>Daniel Bowman</persName> of <persName>Kent</persName> and <persName>Micah Palmer</persName> of <placeName>New Milford</placeName>. He was indicted in August, 1755, tried, convicted and sentenced to receive thirty-nine stripes and to pay costs of prosecution amounting to £17/8/6.<ref target="#CH8-n38">

               <p>In December, 1754, <persName>Caesar Trick</persName>, a mulatto "famous for Stealing Commiting Burgalary and almost all other Crimes and Misdemeanors,"<ref target="#CH8-n40">
                     <hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                  </ref> was indicted for counterfeiting in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName> on December 1 four £2 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills, four £2 <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> bills, five 2/6 <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> bills (<ref target="#fig-23">

He had for some time lived in the wilderness "Armed with weapons and Instruments of terror and Death to Prevent his being taken and brought to Justice and was a Common Nusance to ye Publick." Among his other offences Caesar had stolen a mare from <persName>Abner Hyde</persName> of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>. <persName>Nathaniel Huntington</persName> of that town determined to rid the community of Caesar. Having obtained a writ in favor of Hyde against Caesar for the theft of the mare, <persName>Huntington</persName> pursued and captured the mulatto. The Superior Court in <placeName>Windham</placeName> in February, 1753, gave judgment against Caesar for £24 damages and £9/—/6 costs and assigned him to Hyde for eight years of service to pay the judgment. Huntington paid the money to Hyde and, having thus gotten legal possession of Caesar for eight years, he jailed him in irons until he could arrange to send him out of the country. Caesar, however, "according to his wonted practis Soon Broak Prison and Run away and Returned to his former wickedness with ye addition of Counterfeiting and passing bills of Publick Credit."<ref target="#CH8-n41">

            <p>A third passer of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> counterfeits was <persName>David Adams</persName>, alias <persName>Timothy Green</persName>, of <persName>East Haddam</persName>, who at <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> on March 27 passed a false 2/6 bill to <persName>Samuel Morris, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>Killingly</placeName>. <placeName>Morris</placeName> at once complained to Justice <persName>Bowen</persName>, who had <persName>Adams</persName> arrested and, after examining him, bound him over to the Superior Court, setting bail at £200. As <persName>Adams</persName> could not provide a bond, he was committed to jail. He was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced in accordance with law. On the evening of April 10, the day he was sentenced, he broke jail in company with <persName>Samuel Dusten</persName> and was not retaken.<ref target="#CH9-n2">

            <p>The source of the false <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> money was doubtless Dr. <persName>Samuel Dusten</persName> (also called <persName>Dustin</persName>, <persName>Dunston</persName>, or <persName>Dunstin</persName>) "of Haverhill, Essex County, physician." In the summer of 1751 Dusten had been associated with <persName>Jonathan Woodman</persName> and <persName>Joseph Bill</persName> in counterfeiting and passing <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> bills and later that year had been arrested and tried in Portsmouth, <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>, for passing bogus paper money of that province. By some strange chance, for he was surely guilty, he had been acquitted. A <placeName>New York</placeName> newspaper in August, 1751, described him as a tall, slim man, wearing red plush breeches and a black wig.<ref target="#CH9-n4">

            <p>On March 27, 1755, at <placeName>Woodstock Dusten</placeName> made the following counterfeit bills: of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> ninety of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and fifteen of £5; of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> thirty-eight of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., three hundred and forty-five of 2/6 and three hundred and sixty-five of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Captain <persName>John Payson</persName> complained of <persName>Dusten</persName> to Justice <persName>Bowen</persName>, and the physician was arrested, examined and bound over to the Superior Court, with bail set at £200. At the April sessions he was indicted, tried, and convicted. On April 10 he was sentenced in accordance with law but the same night, together with <persName>Adams</persName>, broke jail and fled to parts unknown.<ref target="#CH9-n5">

               <p>About the middle of July, 1755, <persName>Jonathan</persName> Hunter of <placeName>Sharon</placeName> discovered that three of his fellow townsmen, <persName>Amos Tyler</persName>, <persName>Caleb Strong</persName> and <persName>Ebenezer Jackson, Jr.</persName>, were involved in counterfeiting and passing. Upon his complaint to <persName>John Williams, J.P.</persName>, they were arrested and examined by Justices <persName>Williams</persName> and <persName>James Landon</persName>. <persName>Hunter</persName> charged that <persName>Tyler</persName> had in his custody false bills, coin or counterfeiting implements, and when <persName>Tyler</persName> was taken up, <persName>David Hamilton</persName>, sheriff's deputy, found a counterfeit Spanish dollar in the <persName>chimney wall</persName> of <persName>Tyler's</persName> house. At their examination, however, there appeared to be nothing conclusive against them, when suddenly <persName>Jackson</persName>, who apparently had been engaged in counterfeiting for only a short time, offered to turn King's Evidence. He then admitted that he had received £50 in false <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills, of which he had passed about half, for example, one 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill and two £5 bills to <persName>Zachary Hoffman</persName> of <placeName>Dutchess County</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>. He also denounced his associates.</p>
               <p>At his first examination, before Justice <placeName>Landon</placeName>, he swore that he had received a bad dollar as good from <persName>Amos Tyler</persName> as part of the payment for a yoke of steers. Later, however, after he had been accepted as King's Evidence, he admitted that the dollar had been passed him by <persName>Tyler</persName> with the full knowledge of both men that the coin was counterfeit, Because of this contradiction the justices decided to use him no longer as King's Evidence, and he was bound over to the next Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> to answer to a charge of perjury. He was then released on bail of £100 provided by himself and his father.</p>
               <p>Before the next sessions of the Superior Court a grand juror, learning that <persName>Jackson</persName> had put off some counterfeit £5 bills, lodged a complaint against him and Jackson was arrested, bound over to the August sessions of the Superior Court and released on bail of £60. The King's Attorney decided not to prosecute <persName>Jackson</persName> for perjury but, when he was called three times on August 12 at the Superior Court
<pb n="129"/>
to answer to the charge of having passed counterfeit bills, he did not appear and both his bonds were declared forfeited.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Jackson</persName>, on May 15, 1756, petitioned the Assembly that his bond be forgiven or abated. He stated that he could not pay in full without bringing ruin on his father and pinching want on his wife and children. The petition was accompanied by a testimonial to his good conduct, signed by a number of persons before <persName>Samuel Hutchinson, J.P.</persName>, on May 14, a certificate by <persName>Cotton Mather Smith</persName> that <persName>Ebenezer</persName> had conducted himself "like a true and humble Penitent," a statement that on the <persName>Lord's Day Jackson</persName> had publicly made confession of his sin, and a declaration about his good conduct made by Justice <persName>John Williams</persName>. The Assembly was favorably impressed and voted that he was to be discharged from the bonds on payment of £30 and all costs.<ref target="#CH9-n7">

                  <persName>David Hamilton</persName>, sheriff's deputy, on July 22 made a thorough search of <persName>Amos Tyler's</persName> house, where he found nine counterfeit £5 <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills on a shelf and eight more wrapped up in paper and placed under a stone. <persName>Tyler</persName> had shown him these bills, for before the magistrate he had made a full confession. He admitted that, persuaded by a "wicked man," he had received and passed counterfeit <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> bills. He was bound over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> and was released on bail of £60 furnished by himself and <persName>Bezaleel Tyler, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>Sharon</placeName>, and this he forfeited by failing to appear in court. Like Jackson, he petitioned the Assembly, stating that he could not pay his bond without the ruin of his father and innocent brother and claiming that he had been trying night and day to discover the man who had led him into passing false money. The Assembly reduced his bond to £20 plus all costs.<ref target="#CH9-n8">

to answer to a charge of perjury, since he had denied that he <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> the dollar he passed to <persName>Jackson</persName> was false.

He was acquitted of this charge but his arrest prevented his appearance to answer to the charge of perjury, so that the £100 bond was declared forfeited. On May 16, 1756, he memorialized the Assembly, setting forth that he was a poor man with a wife and numerous children and that he owed various just debts. His request for relief from payment of the bond and costs was granted.<ref target="#CH9-n9">

               <p>In July, 1755, information reached <persName>Samuel Coit, J.P.</persName>, of <placeName>Preston</placeName> that <persName>Joseph</persName> Avery of <placeName>Norwich</placeName> had come from <persName>Dover</persName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, with one <persName>Cocker</persName>, who was suspected of having counterfeited <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills of the emission of January 8, 1755, and that these two men had a large quantity of such bogus money. Coit issued warrants for their arrest, and <persName>Cocker</persName> fled to <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, whither Coit sent Deputy Sheriff <persName>Roger Bills</persName> after him. Governor <persName>Hopkins</persName> of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> renewed the warrant but the fugitive was not sent back to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. Coit did have Avery apprehended but could not obtain sufficient evidence to bind him over to the Superior Court.<ref target="#CH9-n16">

               <p>The <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill had been counterfeited and these false notes were being passed in November, 1755. The <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Gazette</hi> of November 22, under the heading of <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, stated:
<q>Thursday last a Man was apprehended in this Town, on Suspicion of counterfeiting Money of this Colony: There was found upon him 14 Bills of <hi rend="italic">Ten Shillings</hi> lawful Money of the <hi rend="italic">January Emission</hi>, which appear to be counterfeit; but are so dextrously done, as hardly to be distinguished by a nice Observer: Strict Examination is now making to discover the Bottom of this Iniquity, and to give suitable Descriptions that People may not be imposed on; but as the Types seem to be the same with the true Bills, great Caution is necessary to be used.—A counterfeit 3 1. <persName>Bill</persName> of <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>NewYork</placeName> Money</hi>, of 1746, was also found in his Custody.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A description of the counterfeit bill and a notice of the arrest of two more passers thereof appeared in the same newspaper of November 29. The item reads:</p>
               <p>We hear one Man has been taken up at <hi rend="italic">

                     <placeName>New-London</placeName>
                  </hi>, and 'tis said has confessed the Types were stole from the PRINTER'S there, as they are certainly the same sort of Types with the Originals, and very exactly done, only the Flourishes round the Bill, not quite so neat as the Originals. In the Arms of the true Bills, in the Word SI GIL, the Letters are of an equal Size, but in the Counterfeits, the Letter S, is larger in Proportion, than the I, and the I is rather less in Proportion, than the rest of the Word. <hi rend="italic">Also</hi>, In the Body of the Bill, in the Words <hi rend="italic">By Order</hi>, the B is larger in the Counterfeit, than the true Bills, and both the r's in <hi rend="italic">Order</hi>, are less than in the true Bills, the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> stands a little below the Line, but is strait in the Counterfeits, also <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Green</persName>,</hi> in the true Bills, is blotted a little, but clear in the Counterfeits. 'Tis said there are <hi rend="italic">Twenty-Shilling</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Forty-Shilling</hi> Bills of the same Emission counterfeit, as they have the same Arms and Flourishes, but we have not seen any of them.</p>
               <p>The person taken up at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> was <persName>John</persName> Dunlop. On November 19, 1755, in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> he passed a false 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. proclamation bill of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> to <persName>Jonathan Bulkley</persName> of that town. The same day <persName>Benjamin Keeler</persName> of <persName>Ridgefield</persName> complained of him to Justice <persName>Samuel Adams</persName>, who issued a warrant for the arrest of the suspected counterfeiter. Constable <persName>Nathan Bulkley</persName> took him up and brought him before the magistrate. On his person were found four more counterfeit 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills. He was bound over to the Superior Court and was released on bail of £200 furnished by himself and <persName>John Simson</persName> of <placeName>New London</placeName>.<ref target="#CH9-n17">

               <p>At his examination Dunlop accused <persName>Daniel McLean</persName> of <placeName>New London</placeName> of aiding in counterfeiting and passing. Justice <persName>Samuel Adams</persName> of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> at once sent word of this to Justice <persName>Pygan Adams</persName> of <placeName>New London</placeName>, who on November 21 had <persName>McLean</persName> arrested by Constable <persName>John Hempsted</persName> and committed him to jail because he could not find bail, which had been set at £300. <persName>McLean</persName> was indicted at the Superior Court held at <placeName>Norwich</placeName> on March 23, 1756, for imprinting four 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills and for assisting Dunlop in signing them. He was tried, convicted and sentenced in accordance with law.<ref target="#CH9-n18">

On February 20 he petitioned the court that execution of the sentence might be postponed until after May that he might have an opportunity to memorialize the Assembly.

On the magistrate's warrant Spicer was arrested by Deputy Sheriff Prosper <persName>Wetmore</persName> and brought before Justice <persName>Backus</persName>, who bound him over to the Superior Court and committed him to jail since he could not furnish bail, which had been set at £150. At the Superior Court he was indicted for having passed the four bills to Captain <persName>Bill</persName> and also for having about December 15, 1755, passed sixteen false 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills to <persName>Joseph Brewster</persName> of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>.

               <p>Doubtless one of the most important counterfeiters of the Colonial Period was <persName>Owen Sullivan</persName>, who was taken up in the year 1756. The <hi rend="italic">

                  <persName>Johnson</persName>, the famous Money Maker, who was detected and taken in <placeName>Dutchess County</placeName>, on Hudson's River, about 120 <persName>Miles</persName> above <placeName>New-York</placeName>,
<pb n="137"/>
in that Government, by the extraordinary Address and Resolution of <persName>Cornet Eliphalet Beecher</persName>.–We have a short Account of said Syllavan, which perhaps would not be disagreeable to our Readers, but for want of Room, must defer it till our next.</p>
               <p>The account, which appeared in this newspaper on April 13, 1756, is not found elsewhere and it gives details of <persName>Sullivan's</persName> career which would not otherwise be known. It reads as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Syllavan</persName>, alias <persName>Johnson</persName>, a few Years ago lived in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, and carried on the <persName>Goldsmith's</persName> Business, he was remarkable for being always flush of Money, tho' he lived in an expensive Manner, above his visable Income. A Difference between him and his Wife first bro't him under Suspicion: She having drank somewhat too freely, call'd him the £40,000 Money-maker, which being overheard, and several other Circumstances being collected against him, he was taken up on Suspicion, but got Securities for a very large Sum, stood Trial, and was acquitted, but not without a general Suspicion of his Guilt, which made him think proper to remove to <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>; where he counterfeited large Sums of Money, and had several Accomplices; but being suspected, they were all taken up. He strenuously pressed them to deny the Fact, and declare that the counterfeit Money proved to be passed by them, was received of him as true Money, assuring them, that if they acted according to his Direction, he would bring them all off clear; They all complied except one, who thinking to turn King's Evidence, confessed his having passed Money knowing it to be counterfeit; but his Evidence not convicting any of the rest, it was only taken against himself, the rest were all acquitted, he and Syllavan only were found guilty, and condemn'd to be cropt and branded. <persName>Syllavan</persName> being a Man of good Address, found Means to prejudice the Populace in his Favour, and got his Sentence executed in a Manner that did no Injury to his Person: And tho' he was by Sentence to remain a Prisoner, yet he obtained the Liberty to be present when the Sentence was to be executed upon his Accomplice, saying he would see it effectually done, as a Punishment for his Folly and Perfidy. Accordingly, being but slightly guarded, he broke from his Keepers, seiz'd a Cutlass, got into the Ring and encouraged the Executioner to do his Duty with <persName>Rigour</persName>, which being done, he fought his Way thro' the Crowd, escaped, and eluded the Pursuit made after him. A few Days after, he came and surrendered, saying, he would do that voluntarily, which he
<pb n="138"/>
had shown them, they could not force him to do. A few Days after, he broke Goal, and tho' pursued, made his Escape Sword in Hand, much in the same Manner as before; and retired to <placeName>Dutchess-County</placeName>, in the Province of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, where he provided himself with a secret retreating Place, and a Set of Accomplices for vending the Money that had been, or should be made by him, and supplying Necessaries, Conveniencies and Correspondents for putting the Business upon a regular Footing, and living comfortably upon it. Being an excellent Artist at casing and engraving, he so nicely counterfeited the Paper Currency of almost all the neighbouring Governments, that hardly the best Judges, could discover his, from the true Money. He carried on the Business successfully, for a considerable Time, vending large Sums, and getting for them true Money, Bonds, or other valuable Effects, and a large Resort of Company to him, so that it may be suspected he has many Accomplices yet undiscover'd. As his Exploits in <placeName>Boston</placeName> and <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>, in some Measure, wore out of Mind, he ventured to travel incog, and once went over to <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>. A considerable Trade was carried on last Year with his Money, among the Soldiers; who not suspecting it, took it instead of, or in Exchange for true Money; but the Fraud being at last discovered, and trac'd till some of the Parties concern'd, were detected; some of them were cropt and branded, and more of the Gang bro't under Suspicion. <persName>Cornet Eliphalet Beecher</persName> having been active in this Discovery, and suspecting two Tavern Keepers (Hunt and Morehouse) to belong to the same Gang, he went to one of them, and taking Occasion to change some Money with him, was paid a counterfeit <persName>Bill</persName> in part of his Change: He charg'd the Tavern Keeper with it, who at first deny'd it was counterfeit, then deny'd he knew it was so; but refused to tell the Person he had it of, and would gladly have given other Money for it; but Mr. <persName>Beecher</persName> carried him before a Magistrate, and by his Confession, several more of his Accomplices, and many of their Proceedings were discovered; particularly the Place of Syllavan's Retreat, whom it is said, there was now a Reward offer'd for taking. Mr. <persName>Beecher</persName>, taking one of the Prisoners with him for a Guide, went in Search of Syllavan's retreating Place. His Guide led him to a Swamp, in a large unfrequented Wood, where in the Side of a small Cliff of the Hill, made by the Stream, he removed some Brush, and the Stump of a Tree, which very artfully conceal'd the Mouth of a Cave; into this Cave Mr. <persName>Beecher</persName> and his Company went, and found it led by a long narrow Passage, into a handsome large
<pb n="139"/>

The Cavity where he was concealed, was dug under the Hearth, and had a Fire-place, the Smoak of which issued by a Vent into the Chimney above: It's said he offered a large Sum to Mr. <persName>Beecher</persName>, to let him escape, and that by his own Account, he has made Money, to the Amount of several Hundred Thousand Pounds: He says he can counterfeit any of the Money he has seen, but if he might be spared, would contrive a Plate that it should be impossible to counterfeit.<ref target="#CH9-n26">

He brought both prisoners before Justice <persName>Haviland</persName> of <placeName>Dutchess County</placeName>, who, together with Justice <persName>Humphry</persName>, examined them.

On April 14, 1756, <persName>Joshua Whitney</persName> of <placeName>Norfolk</placeName> and <persName>Elnathan Ashmun</persName> of Canaan complained to Justice <persName>David Whiting</persName> against <persName>Patingall</persName>. A warrant was issued, and the informers arrested <persName>Patingall</persName>, on whom they found about forty counterfeit 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills. He was bound over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> in August but since he could not find bondsmen for the bail of £100 he was committed on April 15 to the jail in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName>, from which he broke out and escaped in company with the two Boyces, Pierce and Fuller. His accusers were granted a reward of £10 by the Assembly.<ref target="#CH9-n43">

                  <persName>Daniel Galusha</persName> of <persName>Dover</persName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, was probably a member of the "Money Club." On April 1, 1756, a warrant for his arrest was issued in <placeName>New London</placeName> County, and on April 3 he was examined by Justice <persName>Simeon</persName> Miner in <placeName>Norwich</placeName> on suspicion of having been involved in counterfeiting and uttering bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and of the neighboring colonies. He was committed to the <placeName>Norwich</placeName> jail and kept there for five months before he was released, probably for want of sufficient evidence to obtain a conviction.<ref target="#CH9-n44">

               <p>It is not unlikely that <persName>Ebenezer</persName> Lothrop, the son of <persName>William Lothrop</persName> of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, was associated with <persName>Galusha</persName>. Young Lothrop in February was taken before authority in his town to be examined on the charge of counterfeiting <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills. Before any decision had been made by the justice of the peace, <persName>Ebenezer</persName> broke away from the grasp of the officer and fled to distant parts, whence he wrote to his father. On May 10, 1757, <persName>William Lothrop</persName> petitioned the Assembly, requesting that his son be allowed to return home exempt from all prosecution, since all charges and costs had been paid in full by his father and friends and all the counterfeit bills passed by <persName>Ebenezer</persName> had similarly been made good. In case there should prove to be more of them, they too would be redeemed. The Assembly approved the request on condition that within ten days after <persName>Ebenezer</persName>'s return he provide sureties in the amount of £100 for his good behavior. He

               <p>On or about July 21 a transient person named <persName>Joseph</persName> Payne in <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> passed a false English guinea to Hannah Tanner, wife of Constable <persName>William Tanner</persName>. <persName>Tanner</persName> the next day went to <persName>Nathaniel Smith</persName>, a justice of the peace of <placeName>Dutchess County</placeName> and made a complaint against Payne, who was arrested and examined by <persName>Smith</persName> on July 22. Payne admitted passing the guinea, which he said he had received about a year before at <placeName>Noddles Island</placeName>, situated about three quarters of a mile southeast of <placeName>Boston</placeName>, from a High <persName>Dutchman</persName> named Conrad Shaver who lived in Schenectady. Payne realized full well that he had a counterfeit, for he admitted that Dr. <persName>Foot</persName> told him in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> that there was no more gold in the guinea than there was in his spur. After the examination Payne was brought to the colony line, where he was received in custody by <persName>Joel Harvey</persName>, Constable of <placeName>Sharon</placeName>, acting on a writ from Justice <persName>Williams</persName>. At the Superior Court held in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> in August Payne was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced to be whipped thirty stripes on his naked body and to pay costs of prosecution amounting to £13/1/2.<ref target="#CH9-n52">

                  <persName>John Carpenter</persName> of <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> was heavily in debt, which was perhaps the cause of his becoming a counterfeiter.

On his being committed to <placeName>Windham</placeName> Goal, he gave Hints that it was in his Power to bring out a great deal of Business of the same sort for the King's Attorney in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.—And 'tis probable, many of these false Pieces may have got abroad, the Publick notified of the following Marks by which to know them, viz. <hi rend="italic">They have a new Face, and of a remarkably blue Colour, and not white as common Dollars be.

He was bound over by Justice <persName>Amos Babcock</persName> in bail of £200 to the Superior Court held at <placeName>Windham</placeName> on September 16, 1760, at which "<persName>Samuel Ellis</persName>, alias <persName>Benjamin Swan</persName>" was indicted for having on April 24, 1760, uttered to <persName>James Ames</persName> of <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> seven counterfeit milled dollars. He pleaded guilty and begged the court to remember in his favor that after his arrest he frankly divulged the names and secrets of others combined in the same mischievous design, as a result

Soon after <persName>Swan</persName> fell ill and when he recovered he went into the army, got the smallpox and died at Crown Point on July 3, 1761. Parke memorialized the Assembly in October, 1761, praying that he be released from paying the £20 due on his note, and his request was granted.<ref target="#CH10-n2">

               <p>Some members of the gang which was broken up by the disclosures of <persName>Benjamin Swan</persName> were <persName>Parez Partridge</persName>, <persName>Stephen Brown</persName>, <persName>Edward Cogswell, Jr.</persName>, <persName>Samuel Palmer</persName>, <persName>Jacob Galusha</persName> and <persName>Park Beeman</persName>, all of <persName>Kent</persName>. Complaint against them was made on June 19 by Constable <persName>Eliphalet Comstock</persName> and <persName>Samuel Comstock</persName>, both of <persName>Kent</persName>, and <persName>Abel</persName> Camp of <placeName>New Milford</placeName> and warrants for the arrest of the suspected counterfeiters were issued by Justice <persName>Roger Sherman</persName>. <persName>Partridge</persName>, <persName>Cogswell</persName>, <persName>Beeman</persName>, <persName>Brown</persName> and <persName>Samuel Palmer</persName> were taken up by <persName>Eliphalet Comstock</persName>, who found and seized two false dollars on Partridge and three on <persName>Palmer</persName>. <persName>Daniel Barrit</persName>, a grand juror, complained on June 23 to Justice <persName>Sherman</persName> against still other suspected members of the gang, namely <persName>Zebulon Palmer</persName>, <persName>James Guthrie</persName>, <persName>Nathaniel Phillips</persName> and <persName>John Swan, Jr.</persName>, all of <persName>Kent</persName>. One of them, <persName>John Swan, Jr.</persName>, was arrested by <persName>John Slosson</persName>, a sheriff's deputy.</p>
               <p>The prisoners were examined by Justice <persName>John Ransom</persName> of <persName>Kent</persName>. <persName>Beeman</persName> was considered not guilty and was dismissed on payment of costs of nine shillings; <persName>Samuel Palmer</persName> confessed that he was guilty of passing. <persName>Palmer</persName> and the others in custody were bound over to the August term of the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> and were released on bail of £50 for each. Bonds were provided as follows: for <persName>Brown</persName> by <persName>Brown</persName> and <persName>Simeon Fuller</persName>; for Partridge by Partridge and <persName>Joseph Carter</persName>; for <persName>Cogswell</persName> by <persName>Cogswell</persName> and <persName>Emerson Cogswell</persName>;
<pb n="153"/>
for <persName>Swan</persName> by <persName>Swan</persName> and <persName>Isaac Swan</persName>; for <persName>Palmer</persName> by <persName>Palmer</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Skiff</persName>. <persName>Palmer</persName>, <persName>Partridge</persName> and <persName>Cogswell</persName> failed to appear in court and their bonds were declared forfeited, while Brown, who did appear, was accepted as King's Evidence and was discharged from his bond. The indictment of Swan, who was charged with having passed on May 20 at <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> a bad dollar to <persName>Mary Davis</persName>, wife of <persName>John Davis</persName> of that town, was returned ignoramus by the grand jury.</p>
               <p>Something is known of the activities of <persName>Brown</persName> and <persName>Cogswell</persName>. <persName>Cogswell</persName>, in January, 1760, went to work for <persName>Stephen Brown</persName>, <persName>blacksmith</persName>, in <placeName>Kent</placeName>. There he learned to make brass buttons and buckles but soon <persName>Brown</persName> induced him to run a few pieces of pewter in a stamped leaden mold of a milled ninepence to see whether pewter could be cast in a lead mold. No use was made of the pieces that were cast and the mold was soon run into a mass. Next <persName>Brown</persName> asked <persName>Cogswell</persName> to experiment with making dollars, but <persName>Cogswell</persName>, as he claimed, became suspicious and left him. It was said that the two men had worked late at night in the smithy on the pretence of making buttons, and one <persName>Mary Curtis</persName>, who was "tayloring" at <persName>Brown's</persName> in January or February, stated that the men locked the workroom "to keep out children" and once brought in a dollar from the shop and rang it on the hearth.</p>
               <p>At the Superior Court <persName>Cogswell</persName> heard a gentleman connected with the King's Attorney remark that "the name of <persName>Cogswell</persName> was above half enough to convict him," so that, thoroughly frightened, he fled and his bond was thus forfeited. In May, 1762, the Assembly granted that <persName>Cogswell</persName> and his bondsman be released from the bond if both or either paid down £25 and all costs before August 17. The three informers, Camp and the two Comstocks, were granted £5 each from the forfeited bonds.<ref target="#CH10-n3">

                  <persName>Whiting</persName>, on May 20, 1762, sent to the Assembly a memorial in which he stated that he had been a soldier in the present war.

The Assembly resolved
<pb n="155"/>
that the bond be reduced to £20 if that amount and costs were paid. A year later <persName>Whiting</persName> again petitioned, this time claiming that he had given the original bond through inadvertency and want of consideration and asking permission to give a bond for £20 and to have time to pay, a request which was denied by the Assembly.<ref target="#CH10-n6">

<q>Last Tuesday a young Woman was committed to Goal in this Town for counterfeiting and passing a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Bill of this Colony, the former was altered with a Pen from a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Bill, and the latter from a 1s. Bill.</q>

               <p>Yesterday a Man lately from <placeName>Long Island</placeName>, was taken into Custody on Suspicion of counterfeiting a Quantity of small Pieces of Silver.</p>
               <p>The young woman may be identified as <persName>Grace Edgcomb</persName>, a poor person of <placeName>New London</placeName>, who on February 12, 1763, was brought before <persName>Daniel Coit, J.P.</persName>, of <placeName>New London</placeName>. She was charged with uttering a counterfeit 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> of the emission of March 26, 1761. The magistrate bound her over to appear at the Superior Court to be held at <placeName>Norwich</placeName> in March, 1763, and she was released on bail of £50 furnished by <persName>Robert Douglass</persName> and <persName>Daniel Reynolds</persName>. At the time for her trial she came down with smallpox, and
<pb n="156"/>
the selectmen of <placeName>New London</placeName> removed her to a place provided for that purpose. As she could not appear in court, her bond was declared forfeited and judgment was given against her sureties, who in 1764 appealed in vain to the Assembly for relief.<ref target="#CH10-n8">

               <p>It is probable that the young man taken up in <placeName>New London</placeName> in February for counterfeiting small pieces of silver was <persName>David Howell</persName> of <placeName>Lyme</placeName>, who on March 22, 1763, was informed against by <persName>Matthew Griswold</persName>, King's Attorney.

               <p>In March, 1763, several persons were arrested in <placeName>Hebron</placeName> on suspicion of counterfeiting and passing. <persName>Aaron Baxter</persName> of <placeName>Hebron</placeName> was taken up and bound over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in September and he was released on bail furnished by himself and <persName>Simon Baxter</persName>, probably his brother, of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. He was indicted for having, at <placeName>Hebron</placeName> about April 20, 1762, counterfeited twenty silver milled quarters of dollars and having on April 30 passed six of them.<ref target="#CH10-n10">

               <p>Likewise under suspicion was <persName>Nathan Baxter</persName> of <placeName>Hebron</placeName>, who was arrested in March, 1763, bound over to the Superior Court held that

month in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> and indicted for having, on April 30, 1762, in <placeName>Hebron</placeName>, made ten false quarters of dollars out of pewter, copper and other mixed and base metals and having on the same day passed six of them. He was tried, acquitted and ordered dismissed on payment of costs of £22/2/1. Since he had no money, he was in April, 1764, bound out in service to his brother, <persName>Simon Baxter</persName>, for the term of two years to pay for the costs. A year later he petitioned the Assembly, pointing out that he had served his brother in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> for a year, that he had a wife and two small children in <placeName>Hebron</placeName> and that he was very infirm and subject to fits. He requested that some part of the costs be forgiven him but his prayer was denied by the Assembly.<ref target="#CH10-n12">

               </p>
               <p>It appears that <persName>Nathan Baxter</persName>, probably at his examination, cast suspicion upon Captain <persName>Samuel Gilbert</persName>, who was arrested on March 15, 1763, and brought before <persName>Alexander Phelps, J.P</persName>. and again before the same magistrate on March 21. He was bound over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in September and was released on bail of £6,000 furnished by himself, <persName>Thomas Perrin</persName>, <persName>Ebenezer Deucey</persName>, <persName>Seth Hall</persName> and <persName>Ebenezer Horton</persName>. He was charged with having about March 30, 1762, uttered to <persName>Aaron Baxter</persName> a false 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill of the emission of 1755 but his indictment was returned ignoramus by the grand jury and it was ordered that he be released on payment of costs of £26/6/4. <persName>Gilbert</persName> was indignant and in October he petitioned the Assembly that he be freed from paying costs. His contention was that there was no evidence against him save what was said by <persName>Baxter</persName>, whom he called a person "of the vilest character," that it was contrary to the practice of the mother country to impose costs on those acquitted, and that, if there were no indictment and trial, there should be no cost levied against him. The upper house denied his request and the lower house granted it, so that a committee was appointed to confer, and this group reached no decision in his favor.<ref target="#CH10-n13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>It developed that <persName>Baxter's</persName> testimony was false and had been supported by the evidence of <persName>Hosea Curtis</persName> of <placeName>Hebron</placeName>, who was twice
<pb n="158"/>
brought before the authorities for questioning. Rather than face the prospect of being committed to jail, Curtis decided to lie about <persName>Squire Gilbert</persName>, so he informed Justices <persName>Phelps</persName>, <persName>Talcott</persName> and others that <persName>Gilbert</persName> had taken him into a room and showed him a large quantity of counterfeit bills, which <persName>Gilbert</persName> said he had obtained from <persName>Joseph</persName> Bill, the famous money maker. Then, he said, <persName>Gilbert</persName> induced him to join in the business and fetch money from him. Later <persName>Curtis'</persName> conscience induced him to make a confession of his lying before the public congregation in the First Society in <placeName>Hebron</placeName> and he signed a confession which he desired to be read in all the parishes in that town and before the Superior Court in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. Justice <persName>Alexander Phelps</persName> testified that he had bound over <persName>Gilbert</persName> only because of the evidence of <persName>Curtis</persName> and <persName>Baxter</persName>, notwithstanding their "very bad" character as far as the truth was concerned. Captain <persName>Gilbert</persName>, armed with such evidence, memorialized the Assembly, which in October, 1769, fully released him from the costs which had been taxed against him.<ref target="#CH10-n14">

               <p>On January 27, 1763, <persName>Samuel Pettibone</persName>, King's Attorney of <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> County, complained to Justice <persName>John Patterson</persName> against <persName>Jonathan Olds</persName> of <persName>Egrimont Parish</persName> in Sheffield, <placeName>Berkshire County</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. He charged that at <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> on January 25 Olds made thirty Spanish dollars and the following day passed one of

them to <persName>Hopestill Pierce</persName>, wife of <persName>Lieutenant Joshua Pierce</persName> of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, another to the wife of <persName>Jeremiah Griswold</persName> of <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> and a third to some person in <placeName>Sharon</placeName>. <persName>John Pierce</persName>, Constable of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, arrested Olds on January 27 and the prisoner was examined and bound over in bail of £100 to the August term of the Superior Court in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName>. Olds pleaded guilty and was sentenced to be whipped thirty lashes and to pay costs of £20/8-. Sheriff <persName>Oliver Wolcott</persName> had him whipped at the sign post in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> and then sent back to jail, doubtless because the costs were not paid.<ref target="#CH10-n16">

                  <persName>Ebenezer</persName> Marsh on July 26, 1763, complained to Justice <persName>Timothy Collins</persName> of <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> that a stranger, supposed to be between twenty and thirty years of age, of a light complexion and reddish beard, with a light colored coat and <persName>black neckcloth</persName>, had that day passed to him, <persName>Marsh</persName>, a <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> is. bill of the emission of March 26, 1761, which had been altered to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. A warrant was issued, and the stranger, <persName>Elisha Arnold</persName> of <placeName>Norwalk</placeName>, was bound over in bail of £500 to the August term of the Superior Court in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> and committed to jail for want of bondsmen. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in accordance with law. At the sign post in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> on August 20 his right ear was cut off and he was branded on the forehead with C. From the jail in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> in January, 1764, he sent a petition to the Assembly, stating that he was young and had been persuaded to commit his crime by an older person. He requested that he be released from prison and allowed to pay the costs of his case by being assigned to service, a prayer which the Assembly rejected.<ref target="#CH10-n17">

               <p>Late in 1763 <persName>John Silliman</persName> of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> was informed against by <persName>David Lyon</persName> of that town to <persName>Andrew Burr</persName>, <persName>J.P. Silliman</persName> was charged with altering two 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills of the emission of March 26,

1761, one raised to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the other to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and with passing them both, probably to <persName>William Hawley</persName> of Redding and Asa Blodget of Salisbury. Justice <persName>Burr bound</persName> the prisoner over to the Superior Court to be held at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> in February, 1764, and <persName>Silliman</persName> was released on bail of £100, which was provided by <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Daniel Silliman</persName> and <persName>Nathaniel Wilson</persName>, <persName>Jr. John's</persName> story, which is perhaps to be taken with more than a grain of salt, was that he did not know that one of the bills had been altered, and that the other had been paid him in August by a stranger for some store goods. He discovered that the stranger was Elisha Arnold, who was convicted and jailed in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> for his counterfeiting. <persName>John Silliman</persName> and <persName>Andrew Patchen</persName>, who had seen the stranger, went to <placeName>Litchfield</placeName>, where <persName>Patchen</persName> recognized <persName>Arnold</persName>. <persName>Arnold</persName> admitted to <persName>Patchen</persName> in the presence of a fellow prisoner, <persName>Phebe Elderkin</persName>, that he had altered and passed the bill. <persName>Silliman</persName>, however, explained that he could not secure Phebe's testimony, since she was in prison. When the grand jury returned his indictment billa vera, he was greatly frightened and decamped, so that his bond was declared forfeited. The Assembly turned a deaf ear to a plea for relief from payment of the bond which was made by <persName>Silliman</persName> and his two sureties in October, 1764.<ref target="#CH10-n18">

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Gazette</hi> of January 7, 1764, published in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, had the following to report on counterfeiting:</p>
               <p>Several Counterfeit Bills of this Colony have of late been observed to pass; – – – They are chiefly Thirty Shilling Bills, altered from One Shilling Bills of March 1762 – Emission but they are done after such a bungling Manner, that the Cheat is very easily discovered.</p>
               <p>One Day last Week, a Person in <persName>Killingsworth</persName>, was taken up on Suspicion of altering some of the Bills, of this Colony; 'tis said he is admitted to Bail, till the Time for his Tryal comes on.</p>
               <p>The person arrested in <placeName>Killingworth</placeName> was <persName>Abel Buel</persName>. His father was dead and <persName>Abel</persName>, who was still a minor, was under the guardianship of <persName>John Spencer</persName> of <placeName>Killingworth</placeName>. <persName>Abel</persName> had learned the trade of <persName>silversmith</persName> as apprentice to <persName>Ebenezer Chittenden</persName>, had married and was
<pb n="161"/>
desirous of setting up in business for himself. To this end he had his guardian purchase for him a house and nine rods of land "conveniently situated for a <persName>silversmith</persName>" on the post road. Spencer also advanced money toward finishing the house and erecting a shop and for the support of Abel's family and workmen. It was agreed that when <persName>Abel</persName> was of age he would execute a deed for enough of his estate to repay Spencer. The need for money in December, 1763, induced the young man to try his hand at counterfeiting by altering four <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> 2/6 bills to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each and passing them, one to <persName>Zephaniah Clark</persName>. Constable <persName>Niel Buel</persName> discovered the crime and on December 29, 1763, complained against <persName>Abel</persName> to Justice <persName>Benjamin Gale</persName>. <persName>Abel</persName> was taken up, examined on December 31 and bound over in bail of £400 to the Superior Court to be held at <placeName>New London</placeName> in March, 1764. The bond was furnished by Abel, his guardian and his former master, <persName>Ebenezer Chittenden</persName>. At the Superior Court he was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced in accordance with law.<ref target="#CH10-n19">

               <p>In May, 1764, <persName>Abel</persName>, then in the jail in <placeName>New London</placeName> in close prison, petitioned the Assembly. He set forth that he had no means of support, was out of health and in danger of perishing, whereupon the Assembly resolved that he be released if he procured bail of £100 conditioned on his being of good behavior and not departing out of the limits of the town of <placeName>Killingworth</placeName> without the special licence of the Assembly.<ref target="#CH10-n20">
                     <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
                  </ref> At the same time the legislators appointed <persName>Matthew Griswold</persName> to sell Buel's estate.

                  <persName>Abel</persName>, who had been in jail since April 6, was released on July 21, 1764. Encouraged by the success of his plea to the Assembly, in October, 1765, he' sent another memorial to that body. He pointed out that he was under many disadvantages because he was confined to the limits of <placeName>Killingworth</placeName> and that he might be a more useful member of society if this restriction were removed and he were permitted to trade and deal in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. His prayer this time was denied by both houses.<ref target="#CH10-n23">
                     <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                  </ref> Undaunted by this rebuff, <persName>Abel</persName> again petitioned the Assembly in October, 1766. His memorial set forth
<q>that from a compassionate regard and pity on his youthful follies, this Assembly did enlarge him from his prison and suffer him to follow the lawful business of his calling, in the prosecuting of which he has discovered a method of grinding and polishing chrystals and other stones of great value, all of the growth of this Colony, without the aid and assistance of any person skilled in that art, by which discovery a great saving and advantage will accrue to this Colony; praying that in consequence of such discovery he might be released from the punishments by law enjoyned, and that he might be restored to those liberties and priviledges which he had justly forfeited.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Assembly was impressed and granted his request on condition that he give bond with sufficient sureties in the amount of £200 that he be of peaceable and good behavior and so not offend in like manner against the laws of the colony.<ref target="#CH10-n24">

                  <persName>Peletiah Turner</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName> on August 29, 1765, was complained of to Justice <persName>John Ledyard</persName> for having counterfeited some eighteenpenny pieces (quarters of dollars) and uttered one of them. He was apprehended, examined and bound over to appear at the Superior Court to be held at <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in September, 1765. Because of the sickness of his mother and his child the case was continued to March, 1766, and Turner was released on bail of £60 furnished by himself and his father, <persName>Caleb</persName>.</p>
               <p>As <persName>Peletiah</persName> was a seafaring man and his necessities were pressing, he applied to Captain <persName>Thomas Seymour</persName>, the King's Attorney, to learn whether the courts would do any business at all on account of the Stamp Act. Since the opinion was that no business would be done, <persName>Peletiah</persName> went off to sea. Criminal cases, however, were heard, and he was solemnly called three times at the court but was away on a voyage, so that his bond was declared forfeited. In October, 1768, his father petitioned the Assembly for relief, pointing out that the payment of the bond would take the whole of his estate, and got the bond chancered down to £20, for which <persName>Caleb</persName> gave a bond to be paid with interest in two years. On October 12, 1770, however, he asked for further relief, claiming that his son could not pay and that he, Caleb, was advanced in years and ill able to furnish the money which was now due. This time, however, he seems to have obtained no further favors from the legislators.<ref target="#CH11-n1">

August 30, 1765, was complained of to Justice <persName>Ledyard</persName> for having, on the previous day, passed to <persName>Caleb Bull</persName> in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> a counterfeit Spanish coin known as an eighteenpenny piece. Young Turner was arrested by <persName>John Skinner, Jr.</persName>, a sheriff's deputy, examined, bound over to appear at the September term of the Superior Court in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> and released on bail of £100 furnished by <persName>Caleb Turner, Jr.</persName>, and <persName>Caleb Turner, Sr</persName>.

               <p>Another case which Seymour refused to prosecute was that of <persName>Ichabod Hill</persName>, described as a transient person residing at <persName>Colebrook</persName> in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> County. <persName>John Chester</persName>, assistant, issued a warrant on the information from Seymour that <persName>Hill</persName> on July 30 at <placeName>Hartford</placeName> had coined twenty Spanish milled dollars, and <persName>Jonathan Humphry</persName>, a sheriff's deputy, arrested <persName>Hill</persName> on August 31, when he was bound over in bail of £100 to appear at the September term of the Superior Court.

On October 3, 1766, his father sent a petition to the Assembly, pointing out that he had but a small estate, was advanced in years and was in poor health. To pay the £100 would take all that he had and leave him and his small family in a deplorable condition. His request for relief, however, was flatly rejected.<ref target="#CH11-n4">

               <p>On November 14, 1766, two complaints against <persName>Simeon</persName> Scripture of Coventry were made to Justice <persName>Samuel Gray</persName>. <persName>Jonathan Huntington</persName>, a grand juror, charged that on November 10 Scripture passed a false dollar to <persName>Mercy Fitch</persName>, innholder (who before September, 1767, married <persName>Eleazer Carey</persName> of <placeName>Windham</placeName>), while <persName>Joseph Estabrooks</persName> complained that Scripture had uttered a bad dollar to Amariah Storrs of <placeName>Mansfield</placeName>. A warrant was issued and the accused was arrested and examined by Justice <persName>Gray</persName>, who bound him over to the next term of the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Windham</placeName>, setting bail for the first charge at £100 and for the second at £200. As no bondsmen were found, Scripture was committed to jail. In his possession was found a slip of paper on which were listed the following items presumably used by him for counterfeiting coin: "3 ll of cristel asneck, 3 ll sol Nitire or sault peter, 3 11 of Red tarture or wine stone, 3 ll of Salamoneck, 1 ll of sand over, 2 oz markury sublemate, 2 oz Boriks, 3 Nests Crusabls." Scripture was indicted in September, 1767, but his case was apparently continued, for in September, 1769, he was tried, convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of £60 and costs of £31/2/–.<ref target="#CH11-n8">

               <p>Last Week a Person was committed to the Goal in this Town, on Suspicion of counterfeiting Mill'd Dollars; and two other Persons taken up on the like Suspicion procured Bonds, for their Appearance at Court; and another Person has been committed to <placeName>Springfield Goal</placeName>, on the same Account, So that if these Money Makers could procure a Currency that necessary Article, which is now so much wanted among us, would be very plenty; – – – But many of their Dollars are made in so bungling a Manner, that any Person who has ever seen a Dollar, may very easily discover the Cheat.</p>
               <p>Two individuals arrested, probably in August, for having coined dollars were <persName>Jeremiah Phelps</persName> and<persName> Phineas Granger</persName>. It was charged that <persName>Phelps</persName>, a transient person, about July at <placeName>Windsor</placeName> made 100 dollars and afterwards at Suffield, <placeName>Windsor</placeName> and elsewhere uttered to <persName>Abel Forster</persName> and others more than ten of these pieces.

The grand jury at the September, 1767, term of the Superior Court at <placeName>Hartford</placeName> returned Granger's indictment ignoramus and very likely did the same with <persName>Phelps's.</persName> It appears that Granger could not pay his costs, for he was confined in jail with Burbank.<ref target="#CH11-n10">

               <p>In August, 1767, <persName>Isaac Bidwell</persName> of <placeName>Farmington</placeName> discovered that <persName>Timothy Burbank</persName>, who first lived in Suffield and later in <placeName>Springfield</placeName>, had lately passed a counterfeit dollar to <persName>Daniel Hosford</persName> in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. <persName>Bidwell</persName>, also hearing that Burbank had a number of counterfeit Spanish dollars, went to <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, found him there and notified the King's Attorney. Burbank was apprehended and on him were found

many base dollars and materials, such as copper and arsenic, for making more. In September he was indicted at the Superior Court at <placeName>Hartford</placeName> for having on July 31 at that town uttered to Experience (her name is elsewhere given as <persName>Hannah</persName>) <persName>Hinsdale</persName>, wife of <persName>Amos Hinsdale</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, to <persName>Sarah Stilman</persName>, <persName>Elijah Wright</persName> and <persName>Abigail Griswold</persName>, all three of <placeName>Wethersfield</placeName>, and to one other person, each a bad Spanish dollar. He pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of £40 and costs of about £20.<ref target="#CH11-n11">

               <p>Burbank did not pay his fine and costs, so he was remanded to jail, from which, on the night of September 29, with aid from persons outside, he escaped along with two burglars, a debtor and <persName>Phineas Granger</persName>.

               <p>A memorial submitted to the Assembly in January, 1769, by <persName>Isaac Colton</persName> of <placeName>Springfield</placeName> is important for the information it gives of widespread coining carried on by gangs in 1767 and 1768 and of one attempt to break them up. His petition shows.</p>
               <p>That in the year 1767 and forepart of the year 1768, it was very generally suspected that there were numbers of Persons in the Provinces of <placeName>New York</placeName>
                  <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and in this Colony who
<pb n="171"/>
were Combined together and actually carried on in Parties and <persName>Gangs</persName>, here and there, the wicked and detestable Practice of Counterfeiting and uttering many Different sorts of foreign Coins the most passable within the said several Provinces to the great wrong of the Community in general as well as the open Violation of the Laws of the Land—and as these Evils seemed more &amp; more to increase and of Course the more threatening, they soon became the object of publick Notice and attention—To Remedy and prevent which your Memorialist was pitched upon and furnished with proper Credentials Warrants &amp; authority from the Governors of the several Provinces and Colonies afores:<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and other the Civil authority within the same to goe in Quest of Discover &amp; apprehend such Evil offenders in order to their being brot to Justice, and also Search out pursue break up and drive from their Lurking Places such wicked Combinations and Parties as aforesaid, that no further impositions might be made by such false and base Coins as aforesd.</p>
               <p>About January, 1768, Colton set about the task and devoted himself to it for a year. At great peril and risk of his life he took and brought several different offenders to punishment and drove off and dispersed others to distant points. He had taken no person in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> but had saved that colony a considerable sum in the prosecution of a person convicted of uttering false coins there. He asked for a reward but the committee appointed by the Assembly to investigate his claim reported that he had received about £60 from three of the other governments; they therefore somewhat smugly recommended no grant, since any further reward, in their opinion, should be paid by those who had first employed him.<ref target="#CH11-n15">

               </p>
               <p>One such gang in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> consisted of six members, <persName>William Severs</persName> of Colerain, <persName>Michael</persName> and <persName>Samuel Falshaw</persName>, <persName>Barkiah Cady</persName>, <persName>Ebenezer Covel</persName> and <persName>Jonathan Herrington</persName>, all of <placeName>Killingly</placeName>, and they were prosecuted by <persName>Elisha Paine</persName>, King's Attorney of <placeName>Windham</placeName> County. At the Superior Court held at <placeName>Windham</placeName> in March, 1768, they were indicted, each for having about December 30, 1767, made thirty-one pistareens and passed two of them. The accused in March

signed a confession of guilt.<ref target="#CH11-n16">

               <p>Early in February, 1768, a band of counterfeiters was detected in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> County. <persName>Abel</persName> Prindle of <placeName>Newtown</placeName> on February 9 complained to Justice <persName>Richard Fairman</persName> against <persName>William Imus</persName> of <placeName>New Milford</placeName> and <persName>Nathaniel Bunnell</persName> of <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>, charging that in October, 1767, they had in their possession a stamp or types for making 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bills and that about October they struck off such notes at <placeName>Stratford</placeName>. Prindle also complained on February 12 to Justice <persName>Ebenezer Silliman</persName> that Daniel Sturges, 3rd, of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> had procured to be made a copper plate for striking 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.</p>
               <p>At his examination Imus made a full confession. He was accepted as King's Witness and therefore was not prosecuted, so that Prindle lost the £10 reward for which he had hoped and for which he petitioned the Assembly in vain.<ref target="#CH11-n18">

December 10, 1767, made a copper plate for forging 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and another plate for the 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills of <placeName>New York</placeName> and also for having counselled Imus to forge many such paper notes.

               <p>Sturges was also bound over to the February term of the Superior Court and was released on bail of £500 furnished by himself and his father. He was indicted for having forged a copper plate for making 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills and for having uttered some such bills and also counterfeit 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bills, as well as for having made twenty Spanish milled dollars of pewter and other mixed metals. "Fearing and dreading the consequences," Sturges did not appear when he was called, and his bond was declared forfeited.<ref target="#CH11-n20">
                     <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
                  </ref> On April 17 Daniel Sturges and his father petitioned the Assembly, showing that payment of the forfeited bond would reduce them to beggary. <persName>Daniel's</persName> story was that he had been induced by evil-minded persons to contribute towards the purchase of plates to make <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills; before they were done, however, he had repented of his wickedness and had had nothing more to do with the scheme. As for two counterfeit 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bills which he had had, he stated that he had sold two hundred weight of flax at 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> a pound to <persName>Archibald Phippenny</persName>, who had given him the bills as part payment. Sturges was suspicious of them but Phippenny told him to show them to neighbors and that he would take them back if they proved to be bad. So <persName>Daniel</persName> showed them to <persName>Peter</persName> Sturges and, on his advice, took them to Increase <persName>Bradley</persName>, who traded to <placeName>New York</placeName>. <persName>Bradley</persName> pronounced them counterfeits and <persName>Daniel</persName> set out to return them to <placeName>Phippenny</placeName> but was hindered by a rainstorm and then fell ill. When he heard of <placeName>Phippenny's</placeName> arrest, he burnt the false money. The Assembly was apparently moved by this story, for it voted that the bond be chancered down to £100,

exclusive of all costs taxed against Sturges.<ref target="#CH11-n21">
                     <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                  </ref> It developed, however, that <persName>Daniel</persName> and his father could not pay the £100 and costs, so they received permission in May, 1770, to give a bond for the money, with the understanding that the bond was to be paid with interest on June 1, 1771.<ref target="#CH11-n22">

He was indicted for having about December 10, 1767, in <placeName>Stratford</placeName> made a plate for striking 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills and for having, assisted by Imus, made such a bill; also for having fashioned a plate for counterfeiting 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bills and, together with Imus, made thirty-six such notes and passed a large number of them.

                  <persName>David Mallet</persName>, <persName>John's</persName> father, on May 4, 1768, petitioned the Assembly for the release of his son, who had received corporal punishment and was sentenced to prison for life. He presented evidence that about three years before <persName>John</persName> had been hit on the head with a crowbar in a sawmill and as a result had been out of his mind for a month and his understanding was impaired. <persName>John</persName> was, moreover, one who was easily imposed on, so that he had foolishly given a bond of £600 for a kinsman named <persName>Peter Mallet</persName> and was faced with the loss of all his estate to pay it. While he was melancholy over this and in great distress of mind, he had been approached by <persName>William Imus</persName>, "late of Great Britain but now of <placeName>New Milford</placeName>," and other counterfeiters, who told him it was not illegal to make 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bills. <persName>John</persName> had then given Imus a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bill from which to make a plate and also £8 in <placeName>New York</placeName> money. <persName>Imus</persName> had struck off and signed some <placeName>New York</placeName> bills, of which <persName>John</persName> got thirty-six but passed none. Jailer <persName>John Camp</persName> in May sent a statement to the Assembly that <persName>John</persName>, since confinement in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>, had been a faithful prisoner and a true penitent.

gotten into financial difficulties was Seth Porter of <placeName>Stratford</placeName>, the son of <persName>John Porter</persName>. <persName>Seth</persName> was, like <persName>John Mallet</persName>, tempted to extricate himself from his financial troubles by forging money. He was arrested, examined by Justice <persName>Fairman</persName>, pleaded guilty and was bound over in £1,000 to appear at the next Superior Court in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>. Sheriff <persName>Hezekiah Fitch</persName> released him on a bond of £1,000 provided by <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Thomas</persName> Porter of <placeName>Stratford</placeName>. Seth was indicted for making thirty-six <placeName>New York</placeName> 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills and passing some of them but he did not appear when called, so that the bond was declared forfeited and an attachment was levied on the estates of his bondsmen by the sheriff, who had been amerced £300 for his failure to produce Seth in court. On April 28, 1768, <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Thomas Porter</persName> petitioned the Assembly for relief, as did the sheriff on May 10. It was shown that <placeName>Phippenny</placeName> was the first mover in the scheme to counterfeit money and that Seth had merely lent Imus money for the undertaking. Seth had passed a false 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New York</placeName> bill to <persName>John Middlebrook</persName> and another to <persName>John Turny</persName> but had bought back both bills. The Assembly resolved that Fitch be released from the amercement if he pay £225 and that the bond given by the Porters be reduced to £225 plus costs. In May, 1769, <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Thomas</persName> Porter were permitted to recover their lands, which had been seized, by giving a bond to the King's Attorney and were to have until January 1, 1770, to pay it. Perhaps the Assembly was influenced by the fact that <persName>John Porter</persName> was ensign of the trainband, had a wife and six children, three sons and three daughters, and had suffered manifold misfortunes.<ref target="#CH11-n28">

               <p>Another partner in the scheme, <persName>Lewis Bennett</persName> of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>, was complained of on February 11 by <persName>John</persName> Silliman of that town to <persName>Ebenezer Silliman, J.P.</persName>, who issued a writ for the arrest of Bennett. Constable <persName>Ebenezer Silliman, Jr.</persName>, apprehended him, and the magistrate bound him over in £500 to the next term of the Superior Court and committed him to jail for want of bondsmen.

He asked for release but his prayer was denied. In October 11, 1771, he again besought the legislators for release, sending with his petition a testimonial concerning his good conduct and character signed by some nineteen citizens of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>.

He was bound over in £1,000 to the next term of the Superior Court and charged with having had made a plate for striking 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills and with having caused Phippenny to make a bill from the plate.

On May 15, 1769, he petitioned the Assembly for relief, setting forth that he had become very poor because of illness in the family, that he had five children very dear to him, that he had an incurable lameness in one hip since youth, that his wife had been unfaithful to his bed, the results of which had put him to great charge and expense, and that she had lately left the colony and took no care of her family.

               <p>Amos Crittenden of <placeName>Farmington</placeName>, together with a transient person named Oliver Kellog, on January 9, 1770, came to <persName>Ebenezer</persName> Hamlin of <placeName>Farmington</placeName> with a view to purchasing a horse.

Sturdevant was bound over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> and was then released on bail of £100, furnished by <persName>Caleb Knap</persName>, <persName>Nathan Sturdevant</persName> and <persName>Jonathan Pinney</persName>, all of <persName>Norfolk</persName>.

               </head>
               <p>In March and April, 1770, a considerable number of persons in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> County were charged with counterfeiting. They were <persName>Thomas</persName> Howard Wagstaff, <persName>John True</persName>, <persName>John Williamson</persName>, Michael Dunning, Everet and Joshua Baker, <persName>Benjamin Wyncoop</persName>, <persName>William Stone</persName>, <persName>James</persName> and <persName>David Hait</persName>, Captain <persName>David Thayer</persName>, <persName>Nathaniel Smith</persName>, alias <persName>Biggelow</persName>, and one How, alias <persName>Biggelow</persName>. The chief malefactor was apparently <persName>John True</persName>, who boasted to <persName>Wagstaff</persName> and others that he could stamp Spanish milled dollars of base metal. <persName>Wagstaff</persName> and various persons furnished the coiner with money and materials for the illicit scheme, and True and <persName>Wagstaff</persName> struck some dollars, of which <persName>Wagstaff</persName> later claimed that he had passed none. The activity of the band attracted notice, and <persName>Abel Booth</persName>, <persName>Jabez Botsford</persName> and <persName>Ebenezer Ford</persName> of <placeName>Newtown</placeName>, in company with <persName>Joseph Peirce</persName>, <persName>James Masters</persName>, <persName>Samuel Squire</persName>, <persName>Justus Peirce</persName>, <persName>Abraham Peirce</persName>, <persName>Israel Stoddard</persName> and <persName>Charles Hosmer</persName>, all of <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>, pursued and captured <persName>Wagstaff</persName> and others, for which service the Assembly in May, 1771, voted them small rewards.<ref target="#CH12-n5">

                  <persName>Thomas Howard Wagstaff</persName>, who had lived in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> and had come to reside in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> County, was arrested in March on a warrant
<pb n="183"/>
issued by <persName>Daniel Sherman</persName>, a justice of the peace in <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>. After an examination before Justice <persName>Sherman</persName> he was taken by Constable <persName>Israel Stoddard</persName> of <placeName>Woodbury</placeName> to Justice <persName>Caleb Baldwin</persName>, who bound him over in £100 to the Superior Court to be held at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> in August. <persName>Wagstaff</persName> confessed his guilt, and, as a result of his confession, various other persons and tools and implements were seized. The counterfeiters were confined in the jail of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> County. On the night of May 15 <persName>Wagstaff</persName>, together with the others imprisoned for the crime of counterfeiting, broke out and escaped. Advertisements were promptly published offering rewards for the capture of the fugitives. Furthermore application was made to <persName>Joseph Crane</persName> in <placeName>New York</placeName> Province to apprehend Wagstaff, who was said to frequent at times the place where Crane dwelt. This appeal brought results, for on October 8 Crane captured the man and brought him back to the jail at <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>.</p>
               <p>That month <persName>Wagstaff</persName> appealed to the Assembly, asserting that he was poor and friendless; friends of his wife, he said, were willing to give bond in the amount of £40 <placeName>New York</placeName> money for his appearance at the court to be held in <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> in February, in order that he might not have to endure the hardships of a winter in prison. Crane, his captor, was willing to ask for no reward or expenses in taking <persName>Wagstaff</persName> if the bail were accepted. The amount of the bond apparently was too small to be accepted, so he remained in jail until February, 1771, when he was indicted for having about February 7, 1770, made twenty quarters of dollars and passed some of them. He was tried, convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of £40 and costs of £27/6/8. He could not pay, so in May, 1771, he memorialized the Assembly for relief, setting forth that he had been imprisoned for fourteen months, that he had no means, that he was in bad health and that he had had many convulsive fits, to the truth of which <persName>Dr. John Allen</persName> made a sworn statement. His plea was denied but when it was repeated in August, 1771, the Assembly finally ordered his release on condition that he abide within the limits of the town of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>.<ref target="#CH12-n6">

               <p>Complaints were made against many suspected coiners.

When he was bound over to the August term of the Superior Court, his creditors, alarmed, stripped his wife of all his substance, and when, two weeks later, he secured bail and was released, he found his wife and fourteen children in a sad plight. Some children were weak, others were ill and they were all living on the highway without shelter. At his trial he was acquitted but could not pay the costs of £7/1/8, from payment of which the Assembly in May, 1771, mercifully freed him.<ref target="#CH12-n8">

Two days later <persName>True</persName> was apprehended by <persName>Abel Gold</persName>, a sheriff's deputy, who found stamps for dollars in <persName>True's</persName> possession.

               <p>A further group of suspected counterfeiters of coin and <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> bills was complained of on April 12, 1770, to <persName>Ebenezer Silliman, J.P.</persName>, by Constable <persName>Nehemiah Benedict</persName> of <placeName>Norwalk</placeName> and Constable <persName>Ebenezer</persName> Silliman, Jr., of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>. The persons accused were <persName>James</persName> and <persName>David Hait</persName>, <persName>William Stone</persName>, <persName>John Williamson</persName> and one <persName>How</persName>, alias <persName>Nathan Smith</persName>, alias <persName>Biggelow</persName>, all of <placeName>Stamford</placeName>. <persName>Stone</persName>, <persName>Williamson</persName> and How were arrested, while the others probably fled. Of these three <persName>How</persName> and <persName>Williamson</persName>, at least, were bound over in £100 to the Superior Court and committed to jail when no bail was furnished. Probably <persName>How</persName> escaped from jail with <persName>Wagstaff</persName>. <persName>Williamson</persName> was charged with having made about March 20, 1769, together with How, an English shilling and two Spanish dollars. The only cause for suspicion was that some years before he had lived for two months at the same place as <persName>John True</persName>, a coppersmith of bad character. The grand jury returned his indictment ignoramus and it was ordered that he be dismissed on payment of costs. Since he could not pay these, the Assembly in October, 1770, relieved him of all charges and ordered him released from jail, where he had been held since April 10.<ref target="#CH12-n12">

His indictment was returned ignoramus by the grand jury and

it was ordered that he be discharged on payment of costs amounting to £9/19/9. Since he did not have sufficient money to pay, he petitioned the Assembly in May, 1771, to be relieved of payment, a prayer which was denied.<ref target="#CH12-n13">

               <p>It was discovered on December 27, 1770, that coiners and passers of false dollars and half joes were active in <placeName>Hebron</placeName> and several suspected persons were apprehended and bound over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in March, 1771. They were William Cox, <persName>David Brown</persName>, <persName>John Mattoon</persName>, <persName>Elijah Houghton</persName> and <persName>Amos Fuller, Jr.</persName> Bail for each was set at £200 and bonds in that amount were furnished for <persName>Cox</persName> by himself, Captain <persName>Jedediah Post</persName>, <persName>Samuel Gilbert, Jr.</persName>, and <persName>Nathan Roulee</persName>; for <persName>Houghton</persName> by himself and <persName>Stephen Houghton</persName>; for <persName>Fuller</persName> by <persName>Joel Pratt</persName> of <placeName>Spencer Town</placeName> in <placeName>New York</placeName> and <persName>Daniel Porter, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>Hebron</placeName>. <persName>Houghton</persName> was charged specifically with having made twenty half joes and ten dollars and having passed one dollar to Captain <persName>Benjamin Buel</persName> of <placeName>Hebron</placeName> and another to <persName>John Mattoon</persName> of <placeName>Hebron</placeName>.

               <p>The extreme severity of the sentence in a case involving the counterfeiting of coin, which as a rule had been punished previously by a fine, is explained by the fact that in May, 1771, the Assembly had passed a new law to deal with this offense. The act read:
<q>Be it enacted by the Governor, Council and Representatives, in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, That whosoever hereafter shall counterfeit or make any instrument or instruments for the counterfeiting any of the coins mentioned in the proclamation of her late Majesty Queen <persName>Anne</persName>, for ascertaining the rates of foreign coins in her Majesty's Plantations in <placeName>America</placeName>, or any other gold or silver coins currently passing in this Colony, or shall be aiding or assisting therein, or shall pass, utter or put off any base, false or counterfeit coin within this Colony, knowing the same to be base, false or counterfeit as aforesaid, and be thereof convicted before the Superior Court, shall have his right ear cut off, be branded in the forehead with the letter C on a hot iron, be whipped on the naked body twenty stripes, be imprisoned six months in the common goal in the county where such person shall be convicted, without bail or mainprize, and there be kept to hard labour according to the discretion of the law concerning work-houses, and be fined at the discretion of the court, and pay costs of prosecution. And if such offender or offenders shall not be able to pay such fine and costs of prosecution, said superior court is hereby authorized and fully impowered to assign such person or persons in service for satisfying the same after the expiration of said six months imprisonment.<ref target="#CH12-n21">

Through the efforts of <persName>Oliver Hanchet</persName> information reached King's Attorney <persName>Thomas Seymour</persName> that <persName>Phelps</persName> had made 200 half joes and 200 dollars and offered to put off to one
<pb n="189"/>
                  <persName>Bryant</persName> and others forty half joes and forty dollars. <persName>Benjamin Payne, J.P.</persName>, issued a warrant for the arrest of <persName>Phelps</persName>, who was taken up on December 26, 1771, by Constable <persName>James Bunce</persName> and bound over in £150 to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. He was released on bail furnished by himself and by his brother, <persName>Silvanus Phelps</persName> of <placeName>Hebron</placeName>. At the Superior Court he was indicted for having at <placeName>Hebron</placeName> about November 10, 1770, made a die and other instruments for counterfeiting dollars, half joes and other coins, for having made 100 dollars and 100 half joes, and for having passed ten half joes to <persName>David Brown</persName>. He failed to appear in court when summoned, so that his bond was declared forfeited. The reason for his failure to appear was that four hours after his release on bail in February he was arrested through an attachment and jailed in <placeName>Windham</placeName>.<ref target="#CH12-n22">

He had, he confessed, showed two of the dollar molds at his shop to <persName>Asahel Newton</persName> and <persName>Joseph Chapman</persName>. At <placeName>New London</placeName>, he said, he had passed a false pistareen or an English shilling to Captain <persName>Douglas</persName>, who had refused to accept it.

One evening at <persName>Asahel's</persName> house in <placeName>Colchester</placeName> he (<persName>Chapman</persName>) and <persName>Asahel</persName> ran seven dollars out of pewter, of which he (<persName>Chapman</persName>) passed one to <persName>James Morgan</persName>, who later returned it. According to <persName>Chapman</persName>, <persName>Asahel</persName> had in a chest a mold and twenty or twenty-five counterfeit dollars. <persName>Chapman</persName> was bound over to the Superior Court and released on bail of £100, provided by himself and <persName>Joseph Tubbs</persName> of <placeName>Colchester</placeName>, for his appearance in court in September. He failed, however, to appear and his bond was declared forfeited.<ref target="#CH12-n24">

               </head>
               <p>Sometime in August, 1771, <persName>Oliver Hanchet</persName> and <persName>John Harmon, Jr.</persName>, of Suffield complained to Justices <persName>Samuel Kent</persName> and Alexander King against <persName>John Smith</persName> and William Hurlbutt (or Hulburd), both of Suffield. They were arrested and on them were found counterfeit <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> bills amounting to nearly £100. After being examined by the justices they were bound over, each in bail of £80, to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in September, 1771. <persName>Smith</persName> was released on a bond furnished by Daniel Gillet, <persName>John Southwell</persName>, <persName>James Harmon</persName> and <persName>James Halladay</persName>, all of <placeName>Suffield</placeName>, and <placeName>Hurlbutt</placeName> on a bond provided by <persName>Ebenezer Hurlbutt</persName>, <persName>Abraham Curtiss</persName> and <placeName>William Middleton</placeName>, all of Suffield. Hurlbutt was indicted for having about July 31, 1771, made seventy-eight 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> bills of the emission of December 31, 1763, while <persName>Smith</persName> was indicted for having on October 20 made

plates and instruments for counterfeiting <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> bills; further he was indicted for having struck off 1,000 <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bills dated April 16, 1764, and of <placeName>New York</placeName> bills of the emission of February 16, 1771, the following: one hundred £5, one hundred £1, one hundred 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two hundred £10; a further indictment was for having passed to Jechonias Holcomb of <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> twenty counterfeit 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> bills. In a second indictment he was charged with having made a plate for counterfeiting 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> bills and for having struck off seventy-eight of them. It was also brought out that he had passed a £5 <placeName>New York</placeName> counterfeit to Captain <persName>Elihu Kent</persName>. <persName>Smith</persName> pleaded not guilty and moved for new bail, which was granted in the amount of £150, for which sum <persName>Messers Gillet</persName>, <persName>Southwell</persName>, <persName>Harmon</persName> and <persName>Halladay</persName> "foolishly" gave bond, for when the jury returned with a verdict of guilty, <persName>Smith</persName> had decamped and the bond was declared forfeited. The bondsmen petitioned the Assembly in October that the amount be reduced to £80 but their request was denied. <persName>Hurlbutt</persName> also failed to appear, so that his bond was declared forfeited and two of his bondsmen, <persName>Curtiss</persName> and <persName>Middleton</persName>, were jailed in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. <persName>Middleton</persName> took the oath provided for poor prisoners and was released; when it was reported that Curtiss was planning to do the same but had conveyed his estate into the hands of others, the Assembly ordered an investigation. The third bondsman, <persName>Ebenezer Hurlbutt</persName>, offered to give his bond for £25 payable within one year and his proposition was accepted by the legislators. The informers, Hanchet and Harmon, received £20 as a reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Smith</persName>, however, was taken up again and committed to jail in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> but on January 27, 1772, he escaped, and Sheriff <persName>Ezekiel Williams</persName> had the following notice printed in the <hi rend="italic">

                  <persName>Hurlbutt</persName>, after his failure to appear in court, seems to have gone free for a short time but on November 15, 1771, the King's Attorney, <persName>Thomas Seymour</persName>, issued a complaint against <persName>Hurlbutt</persName>, who was then arrested by <persName>Oliver Hanchet</persName> and taken before Justice <persName>Benjamin Payne</persName>. <persName>Hurlbutt</persName> was bound over in £100 to appear at the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in March, 1772. The prisoner's father and brother, Obediah <persName>Hurlbutt</persName> and <persName>Obediah Hurlbutt, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>Enfield</placeName> provided a bond and <persName>William</persName> was released. Soon, however, they either became apprehensive or laid a plot to enable him to escape, for they had him taken into custody in February, 1772, and secured in the debtor's room in the <placeName>Hartford</placeName> jail, He soon broke out and escaped and his bondsmen petitioned the Assembly to have the forfeited bond abated, a request which the legislators denied.<ref target="#CH12-n25">

                  <persName>Obediah Hurlbutt, Jr.</persName>, on March 20, 1772, prepared an advertisement offering a reward of five dollars and charges for the seizure of his brother. It read in part:

               <p>
                  <persName>William</persName> was eventually taken up and jailed on August 3, 1772, but after about a week he broke jail, in company with others, by the aid of an instrument gotten to him from without, all of which <persName>Oliver Hanchet</persName> considered a trick devised by <persName>Obediah Hurlbutt, Jr</persName>.<ref target="#CH12-n28">
                     <hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                  </ref>
                  <persName>William</persName> then went off to <placeName>New York</placeName>, where he soon fell into the clutches of the law, as will be related later.</p>
               <p>It seems that one of <persName>William's</persName> bondsmen, <persName>Abraham Curtiss</persName>, was probably associated with <persName>Hurlbutt Smith</persName> and the other counterfeiters. <persName>Curtiss</persName> was arrested by <persName>Oliver Hanchet</persName> and <persName>Sylvanus Griswold</persName> and bound over in £100 to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in March, 1772. He obtained bail and then failed to appear in court, so that his bond was forfeited, while his captors were rewarded by the Assembly.<ref target="#CH12-n29">

               <p>It has been seen that <persName>John Smith</persName> was charged with having passed false bills to <persName>Jechonias Holcomb</persName> of <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>. <persName>Holcomb</persName> himself was one of the gang, as it turned out. <persName>Sadoce Wilcox</persName> of that town, discovering that <persName>Holcomb</persName> was knowingly uttering counterfeit <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> bills, seized him and brought him before Justice <persName>John Owen</persName>. The magistrate bound him over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in March, 1772, where <persName>Holcomb</persName> was admitted as King's Witness against <persName>John Smith</persName> and one <persName>Timothy Adams</persName>, while Wilcox was voted a reward of £5 by the Assembly.<ref target="#CH12-n30">

               <p>This <persName>Timothy Adams</persName>, who lived in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>, was indicted at the Superior Court held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> at the end of December, 1771, for having at <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> on or about November 10, 1771, passed a false 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> bill of the emission of April 16, 1764, to <persName>Michael Higley</persName> of <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> and for having passed two more such bills to <persName>Abel Pettibone</persName> of that town. <persName>Adams</persName> pleaded not guilty but was tried, convicted and sentenced in accordance with law.<ref target="#CH12-n31">

               <p>Perhaps connected with the same gang was another <persName>Adams</persName>, this one named <persName>Elisha</persName>, of Coventry. <persName>Timothy Thrall</persName> of <placeName>Windsor</placeName> in November, 1771, informed against him to Justice <persName>John Owen</persName> for counterfeiting and uttering coins and bills. <persName>Adams</persName> was arrested and in the course of his examination admitted his guilt, whereupon he was admitted as King's Witness and the informer was voted a premium of £10 by the Assembly.<ref target="#CH12-n32">

               </p>
               <p>A further probable member of the band was <persName>Richard Stevens</persName> of Sheffield in <placeName>Berkshire County</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. On or about November 10, 1771, in <placeName>Farmington</placeName> he passed to <persName>Elijah Hart</persName> five counterfeit 30<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> bills of <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> and one false 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill of that province. The fraud was apparently soon discovered, and <persName>Isaac Bidwell</persName>, of <placeName>Farmington</placeName>, who about three years before had discovered <persName>Timothy Burbank</persName>, the coiner, and caused him to be convicted, now arrested <persName>Stevens</persName> and brought him before Justice <persName>Solomon Whitman</persName> of <placeName>Hartford</placeName> County. The magistrate bound him over to the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in December and allowed him to be released on bail of £50, furnished by <persName>Stevens</persName> and <persName>Samuel Hide</persName> of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>. <placeName>Stevens</placeName>, however, failed to appear in court, his bond was declared forfeited and the informer, Bidwell, was voted £10 by the Assembly.<ref target="#CH12-n33">

               <p>Perhaps <persName>Simeon</persName> Scripture, who had been convicted of coining in 1769, was connected with <persName>Smith</persName> and his associates. Scripture was arrested, examined and bound over to the Superior Court held in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in December, 1771, at which he was indicted for having on or about October 10 at <persName>Willington</persName>, where he resided, coined twenty half joes and also stamped one hundred false 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. shilling bills of <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>. His case was continued to the September, 1772, term, at which he pleaded that the indictment should be dismissed because he was therein charged with two distinct crimes against two different penal statutes and that because these crimes incurred different and distinct punishments they thus might not be joined in one indictment.
<pb n="195"/>
His case was once more continued and at the January term the indictment was quashed.<ref target="#CH12-n34">

               <p>The widespread counterfeiting in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> County, which was thus detected in 1771, resulted in a number of convictions at the March, 1772, term of the Superior Court. The <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Courant</hi> of Tuesday, March 17, 1772, reported:
<q>Last Friday ended the sitting of the Superior Court for March Term, when the following Persons received sentence, viz. <persName>John Smith</persName> of <placeName>Suffield</placeName>, for counterfeiting <placeName>New-York</placeName> and <placeName>New-Jersey</placeName> Bills, to have his right ear cut off, and be branded on the forehead with the letter C, his estate confiscated, be confined to a workhouse for life, and be kept to hard labour under the care of a master, and that he not depart therefrom, under penalty of being severely whip'd.–Also, <persName>Edward Williams</persName> of <placeName>East Windsor</placeName>, and <persName>Phineas Granger</persName> of <placeName>Suffield</placeName>, for engraving instruments for, and appropriating them to the use of counterfeiting Coin, to have their right ears cut off, and be branded on the forehead with the letter C, be whip'd 20 lashes, and be imprisoned six months, without bail or mainprize, which sentence (except whipping, which was suspended on account of the severity of the weather) was put in execution the next day.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Smith, as has been noted, had escaped from the <placeName>Hartford</placeName> jail on January 27, 1771, and it would seem that now, after sentence had been pronounced, he must presently have escaped, for he was one of a large gang of counterfeiters arrested and tried at a court of oyer and terminer in <placeName>Albany</placeName> County in November, 1772. He was there sentenced to death and was hanged early in 1773.<ref target="#CH12-n35">

               </p>
               <p>Something is known of his life from two letters which he addressed to the printers in <placeName>Albany</placeName> before he was executed on February 8, 1773, as a convicted counterfeiter. His story was printed in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>New-London</placeName> Gazette</hi> of March 19, 1773. He was reared in Huntington County in West Jersey until he reached the age of sixteen. On a
<pb n="196"/>
visit to an elder brother who had married and moved to North Carolina, <persName>John</persName> found the brother living in splendor and resolved to equal him. <persName>John</persName> was by trade a millwright but he now turned to counterfeiting to enrich himself.</p>
               <p>In his thirtieth year he moved to New England, married there and all went well until he was jailed in <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, tried, convicted of counterfeiting and sentenced to be cropped and branded, but broke jail and escaped. Then, filled with a spirit of revenge against society, he went to a master counterfeiter who lived in <placeName>Sheffield</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, <persName>Daniel Lewis</persName>, who supplied him with a quantity of counterfeits. This bad money he took to Cohoss, on the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> River, where he arranged with a certain gentleman to take the false currency and to give horses in return. Upon <persName>Smith's</persName> return, <persName>Lewis</persName> sent him out again with a new supply of counterfeits, and he bought a fine horse with them. On this occasion, however, he was outwitted by the owner of the animal, for this person followed him, accused him of stealing the beast and forced him to settle according to his wishes. <persName>Smith</persName> admitted that a dollar which was sworn on him was false and that he knew this when he passed it and admitted that he had turned to all manner of sin save murder and robbery. On the other hand, he claimed that he had been backed by men of distinction and had been led on in crime.</p>

                  <persName>Edward Williams</persName> of <placeName>East Windsor</placeName> had been seized through the efforts of <persName>Oliver Hanchet</persName> and was indicted for having on or about January 20, 1772, at <placeName>East Windsor</placeName> made 100 instruments called "types" for the purpose of making therewith other instruments called stamps or dies for counterfeiting gold and silver coins and also for making ten stamps for dollars and half joes. <persName>Williams</persName> pleaded not guilty but was tried, convicted and sentenced as was reported in the <hi rend="italic">

In September, 1772, he sent a memorial to the Assembly, showing that his creditors had taken away all his estate, that his wife and three small children were destitute, and that he was continually being exposed to being recaptured.

He pleaded not guilty, was tried and convicted.

                  <persName>William Imus</persName> had been arrested in 1768 for counterfeiting <placeName>New York</placeName> bills, had confessed his guilt and had been admitted as King's Evidence, thereby escaping prosecution. His experience did not cause him to mend his ways, for in February, 1772, he was indicted at the Superior Court in <placeName>Litchfield</placeName> for having on or about September 10 at <placeName>New Milford</placeName> made instruments and stamps and with them coined Spanish milled dollars. He pleaded not guilty, was tried, and a special verdict was returned. This verdict was set aside and the case continued, first until the August term in 1772 and then to the February

The Council for the King now moved <persName>Miles</persName> might be Admitted or rather Compelled to be a Witness for the Crown. It was objected on the other side that the Case being not yet finished, he could not be a Witness, that whatever he should say would either prejudice or Injure him with respect to the Cost. And a Case of <persName>Rex v.

The case was, then, as indicated above, continued until February, 1773.

After his indictment was returned billa vera, he pleaded abatement, on the ground that there were in the indictment various matters that could not be joined.

               <p>Two citizens of <placeName>Norwich</placeName> in 1772 were suspected of being counterfeiters. One of them, <persName>Seth Perry</persName>, the son of <persName>Eliakin Perry</persName>, was twenty-four years old and had a wife and infant child. In January, 1772, he altered a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bill to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and passed it off to <persName>Stephen Bingham</persName> at <placeName>Windham</placeName>. When he came under suspicion, he fled from the colony. His father in May, 1772, sent a memorial to the Assembly, setting forth that he had come from <placeName>Rehoboth</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, but had long lived in <placeName>Norwich</placeName>. He had seven sons still alive, two of whom, <persName>David</persName> and <persName>Sylvanus</persName>, had served in the campaigns against the French. He besought the legislators to permit Seth to live in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> without fear of being prosecuted, and the Assembly, apparently impressed by the military record of <persName>David</persName> and <persName>Sylvanus</persName>, granted his prayer, Seth was permitted to return and not be subject to prosecution on condition that he pay all costs and provide good and sufficient bond for his good and peaceable behavior.<ref target="#CH12-n63">

Some of these he uttered and the rest he returned to the money makers. Apparently he was denounced by <persName>Phelps</persName> and was arrested on July 11, 1772. While he was being examined by <persName>William Williams, J.P.</persName>, of <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, he fled before the end of the questioning and escaped from the colony. His father, <persName>Jonathan Avery, Sr.</persName>, on October 11, 1773, petitioned the Assembly to allow his son to return without fear of prosecution if a bond for good behavior were provided. The request was denied but when father and son made a similar request on May 6, 1774, it was granted, on condition that all costs of prosecution be paid and a bond of £200 be furnished for the younger man's good behavior.<ref target="#CH12-n64">

               <p>In the fall of 1772, probably in October, a search was instituted for <persName>William Underwood</persName> of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName>, who was accused of making and passing Spanish milled dollars. <persName>Nehemiah Tinker</persName> and <persName>Samuel Kennedy</persName>, upon orders of <persName>Elisha Paine</persName>, King's Attorney of <placeName>Windham</placeName> County, went after him to the Cohoss country, where they sought him in vain for ten days. Underwood, however, lay concealed at home all the time and finally went to <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, where he surrendered to the King's Attorney and was admitted as a witness. As a result of his giving evidence several persons were arrested, bound over to the Superior Court and forfeited bonds in the amount of £800 by failing to appear.<ref target="#CH12-n65">

               </p>
               <p>Suspected members of the gang that was broken up through Underwood's revelations were <persName>David Denison</persName>, <persName>Rozel</persName> and <persName>Isaac Morgan</persName>, <persName>Job Fox</persName>, <persName>Tille Parkhurst</persName>, <persName>Benjamin Fuller</persName> and <persName>Nathan Dean</persName>, all of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName>; <persName>Noah</persName> and <persName>Simon Spaulding</persName>, both of <placeName>Scotland</placeName>; <persName>Ebenezer</persName> and <persName>Job Talbot</persName>, both of <placeName>Voluntown</placeName>; <persName>James Flint, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>Windham</placeName>; <persName>Benjamin Hanks, Jr.</persName>, of <placeName>Mansfield</placeName>.</p>
               <p>About the end of October, 1772, <persName>Benjamin Cary</persName>, a grand juror, complained to Justice <persName>Elisha Paine</persName> that <persName>David Denison</persName>, <persName>Rozel Morgan</persName>, <persName>Isaac Morgan</persName>, <persName>Simon Spaulding</persName> and <persName>Job Fox</persName> had made dollars and half joes. The next day, on a warrant issued by <persName>Paine</persName>, <persName>Waterman Cleft</persName> of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName> arrested <persName>Rozel Morgan</persName>, who was bound over in £250 to the March, 1773, term of the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Windham</placeName>. Bail was furnished by <persName>Rozel</persName>, by <persName>Isaac Morgan</persName> of <placeName>Preston</placeName> and by <persName>Tille Parkhurst</persName> of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName>. He could not be tried at this time, so he was bound over to the September term and bail was reduced to £150 that he might not be kept in jail until September. He and his father furnished the bond.<ref target="#CH12-n66">

               <p>
                  <persName>Isaac Morgan</persName> was arrested on December 4, 1772, and brought before Justice <persName>Isaac Coit</persName> of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName>, who bound him over in £200 to appear at the next Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Windham</placeName>. He was released on a bond furnished by himself and <persName>Samuel Wheeler</persName> of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName>. There is no record of <persName>Denison's</persName> being arrested.</p>
               <p>From the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>New-London</placeName> Gazette</hi> of November 20 it is known that <persName>Joseph Eaton</persName>, an officer especially appointed, on October 29 arrested Simon Spaulding, who, however, that same evening escaped from <persName>Eaton</persName>. A reward of £40 was offered for the capture of the fugitive, who was described as "a tall slim strait Man, about 6 Feet high, light Complexion, had on when he went away a mixt coloured blue and white strait bodied Coat, superfine Broadcloth Waistcoat of a radish colour, Buckskin Breeches, mixt colour'd Stockings, his Buckles not Mates, blue Great Coat." For some time he eluded the officers but Deputy Sheriff <persName>Benjamin Lothrop</persName> of <placeName>Windham</placeName> on December 16 set out to apprehend <persName>Simon</persName> and <persName>Noah Spaulding</persName> of <placeName>Scotland</placeName> and on December 29 took up <persName>Simon</persName> and brought him to <placeName>Windham</placeName>.</p>
               <p>More is known of <persName>Job Fox</persName>, who was arrested and brought before Justice <persName>Paine</persName> on October 30 on suspicion of having made dollars and half joes. The magistrate bound him over in £300 to appear at the Superior Court and committed him to jail for want of bondsmen. On December 19, 1772, <persName>Nehemiah Tinker</persName> put out an advertisement offering a reward of thirty dollars for the capture of Job Fox, alias <persName>Benjamin Allwell</persName>, who had broken out of the jail of <placeName>Windham</placeName> County in the night following November 21. The fugitive was described as a very well set fellow of about twenty-three years of age and about five feet eight or nine inches in height. When he escaped he was wearing a broadcloth coat and jacket and breeches and a white woolen shirt. He fled to <persName>Groton</persName>, where he was retaken by <persName>Ebenezer</persName> Gallup of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName> on May 11, 1773. Three friends, or, quite possibly, associates of Fox, namely Roger and <persName>David Fanning</persName>, <persName>Amos Stanton</persName> and <persName>John Cheesborough</persName>, the son of Colonel <persName>Amos Cheesborough</persName> of

Justice <persName>Ephraim Root</persName> issued a warrant for their arrest and they were taken into custody by Deputy Sheriff <persName>Benjamin Lothrop</persName> about December 9. Justice Root bound them over to the Superior Court and they were released on bail of £200 each, furnished for Hanks by <persName>John</persName>, <persName>Uriah</persName> and <persName>Silas Hanks</persName> and <persName>Gershom Hall</persName> and for Flint by himself and <persName>Dr. Joshua Elderkin</persName> of <placeName>Windham</placeName>. <persName>Hanks</persName>, and probably <persName>Flint</persName> also, did not appear in court and their forfeited bonds were very likely part of the sum of £800 in bonds that was forfeited by members of the gang.<ref target="#CH12-n68">

                  <persName>Eli Chapman</persName> on December 28, 1772, complained to Justice <persName>Isaac Coit</persName> that <persName>Tille Parkhurst</persName> of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName> had been counterfeiting half joes and dollars, together with <persName>Nathan Dean</persName>, and had passed some of them. Constable <persName>Joshua Dunlop</persName> arrested <persName>Parkhurst</persName> and took him before Justice <persName>Coit</persName>, who on March 11, 1773, bound him over in £100 to the next term of the Superior Court to be held in <placeName>Windham</placeName>. <persName>Parkhurst</persName> was released on a bond furnished by himself, <persName>Abraham Shepard</persName> and <persName>Joseph Shepard</persName>.

               <p>Deputy Sheriff <persName>Lothrop</persName> on January 1, 1773, went to <placeName>East Haddam</placeName> after <persName>Dean</persName>, who was charged with having counterfeited at <placeName>Plainfield</placeName> on August 1, 1772, and at other times twenty half joes and fifty Spanish milled dollars. As the King's Attorney was unable to apprehend him, <persName>Dean</persName> finally came in and gave himself up on a proposal that he would be admitted as a witness for the crown. He was, then, so admitted, was bound over in £100 and was released on a bond provided by himself and Moses Barnet of <placeName>Plainfield</placeName>. On February 16 he was sworn as a witness against <persName>Benjamin Fuller</persName> and <persName>Job Talbot</persName>. It was found, however, that his evidence was insufficient to convict any other person, yet, upon the evidence that happened to be present, the grand jury indicted Dean. On March 19, 1773, a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was taken up by <persName>Paul Hébard</persName>, a sheriff's deputy. Since it appeared to the court that Dean had been used as a witness and that the public faith was pledged, the justices were of the opinion that he should be released and they ordered the King's Attorney to enter a <hi rend="italic">nol. pros.</hi>

The first counterfeiter to be sentenced in accordance with the new act was apparently <persName>Elisha Barber</persName> of <placeName>Pomfret</placeName>. <persName>John Richardson</persName> a grand juror, complained, sometime in 1774, to Justice <persName>John Grosvenor</persName> that <persName>Elisha Barber</persName> and <persName>Hezekiah Griggs</persName> had in the spring of that year made a dollar mold, cast some coins and passed them.

Nothing further, is recorded about <persName>Griggs</persName>, so he may have failed to appear or possibly been accepted as King's Evidence against <persName>Barber</persName>. <persName>Barber</persName> was indicted, pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to a term of two years in <placeName>Newgate Prison</placeName>.

               <hi rend="bold">XIII CONCLUSION</hi>
            </head>
            <p>In <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> during the Colonial Period the names of some three hundred and fifty counterfeiters or suspected counterfeiters have been recorded. Of these some were innocent and some lived outside the colony but forged its bills. Doubtless there were many others engaged in the nefarious business who escaped detection and arrest. At the close of the seventeenth century, to judge by the testimony of <persName>Robert Fenton</persName>, a number of individuals in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> were engaged in making and passing false coin. Despite the laws and the efforts of the authorities the number of counterfeiters grew along with the population. In some instances the malefactors worked alone or together with a few associates but little by little large gangs came into being and formed an extensive underworld of highly organized money makers. People like Owen Sullivan were methodical: "he provided himself with a secret retreating Place, and a Set of Accomplices for vending the Money that had been, or should be made by him, and supplying Necessaries, Conveniencies and Correspondents for putting the Business upon a regular Footing, and living comfortably upon it." And there were many others like Sullivan. A few years before the Revolution Justice <persName>William B. Whiting</persName> of <placeName>Albany</placeName> County wrote of the "great Numbers that were connected in carrying on the business undiscovered &amp; in the Dark and which was a Deep Laid Plan for to have the several Governments Ruined in their Commerce and in Perticular the Government of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>."</p>
            <p>A few of the money makers came from England or elsewhere in Europe with a criminal past. Many were violent men, who lived most irregular lives and took pleasure in crime—one need only read the confession of Gilbert Belcher, the silversmith, or consider the lawless
<pb n="216"/>
conduct of <persName>David Sandford</persName> and his gang, who terrorized whole communities, or the gangster tactics of <persName>Isaac Jones</persName>, <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>, <persName>Owen Sullivan</persName> or <persName>John Wall</persName>. Others who became counterfeiters were living a hand to mouth existence and were tempted by the wiles of the professional criminals: Tucker, a blacksmith, said that his estate consisted mainly of his tools; <persName>John</persName> Carpenter was heavily in debt; <persName>Seth Porter</persName> and <persName>John Mallet</persName> had signed a bond and were in great financial distress to make it good; Caleb Strong was burdened with debts and had a wife and numerous children to support; <persName>Nathaniel Barns's</persName> lands were mortgaged; <persName>Lewis Bennett</persName> was very poor and had a wife and several small children; <persName>Edward Williams</persName>' creditors seized all his estate; <persName>Elias Wilcox</persName> was poor, crippled and had five children and had been deserted by his wife; <persName>Zephaniah Spicer</persName> was young, poor, and had a sickly wife and two small children. Such are a few examples of those who were easily led to try their hand at "making" money. A few persons, however, were men "of estate and character," such as <persName>Abel Buel</persName>, the Greenmans in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, and <persName>Joseph Avery</persName>. A number of persons, <persName>William Robinson</persName>, <persName>Solomon Bill</persName>, <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>, <persName>William Barker</persName>, <persName>Ebenezer Seamore</persName>, <persName>Ovid Rushbrook</persName>, <persName>John Smith</persName>, for example, were fascinated by counterfeiting and seemingly could not let it alone.</p>
            <p>The occupations of almost fifty of the counterfeiters are known. It is not surprising that a number were workers in metal: eight were blacksmiths, three were silversmiths' and two must have been either blacksmiths or silversmiths; <persName>John True</persName> was a coppersmith, <persName>Joseph Steel</persName> a refiner of pig metal and <persName>Henry Dawkins</persName> an engraver. Four were physicians, two were mariners, two were masters of sloops, three were tavernkeepers, two were saddlers, two were shopkeepers, one was a tailor, one a joiner, one a miller, one a shoemaker, one a mason, one a weaver, one a shingle maker, one a maker of sundials, one a trader, one a laborer, five were farmers, one was a justice of the peace in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, and one, <persName>Samuel Weed</persName>, seems to have been a farmer who later wished to become a leather dresser.</p>
            <p>It was by no means easy to secure the indictment or conviction of
<pb n="217"/>
counterfeiters, and this doubtless encouraged the crime. In <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> some twenty-four had their indictments returned ignoramus by the grand jury. Sixteen cases are recorded where the King's Attorney was unwilling to prosecute, and the indictment of one, <persName>Simeon</persName> Scripture, was quashed. Some sixteen men are known to have escaped prosecution by being admitted as witnesses for the Crown, and it should be noted that one of the surest methods of securing the conviction of a counterfeiter was to induce an accomplice to bear witness against him. Twenty-one persons were tried and acquitted, though many seem to have been guilty and to have escaped through legal technicalities or want of sufficient evidence at the time. Eight individuals were dismissed by a magistrate or court for want of evidence or some other reason. In <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> two escaped by pleading benefit of clergy and had their thumbs burned. For those, however, who could secure bondsmen the favorite means of avoiding the consequences of their crimes was to forfeit bail by not appearing in court. As a rule they were then no further molested and got off without corporal punishment or imprisonment, while their bondsmen paid the amount of the bonds. Forty-six persons escaped punishment by this device. To make matters worse, the bondsmen usually tried to induce the Assembly to reduce the amount of the bonds, and the leniency of the legislators in this regard frequently defeated the ends of justice and led relatives and friends to sign bonds that were too large for them to pay. Of the forty-six bonds that were forfeited, the following were ordered to be chancered down as follows: that of <persName>Shubael Rowly, Jr.</persName>, from £40 to £36; of <persName>Joseph Waterhouse</persName> from £300 to £150; of <persName>Samuel Sherman</persName> from £300 to such an amount as would cover costs and the £20 reward to the informer; of <persName>Benjamin Beardslee</persName> from £50 to £25; of <persName>Israel Beardslee</persName> from £300 to £50; of <persName>Peter Smith</persName> from £100 to £50; of Odel Squire from £130 to nothing on condition that costs and charges were paid; of <persName>Amos Tyler</persName> from £60 to £20; of <persName>Ebenezer Jackson, Jr</persName>., from £60 to £30; of <persName>Caleb Strong</persName> from £100 to nothing; of <persName>John Carpenter</persName> from £300 to £132; of <persName>Edward Cogswell</persName> from £50 to £25; of <persName>Henry Vorse</persName> from
<pb n="218"/>
£50 to £20; of <persName>Peletiah Turner</persName> from £60 to £20; of <persName>Hubbard Brown</persName> from £300 to £10; of <persName>Daniel Sturges</persName>, 3rd, from £500 to £100; of <persName>Seth Porter</persName> from £1,000 to £225.</p>
            <p>The jails of the time were notoriously weak and many counterfeiters had a record of successful escapes from jail or from officers of the law, some of them on more than one occasion. Thirty-six persons are known to have broken jail and probably five others managed to make such escapes, while the names of still others are not recorded. Six individuals, at least, fled before they could be taken.</p>
            <p>Some eighty persons, however, were convicted and punished in one way or another for the crime of counterfeiting. The penalties meted out depended, of course, upon the laws in effect at the time and, to some degree, upon the discretion of the judges. In 1710 it was enacted that those convicted of counterfeiting the bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> should pay all damages, be imprisoned for six months and suffer such other penalty or corporal punishment as the court might inflict; one half of any fine was to go to the treasury and one half to whoever prosecuted the case. In May of the next year a new law provided that convicted counterfeiters not only of bills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> but also of those of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> were to be imprisoned for six months and suffer such other fine, penalty or corporal punishment as the court might decide. Any fine was to go to the treasury and the informer was to receive a reward of £20, which about 1750 was reduced to £10. Any alterer of bills or forger of signers' names was to be punished as provided in the legislation against forgery and was further to pay treble damages to all persons injured. The penalty for knowingly passing was the same as for counterfeiting.</p>
            <p>In May, 1717, the Assembly provided that all false, altered or counterfeit bills should be seized by the treasurer of the colony or any assistant or justice of the peace. The last two were empowered to require the person from whom the bill was taken to enter his name on the back of the bill and declare the person from whom he received the bill and to investigate the matter further. In May, 1720, the
<pb n="219"/>
Assembly provided that any counterfeiter of coin or person knowingly passing false coin was on conviction to be imprisoned for six months and suffer such fine or corporal punishment as was decided by the court.</p>
            <p>Four years later the legislators greatly increased the severity of the penalties for counterfeiters or passers of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> bills or those of the other New England colonies and <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>. Upon conviction offenders were to have the right ear cut off, be branded on the forehead with C, be committed to the workhouse for life, have all property confiscated and be forever debarred from trading or dealing in the colony. This law was in effect until October, 1773. The harshness of life imprisonment was greatly mitigated by the practice on the part of the Assembly of freeing many convicts after a comparatively short imprisonment.</p>
            <p>The penalty for coining or passing false coin had been much lighter than in the case of bills and had not been changed since the enactment of the law of 1720. In May, 1771, however, it was provided that a person convicted of such offenses was to have his right ear cut off, be branded on the forehead with C, be whipped twenty stripes, be imprisoned for six months, pay a fine at the discretion of the court and pay costs of prosecution.<ref target="#CH13-n1">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>A final change was made in October, 1773, when it was enacted that counterfeiters of bills or coin that was current or passers of false bills or coin were to be imprisoned for a first offense in Newgate Prison for a term not exceeding ten years and for a second offense for life in the same prison. Further this act was not to exempt any persons sentenced under it from pecuniary penalties, forfeitures or disabilities to which such an offender was heretofore made liable by any laws of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.</p>
            <p>A term of even so short a period as six months in a county jail was no light matter, especially in winter, as the Assembly recognized when it permitted <persName>Joseph Elderkin</persName> and <persName>Timothy Parkhurst</persName> to begin
<pb n="220"/>
their sentences of six months each at such a time of the year that the prison and weather would allow them to be imprisoned without danger of hazarding their health. <persName>William Barker</persName> stated that he broke out of the jail in <placeName>New Haven</placeName> "as he was like to freeze to death." <persName>Thomas Wagstaff</persName> feared the hardships of a winter in prison and <persName>Aaron Wilcox</persName> complained of "chilling cold" and "pinching hunger." <persName>Ephraim Sheevie</persName> complained of his suffering in chains in a stinking, nasty jail, infested with vermin, unheated in March and April, with no straw to sleep on and only bread and water for fare. Similarly <persName>Jonathan Richardson</persName> and <persName>Edward Aldrich</persName> wrote of the "pinching hunger" and only the "naked floor" beneath them, while <persName>Amos Fuller</persName> maintained that his health was gravely endangered. <placeName>Newgate Prison</placeName>, a former copper mine under the ground, was still more of a risk to health of mind and body and it afforded no possibility of escape.</p>
            <p>It is, then, small wonder that the Assembly as a rule released convicted counterfeiters after a short time, especially as it was expensive to feed them in jail and also as in most instances their families became town charges. <persName>John Andrews</persName>, who was jailed in September to serve a term of six months, was set free in October. <persName>Ephraim Sheevie</persName>, <persName>Hezekiah Cox</persName>, <persName>Jonathan Richardson</persName>, <persName>Edward Aldrich</persName>, <persName>Jeremiah Thornton</persName> and <persName>Thomas Cooper</persName> were released with the understanding that they must leave the colony forever. <persName>Elisha Parker</persName>, <persName>Robert Martyn</persName>, <persName>Daniel Tucker</persName>, <persName>Nathaniel Wooster</persName>, <persName>Samuel Weed</persName>, <persName>Aaron Wilcox</persName>, <persName>Amos Fuller</persName>, <persName>Jedediah Cady</persName>, <persName>John Clark</persName>, <persName>Abel Buel</persName>, <persName>John Mallet</persName>, <persName>Lewis Bennett</persName> and <persName>Thomas Wagstaff</persName> were let go free after short periods but confined to the limits of their respective towns. <persName>Hugh Gillespy</persName> was released on condition that he enlist in the army or navy and <persName>Zephaniah Spicer</persName> on condition that he enlist for the expedition against Crown Point. <persName>Solomon Bill</persName>, who was jailed until he should pay a fine of £20 and costs, obtained his discharge by giving a bond for the amount to be paid. <persName>Elisha Barber</persName>, <persName>John Morriss</persName> and <persName>Jonas Mace, Jr</persName>., all were released from <placeName>Newgate</placeName> long before their terms were served.</p>
            <p>A considerable number of persons charged with counterfeiting were sold for a period of time to pay costs or charges or fines. <persName>Joseph
<pb n="221"/>
Steel</persName>, <persName>Michael Falshaw</persName> and <persName>William Severs</persName> were thus sold to satisfy the costs in their cases; <persName>Jeremiah Lisha</persName> had to serve two years to pay costs in his case; <persName>Odel Squire</persName> was ordered to serve five years to pay costs of £24/8/10; <persName>Caesar Trick</persName> was sold for eight years to pay damages of £24 and costs of £9/—/6; an Indian woman named <persName>Mary</persName> was sold for fifteen years to satisfy costs of £15/19/10; <persName>Joseph Munsel's</persName> services were considered more valuable, for he had to serve a year and a half to pay costs of £13/1/7; <persName>Nathan Baxter</persName> was assigned in service to his brother for two years to pay costs of £22/2/1; <persName>Samuel Falshaw</persName> was to serve four years to pay a fine of £60 and the charges in his case; <persName>Benjamin Swan</persName> was assigned in service for five years to <persName>William Parke</persName> to pay a fine of £20 and costs but <persName>Swan</persName> first fell sick and, when he recovered, joined the army and went to <placeName>Crown Point</placeName>, where he died of the smallpox.</p>
            <p>The reward of £20, and later £10, for informers against counterfeiters was a considerable inducement and led to the capture of many malefactors. Sometimes a special premium might be given, for the Assembly granted Ephraim Seeley £50 for helping to detect <persName>Joseph Boyce</persName> and <persName>Scias</persName>. Persons who especially distinguished themselves in pursuing counterfeiters and breaking up gangs of money makers were <persName>Robert Clark</persName>, <persName>Eliphalet Beecher</persName>, <persName>Isaac Warner</persName>, <persName>Isaac Bidwell</persName>, <persName>Isaac Cotton</persName>, and <persName>Oliver Hanchet</persName>.</p>
            <p>Counterfeiting was a constant threat to the credit of the bills of the colony and to trade and commerce within <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and between that colony and other provinces. In addition individuals from time to time suffered serious loss through receiving false money. For example, bad dollars passed by <persName>Nathaniel</persName> Fales about 1751 completely ruined two honest men and caused a number of others to suffer greatly. In May, 1713, the Assembly ordered that because so many bills had been altered the old emission should be called in and replaced with new bills containing special devices to protect them. In many instances the total amount of money altered or counterfeited was not great but sometimes vast amounts were turned out. Owen Sullivan seems to have made several hundreds of thousands of pounds; Caesar Trick
<pb n="222"/>
made a large amount of bogus money; <persName>Macdonald</persName> brought in £100,000 in counterfeits from <persName>Europe</persName> and <persName>Robert Neal</persName> imported more than £2,500 of them; <persName>John Smith</persName> and <persName>Hurlbutt</persName> made considerable sums; <persName>Oliver Hanchet</persName> took some £550 in bad bills on <persName>Lemuel Gusten</persName>. Some counterfeits were cunningly made and difficult to detect but in general it seems that there were always many persons so ignorant or careless that the crudest forgeries could pass among them. The outbreak of the Revolution and the printing of counterfeits by the British and their distribution by Tories gave new impetus to the operations of money makers which had already grown to alarming proportions in the British colonies during the Colonial Period.</p>
