            <p>
               <placeName>Canada's</placeName> money provided the subject for the seventh annual Coinage of the Americas Conference sponsored by the American
               Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing Council as a forum for the
               dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of <placeName>North and South America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present
               papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all interested in the
               topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants to come to know the Society's collections and library
               better during the days of the conference.</p>
            <p>A special exhibit of Canadian money was organized by <persName>Anthony Terranova</persName> with the assistance of modern curator <persName>Dr. John Kleeberg</persName> and registrar <persName>Katharina Eldada</persName>. This exhibit showed selections from the
               collections of <persName>Joseph Lasser</persName>, <persName>Anthony Terranova</persName>, <persName>George Cuhaj</persName>, and
                  <persName>Normand Pepin</persName>, plus examples from the collection of the ANS. A special exhibit on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> 125 Coin Program was provided through the courtesy of the Royal Canadian Mint.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The American Numismatic Society can justifiably claim that it has long had an interest in Canadian numismatics. The very second donation ever
               received by the Society, accession number 1858.2, on May 25, 1858, included a sou issued by the Banque du Peuple of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, the gift of <persName>Edward Groh</persName>. In those days, interest in United States
               numismatics and Canadian numismatics grew hand-in-hand. This continued in the 1890s, after the formation of the American Numismatic Association.
               The first vice-president of the American Numismatic Association, <persName>Joseph Hooper</persName>, was a native of <placeName>Ontario</placeName>. <persName corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</persName> was almost invariably in attendance at ANA conventions,
               which were held in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> twice: in 1909 and 1923. One Canadian has also served as
               president of the American Numismatic Association: <persName>J. Douglas Ferguson</persName>.</p>
            <p>It is regrettable that the citizens of the respective countries have begun to concentrate on their own coinages to the exclusion of all else, and
               have turned away from the eclecticism of the early days. There was a good reason for that eclecticism: it reflected the circulating medium of the
               time. The collectors of the 1850s put together their first collections out of circulation, and a <persName>Mickley</persName> or a <persName>Groh</persName> was as likely to receive a Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> front view token in
               change as a <persName>Nova Eborac</persName>. Thus even the collector who is interested exclusively in the numismatics of the United States
               cannot ignore the Canadian series, for in the early part of the nineteenth century it was as much a part of United States coinage as it was part
               of <placeName>Canada's</placeName>. There are some sections of the United States where this continued to be the case even after the great
               recoinage of 1857. <placeName>Michigan</placeName> is the obvious example. A rather drastic example of the predominance of Canadian coppers in
               circulation in <placeName>Michigan</placeName> is provided by the <placeName>Delton</placeName>, <placeName>Michigan</placeName> (1899)
               hoard. In the darkest days of the Civil War a great fear gripped the Middle West, and this is reflected in the large number of hoards buried
               about this time. The <placeName>Delton</placeName>, <placeName>Michigan</placeName> hoard closes in 1862 and probably was buried soon <pb n="x"/> after that date, in a woodpile near the right-of-way of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>, <placeName>Kalamazoo &amp; Saginaw</placeName> Railroad. It consisted of 119 copper coins; of those coppers, no fewer than 93 were of Canadian
               origin. There were only 15 United States large cents, along with various oddities, such as one Chinese cash coin.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> We
               should not be surprised that people would hoard copper in 1862: it had disappeared from circulation to such an extent that it had to be replaced
               by government issued fractional currency or privately issued scrip. The disappearing copper had to go somewhere, and it did—into hoards. The
               Aaron White hoard is another famous example.</p>
            <p>The importance of Canadian numismatics for the collector interested in the United States in the early nineteenth century is very great.
               Counterfeiters did not suddenly disappear once the <placeName>United States Mint</placeName> began business. Yet we have to explain why there
               are so comparatively few contemporary circulating counterfeits of large cents. One answer, of course, is that some of the so-called
               "noncollectible large cents" may well be contemporary counterfeits: one highly educated dealer, <persName>James G. Macallister</persName>,
               thought the strawberry leaf cents were contemporary counterfeits, and he probably was right. But counterfeiters in the early nineteenth century
               had an easier option than counterfeiting large cents. They could instead counterfeit <persName>George II</persName> halfpence, which
               circulated almost as freely. <persName>Eric P. Newman</persName> has pointed out that what we commonly think of as "colonials" circulated in
               the <placeName>United States</placeName> up until 1857-64.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> This means that counterfeit halfpence, whether
               attributed to <placeName>Machin's</placeName>
               <persName>Mills</persName> or elsewhere, illicit Connecticut coppers, all sorts of parts of the "colonial" series which do not quite fit in,
               may have been produced later, perhaps much later. <persName>John Lorenzo</persName> has made the very attractive suggestion that the cast
                  <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> copper with the date of 1776 might have actually been produced around the same time and by the same
               methods as the Canadian Blacksmith coppers.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> The specimen in the ANS collection, which we received in 1988 as the
               gift of Herbert Oechsner, seems to confirm this; it has the same sort of uneven, "rice pudding-like" surface which many Canadian Blacksmith
               coppers do.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>United States</placeName> researcher faces great problems in dating these coins. The story is told of <persName corresp="#viaf_109772791">Margaret Thompson</persName>, who, when asked to date a New Style tetradrachm, replied, "somewhere between 229 B.C. and
               the time of Augustus."<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> The <placeName>United States</placeName> researcher, when asked the date of production of
               a <persName>George II</persName> counterfeit of <placeName>North American</placeName> origin, could just as easily reply, "somewhere
               between 1727 and 1862." The Canadian series may provide the means of dating these counterfeit coppers. Many of the Canadian <pb n="xi"/> tokens
               have nineteenth century dates; and there is great difference in the weight standards. We can follow the debasement of copper in the Canadian
               tokens, even if we cannot follow it in the large cents. Further metrological analysis of some of the difficult parts of the colonial series,
               which could then be compared to coins in the Canadian series, might help us date "colonials" more accurately.</p>

               <p>1991 marked the 350th anniversary of the settlement of Montreal. In 1992 we celebrate the 130th anniversary of the founding of the Numismatic
                  Society of Montreal. It is, therefore, fitting that the ANS mark both the establishment of permanent French settlements in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and their sister society's foundation with a conference dedicated to our northern neighbor's
                  monetary history. Appropriately, this first paper of the conference will discuss <placeName>Canada's</placeName> first coinage, the issues
                  for La Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>.</p>
               <p>French <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> had a rich coinage history, but one that was confusing to contemporaries
                  and is not well understood by today's collectors. The fundamental question of where to start a collection, what to include as French colonial
                  issues, should be easy to answer. It is fairly simply resolved for collectors of American colonial coins. Unfortunately, this is the single
                  most controversial question in French-Canadian numismatics and has been so for the past century and more. There is no consensus of what
                  constitutes the body of coins struck for <placeName>French</placeName>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and there has not been one since the early decades of the 20th century. From the
                  foundation of the Numismatic Society of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> (1862, renamed the Numismatic and
                  Antiquarian Society of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> four years later) to today, numismatists have wrangled
                  over this question.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> Since no resolution of the problem satisfactory to everyone was achieved by better students
                  than I, such as <persName corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</persName>, the reader should not expect one in these pages.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A short review of the major highlights in the historiography of French-Canadian numismatics will place the problem at hand in some
                  perspective. When <persName>Alfred Sandham</persName> composed his pamphlet on the coins of the Dominion of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and the provinces in 1869 he did not specifically include any struck during the Ancien Regime.
                  Instead, he reprinted observations from two travellers' journals that described French coins then in circulation, along with a short
                  description of the card money.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref>
                  <persName>Sandham</persName> was a promoter of new and curious tokens who particularly aroused <persName>McLachlan's</persName> ire.
                  It can be supposed that <persName>Sandham</persName> would not have missed a chance at popularizing issues that he could later have
                  offered for sale. <persName>McLachlan</persName> named <persName>Sandham</persName> as one of the "...wholesale importers...who
                  included over twenty-five exotics... [in his catalogue]," and went on to call <persName>Leroux</persName>, <persName>Atkins</persName>, and <persName>Batty</persName> "...great <pb n="3"/> sinners in this direction, as they included in their lists,
                  besides all former claims, many of their own introduction."<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Although <persName>Sandham</persName> was more interested in copper tokens and was something of a <persName>Francophobe</persName>,
                  his failure to notice the 1670 silver and copper issues is somewhat surprising, since they had been mentioned in the collectors' press three
                  years earlier. The August 1866 issue of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> had carried a notice of these coins,
                  quoting extracts from <persName>Le Blanc's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Traité historique des monnoyes de <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>
                  </hi> (1690).<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
                  <persName>Sylvester S. Crosby</persName> reprinted the 1866 <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> notice in his <hi rend="italic">The Early Coins of
                     America,</hi> saying that he had seen only the smaller silver coin, in <persName>William Sumner</persName> Appleton's collection.<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
                  <persName>James Stevenson's</persName> essay "The Currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> After the
                  Capitulation" (1877) did not mention any French minor coin, but did include the tariff published as part of General <persName>Murray's</persName> proclamation of January 1, 1765, which rated <persName>French Louis</persName> d'ors at £1/8 in currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Eleven years after they were first reported in the pages of the <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi>, the journal carried Professor <persName>Charles E. Anthon's</persName> article "The <persName>Gloriam Regni</persName>."<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref>
                  <placeName>Anthon's</placeName> study drew collectors' attention more closely to the issues of 1670 in an authoritative and convincing way.
                  His contribution seemed to legitimize the "<persName>Gloriam regni</persName>" issues as collectable French-Canadian coins. The
                  circulation of the journal into many Canadian numismatic and antiquarian societies' libraries ensured that the "<persName>Gloriam
                     Regni</persName>" coinage would become better appreciated in the country for which it was originally intended.</p>
               <p>In 1892 <persName>�mile Zay</persName>, a member of the Soci�t� française de numismatique (whose journal may have inspired <persName>J. N. T. Levick</persName> with the idea of creating the <hi rend="italic">AJN),</hi> published his <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                     mon�taire des colonies françaises d'apr�s les documents officiels</hi>.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> Under the section specifically named
                  "Colonies de l'Am�rique" <persName>Zay</persName> listed and illustrated the 1670 silver and copper issues (his numbers 1-3) as French
                  coins struck for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. More importantly, Zay gave the texts of the arr�ts that
                  originally authorized these issues. He included the 6 and 12 deniers of 1717 struck at Perpignan (his numbers 4-5) as other French coins
                  struck for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. He also gave a long and still very useful selection of documents
                  concerning the card money issues of 1685-1757. <persName>Zay's</persName> catalogue was and still is extremely influential.<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> It should be noted, however, that <persName>Zay</persName> did not attribute the 1670 or 1717 issues as
                  exclusively "Canadian."</p>
               <p>In a footnote explaining the origin of the worn billon flans that were to be counterstamped with a crowned "C" for the <persName>French colony</persName> of <persName>Cayenne</persName>, <persName>Zay</persName> illustrated and discussed the billon sols and <pb n="4"/> demi-sols of the 1738 issue, calling these "marqu�s."<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref>
                  <persName>Zay</persName> noted a <placeName>Quebec</placeName> ordinance of 1744 that fixed the values of "anciens sols marqu�s" at
                  the then official homeland rate of 18 deniers. He did not document a contemporary use of the term "sols marqu�s" for the 1738 issue, and it is
                  quite likely that he so named them based upon the wording of the 1744 <placeName>Quebec</placeName> ordinance he quoted.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> That an issue first struck only six years earlier, was contemporaneous with the 1744 ordinance, and would be
                  coined for a further 20 years, suggests that the "anciens sols marqu�s" referred to in 1744 were some other species of coinage and not the
                  1738 billon sols and demi-sols.</p>
               <p>On the other side of the Atlantic in 1892 <persName>Dr. Joseph Leroux</persName> published the second, expanded edition of his <hi rend="italic">The Canadian Coin Cabinet.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>
                  <persName>Leroux</persName> adopted <persName>Zay's</persName> listings of the 1670 and 1717 Perpignan issues and called them
                  French-Canadian (<persName>Leroux</persName> 250-252c). He noted that his illustrations of these types "...are taken from <persName>Zay's</persName> work."<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> Immediately following the Perpignan coppers <persName>Leroux</persName> included the 1721-22 nine deniers issues as French-Canadian, which <persName>Zay</persName> had listed in the "Colonies

                     "<persName>John Law</persName>'s Serie[s/c]" (which was not in <persName>Zay's</persName> work and may represent the earliest
                  appearance of "<persName>John Law</persName>'s coins" in the French-Canadian corpus), listing what he called the 20 livres, 1 livre, 10
                  sols, and six deniers of 1720-A, as well as the 3 deniers of 1721-B (<persName>Leroux</persName> 254b-g, 254e being omitted for some
                  reason). In <persName>Leroux</persName>' catalogue there were a total of 12 different issues that he concluded were French-Canadian.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref>

               <p>Two years after <persName>Zay's</persName> and <persName>Leroux</persName>' catalogues appeared, <persName>Pierre Napoleon

                  <persName>Breton's</persName> catalogue drew on his two, earlier illustrated pamphlets, but in the Preface, Breton acknowledged his debt
                  to <persName>Zay's</persName> earlier work and said "The history of the coins and jetons issued under the French Regime is taken from
                     [<persName>Zay's</persName> work]. In giving credit to Mr. <persName>Zay</persName> for the interesting notes brought together in

                     <persName>Zay's</persName> text concerning the card money nearly verbatim, without noting this additional debt to Zay. <persName>Leroux</persName>' name is notably absent from <persName>Breton's</persName> acknowledgements and the biography <persName>Breton</persName> included only thinly covered his resentment of <pb n="5"/>

               <p>
                  <persName>Breton</persName> included <persName>Zay's</persName> nos. 1-5 as his own 501-5- Under his section "Colonies en <persName>Général"</persName>
                  <persName>Zay</persName> had included the 9 deniers coppers of 1721 and 1722, and a footnote concerning the sols and demi-sols of 1738,
                  noting that these issues circulated in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref>
                  <persName>Breton</persName> adopted these other three as French-Canadian coins and listed them in his catalogue as nos. 506-9.<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> In the short space of 28 years, therefore, the corpus of French-Canadian coins had grown from An-thon's three

                     <persName>Breton's</persName> influence upon the course of French-Canadian numismatics has been extraordinary. Most collectors today
                  assume that if an issue appeared in <persName>Breton</persName> it was thereby a legitimate Canadian collectable. Few have ever taken the
                  time to trace <persName>Breton's</persName> sources for the coins and tokens he listed.</p>
               <p>The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw something of a renaissance in the study of Canadian numismatic history. <persName corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</persName>'s articles on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> medal

               </head>
               <p>As we have seen, the growing enthusiasm for Canadian <pb n="6"/> numismatics had had a distinctly inflationary effect upon the number and
                  types of coins believed to be French-Canadian. <persName>McLachlan</persName> recognized this trend and, in a series of articles in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> and elsewhere, he pointedly set out to deflate the listings popularized by <persName>Leroux</persName> and <persName>Breton</persName>. In an address to the 1912 American Numismatic Association convention, <persName>McLachlan</persName> discussed seven kinds of what he called "fake" Canadian coins.<ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> The last
                  category was "Foreign Coins," which included "British nineteenth century tokens, French coins and medals, besides coins of the other British
                  colonies..." which, he said, "...have been drawn upon to increase the number of Canadians, each successive cataloguer adding one or more to
                  those previously appropriated."<ref target="#CH2-n26">26</ref> These additions, he felt, were made both by design as well as in the interests
                  of Canadian numismatics, but their effect had been not only to increase the corpus of Canadian coins, but also the prices asked for the new
                  additions. Speaking of the sols and demi-sols of 1738, which were by then universally called "sou marques" (<persName>Breton</persName>
                  508, 509), <persName>McLachlan</persName> said "As a consequence [of their addition], these comparatively common French coins sell in
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> for high, in fact, extravagant prices. Only the other day a collector in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> was asked $50. for a half soumarque."<ref target="#CH2-n27">27</ref> After
                  reviewing those coins and tokens listed by <persName>Breton</persName> as Canadian, <persName>McLachlan</persName> stated "we would
                  thus exclude from <persName>Breton's</persName> list alone five false coins, sixteen fictitious ones, ninety-seven fabrications, twenty
                  mules, and thirty-five foreigners, or a total of 172," and answered his critics' objections to this winnowing by concluding "better that your
                  collection be emasculated than that it should contain a lot of mere modern junk."<ref target="#CH2-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Two years later, in his brief 1914 review of the history of <placeName>Canada's</placeName> money, <persName>McLachlan</persName> was
                  notably silent concerning all French issues but the 1670 and 1717 coinages.<ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref> The next year <persName>McLachlan</persName> expanded his historical review, still omitting the 1721-22 and 1738 issues listed by <persName>Breton</persName>,
                  but now also passing over the 1717 Perpignan six and 12 deniers.<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref> Why he excluded them in 1915 is, perhaps, to
                  be explained by his choice of words when he described the 1670 issues as being "...especially struck for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>...." Although <persName>Zay</persName> had included the 1717 issue as American, <persName>McLachlan</persName> may have felt it did not pertain "especially" to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>
                  since it was authorized for all French colonies in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, including <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> and the island possessions. The same may have been said for the 1670 coinage, as well, but
                     <persName>McLachlan</persName> seems to have ignored this fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>McLachlan</persName> saved his most specific and detailed attack against the inflationary tendency for his war-time article
                  "The Sou Marque Not a Canadian Coin."<ref target="#CH2-n31">31</ref>
                  <persName>McLachlan</persName> reviewed the evidence printed by <pb n="7"/>
                  <persName>Zay</persName> and adopted by <persName>Breton</persName> and argued that the sou marque and its fraction should not be
                  classed as colonial coins even in general unless they bore a crowned C counterstamp, and then only as issues for the French West Indies
                     possessions.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref> Speaking of a suggestion he had recently read in Mehl's <hi rend="italic">Numismatic
                     Monthly</hi> that would have included all dates and mints of the sou marques, <persName>McLachlan</persName> stated: <q>If, therefore,
                     this suggestion be accepted, we would have to include in our Canadian series, all dates of this coinage extending over twenty-two years, as
                     well as varieties bearing the different mint marks. There were twenty or thirty mints at that time in operation in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. This would load up our Canadian collections with over a hundred varieties of this truly exotic
                        coin.<ref target="#CH2-n33">33</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He did not stop here, however, for at the end of his article <persName>McLachlan</persName> wrote: <q>Now, if we were to class every coin
                     that was made current in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> as Canadian by special ordonnance or proclamation,
                     the list would include with equal show of authority the whole coinage of Great Britain, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, Spain and Portugal issued during the latter part of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. Thus
                     the Spanish dollars, French crown pieces and <placeName>United States</placeName> half dollars, in silver, with the Portuguese joe in
                     gold, constituted the main currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> up to the year 1837...All these,
                     therefore could be classed as Canadian on the same grounds as the sou marque, and some of them even with greater show of authority...For
                     these reasons I have never considered the sou marque a Canadian coin, and I would advise collectors to class it only among the French
                     coins, where it really belongs.<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>McLachlan's</persName> criticism of <persName>Breton</persName> was both intemperate and ill founded, but it did
                  succinctly outline the fundamental question about French-Canadian coins that concerns us here. If every type and issue known to have
                  circulated in Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> is a legitimate French-Canadian colonial issue, then nearly
                  the entire coinage of England, <placeName>France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Austria</placeName>, and some <placeName>German</placeName>
                  and <placeName>Italian</placeName> states struck before 1763 would have to be included.</p>
               <p>A similar situation would exist for collectors of colonial American coins save for an important distinction between the numismatic histories
                  of the two countries. Some parts of colonial <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> created their own native coinages
                  before 1776. The British crown authorized and struck a copper coinage for one colony, Virginia. Between 1785 and 1792 several of the
                  independent American states <pb n="8"/> coined their own coppers (popularly, but incorrectly, classed as "colonials" only because they were
                  struck before the act of April 2, 1792 that established a national mint). Citizens of the <placeName>United States</placeName> have a
                  fairly rich native coinage history before our independence from colonial status. Had we been as barren of home-grown coinages as French <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> was, perhaps we would have tried to fill the vacuum with coins of the European
                  states and those of our masters, the British.</p>
               <p>Closer to our own time, Walter Breen's "Some Neglected Colonials" began his work on the date and mint combinations known for the sols and
                  demi-sols of 1738-64 and the earlier mousquetaires of 1709-13.<ref target="#CH2-n35">35</ref> Breen began his survey by stating "Collectors'
                  attention should be called to several classes of coins really belonging with the American Colonial series but ordinarily not collected with
                     them."<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref>
                  <placeName>Robert Vlack's</placeName> six part series "The French Colonies Sous of 1767" illustrated and described 16 obverse and seven
                  reverse dies used on this generic colonial issue.<ref target="#CH2-n37">37</ref> Vlack was careful nowhere to claim these coins as struck
                  specifically for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> and, of course, they have no bearing on French-<placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. They have, nevertheless, found their way into successive editions of the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Breen's essay "<placeName>North American</placeName> Colonial Coinages Under the <persName>French Regimo</persName> (1640-1763),"
                  marked the beginnings of a new phase of inflation for French-Canadian coins.<ref target="#CH2-n38">38</ref> This wide-ranging type catalogue
                  included 28 different issues (compared to <persName>Breton's</persName> mere nine) as French colonial coins and illustrated all of them.
                  Breen wrote that his catalogue listed "...all the coins authorized to pass current in Colonial <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> under the Bourbons, including some heretofore apparently unrecognized."<ref target="#CH2-n39">39</ref> Included were the by
                  now familiar <persName>Breton</persName> 501-9, much earlier billon issues counterstamped with a fleur-de-lys, the douzains and
                  demi-douzains of 1658 (on the strength of <persName>Adam Shortt</persName>'s attribution of these as the "old sols marqu�s"), various
                  1720 dated French coins he attributed to <persName>John Law</persName>, gold and silver coins recovered from the wreck of <hi rend="italic">Le Chameau</hi> (foundered 1725), and the sous of 1767. Conspicuously absent were any of the other coins "...authorized to
                  pass current..." in French American colonies, such as British, Spanish, Portuguese, or Dutch issues.</p>
               <p>By 1988, when he published his <hi rend="italic">Complete Encyclopedia of U.S. and Colonial Coins</hi>, Breen had recognized that his earlier
                  treatment of French colonial coins required some new, justifying structure.<ref target="#CH2-n40">40</ref> He proposed six classes of coins
                  that circulated in French <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName>: 1) Coins officially made for the French colonies in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>; 2)
                  Ordinance of 1683 Countermarks; 3) Domestic coins <pb n="9"/> officially exported to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>; 4) Domestic coins unofficially imported by merchants; 5) International trade coins unofficially imported by merchants; and
                  6) Lightweight British and Irish halfpence and tokens. Of these, <persName>Breen</persName> declared that only classes 1-3 were germane
                  to his subject and discarded the others. He could find no surviving examples of his class 2 (Spanish cob eight reales countermarked with a
                  fleur-de-lys) and was left with only classes 1 and 3 to discuss. Nevertheless, his encyclopedia represented something of an apotheosis as it
                  allocated no less than 441 different numbers to the coins he included as French colonial! In less than a century, the corpus of
                  French-Canadian coins grew from <persName>Zay's</persName> three, <persName>Leroux</persName>' 12 and <persName>Breton's</persName> nine, then to <persName>Breen</persName>'s 28, finally to an enormous 441 different issues that should be
                  included.</p>

               <p>The modern, popular American collectors' handbooks reflect some of this inflation. They also betray a general unease with the subject of
                  French-Canadian coins. The best edition of <hi rend="italic">The Standard Catalogue of <placeName>United States</placeName> Coins</hi>
                  (1957) listed as French Canadian the 1670 issues.<ref target="#CH2-n43">43</ref> The 1717 Perpignan coppers were confusingly listed under the
                  Canadian section but described as ordered for circulation "...in the American colonies (<placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName>)" by an edict promulgated at <placeName>Québec</placeName>. The 1721-22 nine deniers and 1767 sous (with and without
                  "RF" counterstamp) were listed under "French Colonies In General," following <persName>Zay's</persName> arrangement.<ref target="#CH2-n44">44</ref> The 1738 sols and demi-sols were not included. The <hi rend="italic">Coin World Comprehensive Catalog &amp;
                     Encyclopedia of <placeName>United States</placeName> Coins</hi> (1990) listed the 1670 silver issues but not the copper double, and
                  classed the 1717 Perpignan and 1721-22 coppers as "Issues Intended for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName>."<ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref> It dismissed the 1767 sous as having "...no rightful place in the American series..." The most popular handbook,

                  by stating "none of the coins of the French regime is strictly American."<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref> With this proviso in mind, the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book</hi>
                  <pb n="10"/> then listed the silver issues of 1670 (but not the copper double), the Perpignan coppers of 1717, and included the mousquetaires
                  of 1709-13 and the sols and demi-sols of 1738-64 (called there half soumarques and soumarques), confusingly followed by the nine deniers of
                  1721-22. Under a different heading, "French Colonies in General" were placed the 1767 sous (both varieties).</p>
               <p>The most popular guide for collectors of Canadian coins, <hi rend="italic">The Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins</hi>, is much
                  more generous in what it includes as French-Canadian.<ref target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> Under its section "Coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>" are to be found 28 different types and denominations and the debt owed to <persName>Breen</persName>'s 1976 ANS study is obvious. There were some surprising additions in the Charlton guide, such as the copper deniers and
                  doubles of <persName>Louis XIII</persName> and <persName>XIV</persName> and the liards of <persName>Louis XIV and
                  XV</persName>, which had not been included by <persName>Breen</persName> in either of his catalogues. The 1670 silver issues were included,

               <p>On the assumption that the French should know more about their own coinage than anyone else, it is instructive to examine the best guide to

                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> and <persName>La Rochelle</persName> billon sols of 1738-64 that bear a

                  and the 1767 sous with and without the "RF" counterstamp.<ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> The 1738-64 sols and demi-sols without the crowned

                  <hi rend="bold">Influences upon the Inflation of French-Canadian Types</hi>
               </head>
               <p>There are three explanations for the gradual inflation of the types and issues assigned a French-Canadian status. The first, and earliest, can
                  be ascribed to simple national chauvinism: lacking a homegrown colonial series, Canadian numismatists naturally looked to the motherland for
                  issues that might be classed as French colonial. Both <persName>Leroux</persName> and <persName>Breton</persName> published at a
                  time when the serious study of Canadian numismatics was in its early days. Their work with Canadian coins continued in the spirit of free
                  intellectual enquiry <pb n="11"/> begun by the founders of the Institut Canadien in 1844.</p>
               <p>The second was the publication of <persName>Adam Shortt</persName>'s magisterial <hi rend="italic">Documents Relating to Canadian
                     Currency, Exchange and Finance During the French Period</hi>.<ref target="#CH2-n50">50</ref> Shortt's archival study was intended to
                  illuminate the economic life of La Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> by the publication of documents that
                  were not generally available to historians. One of the classes of documentation he printed were the colonial registrations of royal decrees
                  and arr�ts that authorized the circulation of French homeland coins in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. Another,
                  related class was the colonial governors' acts rating the exchange values of these French coins for Canadian circulation. Taken together,
                  these two classes of documents exposed to numismatists a host of French metropolitan and European coin types that were officially authorized
                  to circulate in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. Given the cosmopolitan nature of coinage circulation during the
                  French colonialization period, the types authorized included virtually everything minted from the beginning of the seventeenth century onward,
                  ranging from Lion daalders of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2750405">Netherlands</placeName> to <placeName>Spanish</placeName>
                  silver and <placeName>Portuguese</placeName> gold. Most frequently mentioned in the ordinances were, naturally enough, French metropolitan
                  coins.</p>
               <p>Shortt had not intended his study to be a numismatic one, but the evidence he published was later taken up by the handful of collectors and
                  numismatic writers astute enough to recognize its significance for their field. Where Shortt found a document authorizing a particular coinage
                  to circulate in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, collectors found one that proved that coinage to have been
                  intended for Canadian circulation from the start. No one bothered to study how the coins mentioned had entered Canadian circulation, whether
                  officially or in the cargos of private speculators.<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> The connection was historically illogical but both
                  understandable and alluring. The documents Shortt published supplied the evidence for the majority of the obscure French issues <persName>Breen</persName> included in his 1976 ANS study and 1988 catalogue, for example.</p>
               <p>The third, and more recent, major influence on the inflation of French types attributed as French-Canadian largely owes its origins to
                  artifact reports from controlled archaeological excavations of French-Canadian sites. Following the Second World War, particularly after 1980,
                  many French trading posts and forts, as well as parts of the important settlement sites in <placeName>Québec</placeName> City and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, were systematically excavated and the finds reported in the scholarly press. In a
                  few cases the find reports were devoted specifically to the coins uncovered. <persName>Donald P. Heldmann's</persName> "Coins at <persName>Michilimackinac"</persName> is the best known of this type.<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> Usually, <pb n="12"/> however, reports
                  of coin finds were incorporated into the body of the general excavation paper and were used as an aid in dating the habitation phase of the
                     site.<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> In a few instances coins found were not recognized as such, because no trained numismatist was either
                  present during the excavation or examined the finds subsequently. A classic example is the find of two douzains of the 1590s, both bearing the
                  1640 recoinage fleur-de-lys counterstamp, excavated at a Jesuit mission site established by <persName>Fr. Jacques Marquette</persName> in
                     <placeName>Michigan</placeName>'s Upper Peninsula. These coins, believed deposited between 1671-92, when the mission was burned and
                  abandoned, were first reported as "copper kettle scraps," the identification later being corrected after the coins were properly
                     attributed.<ref target="#CH2-n54">54</ref> In other cases, coins found were partially identified but their numismatic significance missed
                  because the archaeological staff did not include a numismatist trained to their nuances. An example is the report of the coin finds at
                  Champlain's settlement at <placeName>Québec</placeName>, the Place Royale, which failed to understand the numismatic purpose (or date) of
                  the fleur-de-lys counterstamps found on several billon douzains excavated there.<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The best single study of the coins found in controlled archaeological excavations in French <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and French sites below the border is <persName>Peter N. Moogk's</persName> "When Money Talks: Coinage in New <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>."<ref target="#CH2-n56">56</ref>
                  <persName>Moogk</persName> reviewed the major excavation reports and personally inspected many of the coins found, in some cases
                  accurately attributing pieces previously misunderstood. He listed those French coin types dated before 1760 that had been uncovered from
                  archaeological digs. He showed that the copper coins found were composed primarily (299 of 323 found) of liards of Henry IV to <persName>Louis XIII</persName>. The billon coins were made up primarily of douzains of the sixteenth-seventeenth c., sols of 15 deniers of
                  1692-1713, sols of the 1738 series, and a few mousquetaires of 1709-13 and demi-sols of the 1739 series, with the second and third types
                  predominating. Only a handful of silver coins had been recovered, mostly 1/2 and 1 ecus. <persName>Moogk</persName> found one type, the
                  bronze 6 deniers of 1710-12 called the "Dardennes," as plentiful as the number of billon double sols of the 1738 series. The "Dardennes" were
                  not recognized by <persName>Breen</persName> or the Charlton Guide. <persName>Moogk</persName>'s study provides a useful cross
                  section of the coinage types that are known to have actively circulated in La Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. For the collector interested in them, <persName>Moogk</persName>'s article is the best place to start learning about
                  them.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>William T. Anton, Jr.</persName> recorded five New Jersey coppers dated 1786-87 that were struck over French types and
                  concluded that "sol denomination coppers must have circulated to a good extent in New <pb n="13"/> Jersey."<ref target="#CH2-n57">57</ref> He
                  recorded the undertypes as 1723-Q, 1774 (mintmark illegible), type of 1766-73, type of 1768-74 struck at Lille, and one unattributable sol.
                  These undertypes undoubtedly circulated in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Undersea wrecks have been a fruitful source of new coin types claimed as French Canadian. During the night of August 25-26, 1725, the French
                  48 gun transport, <persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Le Chameau</hi>
                  </persName>, foundered on the rocks of <persName>Kelpy Cove</persName>, off <placeName>Port Nova Island</placeName>, just 12 miles from
                  her destination of Fortress <placeName>Louisbourg</placeName>. She went down taking all hands and passengers, including the newly appointed
                  Governor of Trois Rivi�res and Intendant Begon's successor, <persName>Guillaume de Chazel</persName>. Salvage operations commenced from
                     <placeName>Louisbourg</placeName> late the next year, but the gold and silver treasure she carried was not recovered until 1965. After a
                  division of the recovered treasure a large part was sold by <persName>Parke Bernet Galleries</persName> in December, 1971.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Le Chameau</hi>
                  </persName> carried more than 82,000 Lt (livres tournois) of gold and silver coins meant to supply the colonial governors with funds to pay
                  administrative and military expenses. No complete inventory listing of all the coins recovered from the wreck has been published. The most
                  accessible one remains the auction catalogue entries, which are useful for the gold but unsatisfactory for the silver coins. The ill-fated
                  vessel carried gold <persName>Louis</persName> d'ors mirlitons dated 1723 to 1725, including both reverse varieties (long or short
                  fronds), struck at some 24 different mints. In some cases, the coins salvaged represent the majority of the survivors of their particular
                  mintages. The silver �cus aux huit L appear to be dated 1724 and 1725, the majority being from the seaboard mints of <persName>Bordeaux</persName> and <persName>La Rochelle</persName>. A handful of older sixi�mes was also recovered.</p>
               <p>The <persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Chameau</hi>
                  </persName> treasure represented the most valuable find of coins discovered in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and
                  naturally attracted public attention. The gold and silver coins found in the wreck, although struck to French metropolitan types, were clearly
                  destined for Canadian circulation. The fact that some coins found constituted the majority of their surviving populations suggested to some
                  collectors that the entire mintage of these must have been allocated to <placeName>Canada's</placeName> coinage needs. This quickly led to
                  numismatists claiming those issues as specifically French-Canadian. By the time <persName>Breen</persName> came to write his study for
                  the 1976 ANS bicentennial publication, all issues found in the wreck of <persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Le Chameau</hi>
                  </persName> had become French Canadian.<ref target="#CH2-n58">58</ref> This blanket acceptance was later qualified, but only respecting the silver
                     ecus.<ref target="#CH2-n59">59</ref> Today, any coin traceable to <persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Le Chameau</hi>
                  </persName> is claimed as French-Canadian; some of the same issues that lack the characteristic signs of immersion in cold salt water typical of
                  her cargo have also been sold as French-Canadian.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Are there any coins that are really French-Canadian? What types can a collector include with confidence? Finding an answer is not as easy as
                  posing the question. Even for British-American colonial coins the answer has been at times elusive, as a cursory glance through any current
                  edition of the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book</hi> will reveal. There, British merchants' tokens of the late eighteenth century are included
                  solely because their types refer to American personalities or places (the Franklin Press, Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, Washington Grate, or Pitt tokens, as examples). For French speaking <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> the answer is even more difficult to find. <persName>McLachlan</persName>
                  pointed out that the first coin specifically to mention <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> in its legends was the
                  1794 Copper Company of Upper Canada token.<ref target="#CH2-n60">60</ref> No other coin prior to that date bears the words "<placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>" or "Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>" in its legends. The
                  copper double of the 1670 issue is the only French colonial coin that bears the word "<placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>" as part of its legend.</p>
               <p>To answer these questions we have to decide what we mean by "French-Canadian" coins. There are several possible definitions, and by examining
                  these we may find our answer. The following catalogue listing is strictly reductionist in its philosophy. A mass of coins has accreted upon
                  Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> like coral on shipwrecked ecus. This catalogue makes no claim to being
                  complete in what should be included. There is much more work to be done before numismatists can be satisfied that all coins ordered for,
                  shipped to, or circulating in French <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> have been rescued from historical obscurity.
                  Rather, it should be seen as a modern first step toward that goal and as a continuation of <persName>McLachlan's</persName> deflationary
                  influence upon the corpus of French-Canadian numismatics.</p>

                  <p>Under this definition, none qualify as French-Canadian. No French coin, in its types or letters of authorization, was ever struck only for

                     should not surprise anyone. In nearly two cen- <pb n="15"/> turies of British rule the crown struck only one type for circulation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName>, the 1773 Virginia halfpenny, and that in a base metal and after 60 years

This definition includes French coins specifically coined for circulation in Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, as well as other named colonies. These are the issues that have been attributed to French <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> from the earliest days of Canadian numismatic study. The royal decrees
                     authorizing their issue were published by <persName>Zay</persName> and Shortt and their intended circulation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> is specifically stated. They include the 1670 silver 5 and 15 sols, the "<persName>Gloriam Regni</persName>" issue, and the copper double de l'Am�rique fran�oise of the same date. These issues were struck just five years
                     after the <persName>Carignan-Sali�res</persName> Regiment was dispatched to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and appear to have been part of an attempt by Colbert to put <placeName>Canada's</placeName> security and local
                     economy on a firmer footing than before. It is probable that the billon sols dated 1692-97 bearing an oval fleur-de-lys counterstamp
                     (Gadoury-92a, b) were so marked specifically for <placeName>North American</placeName> circulation. The earlier douzains with a similar
                     counterstamp (Gadoury-21), authorized by <persName>Louis XIII</persName> in 1640, are another probable candidate for this category.
                     These two types are, almost certainly, the sols marquez referred to in <placeName>Quebec</placeName> ordinances dated prior to 1710,
                     such as that of March 20, 1662, raising the ratings of French coins in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n63">63</ref> On the strength of this proposed attribution these two types are included in this category. It should be
                     remembered that these two represent some of the most commonly found coins in archaeological excavations of French trading and military
                     sites. The billon 30 deniers of 1710-13 struck at Lyons, the so-called Mousquetaires, were authorized by royal decree to circulate in
                     Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n64">64</ref> Also included are the 1717-Q copper 12
                     and 6 deniers colonies, and the 1721-B, 1721-H, 1722/1-H, and 1722-H copper sols of 9 deniers which replaced the 1717 coins.</p>

                  <p>This category includes those issues originally struck for metropolitan French circulation but which are known from documentary evidence to
                     have been shipped by the Minister of Marine to Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> for circulation there.
                     Future research will certainly expand the number of types listed here but the final number will, inevitably, remain small, since it was the
                     crown's intent to keep its colonies coinage poor. Included here are those particular gold and silver coins of 1723-25 which can be
                     absolutely pedigreed to the dispersal of the <persName>
                        <hi rend="italic">Le Chameau</hi>
                     </persName> treasure. The question of the copper 12 deniers coins of 1720 is, in my opinion, as yet unsettled. At the request of the Regency
                     Council, of which he was then the chief member, <persName>John Law</persName> directed the <persName>La Rochelle</persName> mint
                     to strike and ship to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> 40,000 Lt (livres tournois) of copper 12 deniers pieces.
                     De Beauharnois was advised of the intended shipment on March 12, 1720.<ref target="#CH2-n66">66</ref> These could only have been the sols
                     au buste enfantin (<persName>Gadoury</persName>-276), the only coppers of the reign rated at 12 deniers. However, although dies were
                     received at <placeName>La Rochelle</placeName> on April 8, 1720, no specimen from that mint appears to survive today dated 1720.<ref target="#CH2-n67">67</ref> This may be explained by the turmoil in French fiscal affairs that began in May and led, ultimately, to Law's
                     fall from grace in December 1720. It is likely that no sols of 12 deniers were actually struck at <placeName>La Rochelle</placeName> in
                     1720. It is equally likely that the 1721-22 issue of 9 deniers des colonies fran�oises, struck on Law's company's Swedish copper flans, was
                     coined in place of the 12 deniers pieces called for the year before. The sols of the 1738-64 mintage were shipped to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> in fairly large quantities. Documents of 1745 and 1752-53 specifically mention such shipments,
                     for example. The 9,000 Lt. known to have been shipped could have comprised virtually any date/mint combination struck from 1738-53. Unlike
                     the <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Chameau</persName>
                     </hi> find, no definite evidence exists showing which date/mint combinations were actually shipped. Going solely on the strength of the
                     written sources, it would be safe to include issues dated 1738-53 in a collection. Later dates are unsupported by the published sources;
                     unpublished archival materials may lengthen the terminus, however. Other contemporary documents mention requests for and shipments of sols
                     of 18 and 27 deniers and speak of "sols marquez," "sols neufs," and "sols vieux."<ref target="#CH2-n68">68</ref> The dates of these

                     document indicates that any were sent at that time. On October 30, 1752, a further 6,000 Lt. were requested; these were shipped by June 30
                     of the following year. This latter quantity represents 120,000 pieces and may have mostly been made up from the 114,620 struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1753.<ref target="#CH2-n69">69</ref> From 1738 through 1744 the issue was struck
                     at virtually every French mint then open. After 1744 through 1749 only eight mints continued the coinage. The number of mints actively
                     coining the issue dropped to seven in 1750, five in 1751-52, and from 1753 through 1761 only <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> and Strasbourg coined the type.

                     Published French estimates (principally <persName>Gadoury</persName>'s) often underestimate valuations. There is no reliable published

                  </head>
                  <p>Archaeological finds from controlled excavations, as opposed to casual finds out of stratigraphic context, are evidence for the types of
                     coins that actually circulated in <placeName>French</placeName>
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. Archaeological finds offer circumstantial, not historical, evidence of
                     authorization. At the very least, however, excavation finds show what types of coins were actually in circulation. They are not, however,
                     evidence that those coin types were officially authorized for or shipped to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.
                     Much pocket change came over with the colonists, themselves. In addition, even more billon coinage was shipped to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> by <placeName>French</placeName> merchants, who capitalized on the difference between its
                     higher metropolitan ratings. This said, this category is as much a catch-all as the next two. Of necessity, since archaeological
                     excavations are continuing in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and those parts of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> occupied by <placeName>French</placeName> military or trading outfits, the number of coin types to be included here
                     will undoubtedly grow. Further, there will be considerable cross-over of listings between this category and the second and third, above.
                     Here will be found the 15 deniers mousquetaires of 1709-13 struck at Metz and the demi- <pb n="24"/> sols (half sou marques) of 1739-48.
                     The Dardennes of 1710-12 should be better recognized than they are today as coppers that actively circulated in <placeName>French</placeName> speaking <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. Indeed, based upon quantities found in
                     archaeological contexts, they have a better place here than the 15 deniers of 1709-13 and the demi-sols of 1739-48! Recent excavations in
                     the center of <placeName>French</placeName> Mobile, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4829764">Alabama</placeName>, have yielded
                     specimens of <placeName>French</placeName> coppers dated 1721 and 1722. A single 1717 dated copper was discovered in a spoil heap by
                     metal detector!<ref target="#CH2-n70">70</ref> Additionally, the gold and silver coins from the <hi rend="italic">

                  <p>This is the largest category of all. All <placeName>French</placeName> coins that had currency in the homeland were, in law, given
                     currency in all <placeName>French</placeName> overseas colonies. In a conciliar decree of November 18, 1672, <persName>Louis</persName> XIV ordered "...that the money bearing the said device [the <persName>Gloriam Regni</persName> issue of 1670] and all
                     other coin current in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> shall circulate in the <placeName>French</placeName>
                     <placeName>Island</placeName>s and the Continent of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> under the dominion of
                     His Majesty..."<ref target="#CH2-n71">71</ref> The values of the <placeName>French</placeName> coinage were, however, to be
                     "...augmented in order that it may remain there..."<ref target="#CH2-n72">72</ref> As Shortt pointed out, this decree had validity
                     primarily in the West Indies, but its principle also applied to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. The
                     qualification that the ratings of <placeName>French</placeName> coins were to be augmented meant that each coinage issue was subject to
                     conciliar review and validation for overseas circulation. Thus, although the decree effectively authorized all <placeName>French</placeName> coins to be current in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, the collector cannot simply assume
                     that any he is offered could have been part of the French-Canadian coinage pool. Rather, he must also find royal documentary evidence that
                     shows the coinage in question to have been specifically rated for Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, and
                     ideally, <placeName>Quebec</placeName> or <placeName>Louisbourg</placeName> documentation acknowledging and publishing the royal
                     order. In the absence of written evidence there can be no certainty that a particular coinage was officially rated for circulation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Specific references to <placeName>French</placeName> coin types and issue dates are rare. An exception was the ordinance of March 20,
                     1662, issued at <placeName>Quebec</placeName> that specified a tariff of the new circulation values of various coins, including <placeName>French</placeName> royal gold and silver coins and their fractions.<ref target="#CH2-n73">73</ref> Another important exception
                     is the demi-sol of 1739-48, the half sou marqu�, which was rated by royal ordinances at 12 deniers for <pb n="25"/>
                     <placeName>Louisbourg</placeName> June 20, 1743, March 30, 1744, for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. These
                     were called "nouveaux demi-sols" in the 1738 edict that authorized their striking. They are generally much scarcer than the larger, sol
                     denomination pieces. The most collectable date is 1740; 1739, 1746, and 1748 issues are scarce; 1741-42 are very rare; none appear to
                     survive dated 1743-45 or 1747. No specific references to official shipments of these to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> have been published.</p>
                  <p>A final, notable exception is the September 2, 1726 minute of the inspection of the Treasury at <placeName>Quebec</placeName>. Conducted
                     following the con-ciliar revaluation of the coinage dated May 26 of that year, the inspectors found 500 �cus dated 1725 (the �cu aux 8 L,

                  <hi rend="bold">The Problem of the Mousquetaires and Sou Marques</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The mousquetaires of 30 deniers (so-called because it was essentially a military issue and the addorsed L's on the obverse reminded an
                  observer of a musketeer's moustaches) were not included in the French-Canadian corpus until after 1968. In that year, <persName>J.
                     Lafaurie</persName> printed the �dit of 1709 which originally authorized the issue, showing that the Metz coinage of the 30 deniers
                  denomination was given <pb n="26"/> currency in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>'s western border regions, primarily
                  to provide troops on campaign there with small change.<ref target="#CH2-n77">77</ref> Metz was the premier western frontier mint and was the
                  logical choice as the mint for this purpose. The Lyon coinage was given currency in the rest of mainland <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and the overseas colonies of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. The
                  smaller, 15 deniers denomination was struck only at Metz and was not intended for overseas circulation. The mousquetaires were not struck
                  specifically for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> or any <placeName>French</placeName> colony. In fact, in 1709
                     <placeName>Pontchartrain</placeName> wrote to <placeName>Quebec</placeName> denying the need or usefulness of a copper currency for
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and in 1711 a memorandum on the state of <placeName>Canada's</placeName>
                  finances noted that so little funding had been received from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> that additional
                  recourse was had to the card money expedient.<ref target="#CH2-n78">78</ref> The �dit authorizing their striking was not registered at <placeName>Quebec</placeName> but that they actively circulated in Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> was
                  demonstrated by <persName>Moogk</persName>'s survey of the archaeological evidence. Thus, of the three requirements for a coin to be a
                  legitimate <placeName>French</placeName> Canadian colonial issue (authorization for the colonies, official colonial rating, and evidence of
                  official shipment and circulation), the 30 deniers mousquetaires satisfy two.</p>
               <p>The "sou marques" (sols and demi-sols of 1738-64) were authorized by an edict of October 1738. The new billon issue was to achieve several
                  goals: to drive out foreign billon coins, which were to be demonetized in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>
                  thereafter; to offset reductions in value on the Dutch exchange of <placeName>French</placeName> billon coins of earlier issues (primarily
                  the 1710-13 mousquetaires); and to replace all earlier <placeName>French</placeName> billon issues, which thereafter were to be received at
                  all <placeName>French</placeName> mints on an intrinsic value basis only. The new billon issue was ordered current "...dans tout nôtre
                  Royaume, pays, terres, &amp; Seigneuries de nôtre ob�ïissance..." This has been read as giving the issue currency everywhere the Bourbon flag
                  flew, including Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. However, these words were really formulaic. The �dit of
                  May 1718 that authorized the gold <persName>Louis</persName> d'or à la croix de Malte (<persName>Gadoury</persName>-336) ordered
                  their circulation "...dans l'�ntendue de royaume, pays, terres, et seigneuries de l'ob�ïssance de Sa Majest�...," for example. The �dit of
                  September 1720, probably drafted by <persName>John Law</persName>, himself, authorized the coinage of the new silver de <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and gold 2 L series and allowed their circulation "...dans tout nôtre royaume, pays,
                  terres et seigneuries de nôtre ob�ïssance..." In both cases, the wording was, in its essentials, identical to that later found in the 1738
                  text and represented a general conveyance of currency for these issues throughout the kingdom. In this respect, the issues so authorized
                  became legal "French" coins with currency everywhere. We have already seen that an earlier edict gave currency to all <placeName>French</placeName> coins <pb n="27"/> throughout all <placeName>French</placeName> overseas possessions. The wording of the 1738 �dit, then,
                  on its face does not distinguish that issue from any other <placeName>French</placeName> coin and should not be read as conveying a special
                  "colonial" flavor to it. If it did, then all <placeName>French</placeName> coins authorized by a similar formula would also have to be
                  classed as "colonial." Not until 1743 and 1744 were the sols and demi-sols given official ratings for circulation in Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and <placeName>Louisbourg</placeName>. The original �dit that authorized a
                  metropolitan coinage gave it legal currency. For the colonies, a second act was required, rating it for overseas circulation, and probably was
                  issued only when the quantities in circulation of the mainland type had become noticeable enough to require action on the part of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. On the other hand, the royal �dits that authorized the special colonial issues of 1670
                  and 1717, for example, specifically limited their circulation to the overseas colonies of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> and forbade their importation and currency in mainland <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The coinage issues of 1720, popularly called "<persName>John Law</persName>'s coinage," have been a perennial source of confusion and
                  error for collectors and cataloguers of French-Canadian coins. Neither <persName>Zay</persName> nor <persName>Breton</persName>
                  included the 1720 coins, but <persName>Leroux</persName> did. Apparently on the strength of <persName>Leroux</persName>' catalogue
                     <persName>Breen</persName> wrote in his ANS study "...Law, as director of the mints, ordered certain coins to be shipped to the
                  colonies, consisting apparently of only the following" and then listed 10 different coinage issues he attributed to <persName>John
                     Law</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-n79">79</ref> In his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia</hi>, published 12 years later, <persName>Breen</persName> specifically listed as <persName>John Law</persName> issues only the copper demi-sol and sol au buste enfantin (<persName>Gadoury</persName>-273, 276). He mentioned in an introductory paragraph the 1720-A petit <persName>Louis</persName> d'argent
                     (<persName>Gadoury</persName>-305) as a <persName>John Law</persName> coin.<ref target="#CH2-n80">80</ref>
               </p>
               <p>From July 25, 1719 to January 5, 1721, Law's Compagnie des Indes enjoyed the premier b�n�fice des monnaies and operated the <placeName>French</placeName> mints for their own profit. Coin types specifically authorized by the crown during this period, and others for which
                  deliveries of dies to local mints fall within these dates, may be considered to be "<persName>John Law</persName>" coins. Modern American
                  collectors tend to assume that a coin type struck during Law's control of the mints is automatically a "colonial coin," because of the
                  association between Law and his Mississippi Scheme. For example, the <persName>Garrett</persName> Collection sale included specimens of
                  the 1720-A demi-sol au buste enfantin (Lot 1298, <persName>Gadoury</persName>-273), the 1720-A livre d'argent fin (Lot 1299, <persName>Gadoury</persName>-296), and the 1720-B petit <persName>Louis</persName> d'argent (Lot 1300, <pb n="28"/>
                  <persName>Gadoury</persName>-305) as <placeName>French</placeName> colonial coins. The "colonial" association is misleading, however.
                  Law, in common with his generation, looked upon the <placeName>French</placeName> overseas colonies as sources of natural products to be
                  purchased at home on credit, payable in finished goods exported to the colony. His attitudes toward hard currency in the colonies, as well as
                  at home, became negative in the extreme and from the beginning his scheme may have been aimed at withdrawing specie currency from circulation
                     entirely.<ref target="#CH2-n81">81</ref> The coinages struck during his control of the mints, until the recoinage of September, 1720, were
                  grudgingly approved and not altogether successful. None was struck for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. The
                  Council's order directing the <placeName>La Rochelle</placeName> mint to strike copper 12 deniers pieces in 1720 is the only exception to
                  Law's disinterest in coinage for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and the other overseas colonies, and, as we have
                  seen, even this issue was not actually struck.</p>
               <p>The question of which coins may properly be considered "<persName>John Law</persName>" coins has been discussed in my "The Compagnie des
                  Indes and the Premiere B�n�fice des Monnaies: <placeName>French</placeName> Coinage and the Mississippi Scheme, 1719-1720."<ref target="#CH2-n82">82</ref> There appear to be three copper, 10 silver, and three gold types attributable to the period of Law's control of
                  the <placeName>French</placeName> mints. It should be reemphasized that "the coin types included...are the company's, but they are not
                  necessarily colonial...All of the coins listed...had currency value in the <placeName>French</placeName> colonies and any colonist lucky
                  enough to have had these when he landed would have been in an enviable position compared to the coin-poor residents of his new home."<ref target="#CH2-n83">83</ref>

               </head>
               <p>The review of the historiography of French-Canadian numismatics has shown that there has been a gradual tendency to include more and more
                     <placeName>French</placeName> coin types in the corpus of those considered to be French-Canadian colonial ones. Some, few voices were
                  raised against this trend, but over the years they have been drowned by collectors' enthusiasm for finding new types to add to their holdings.
                  If we review the types commonly thought to be French-Canadian we find that many must be reconsidered. No <placeName>French</placeName>
                  issue was struck exclusively for Canadian circulation. However, there are many that were coined specifically for circulation in Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, as well as other colonies, and others that were authorized to pass current in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. Some others, mainland types, were officially exported to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, to pay military expenses or in answer to pressing needs for small change. Most foreign and all
                     <placeName>French</placeName> coins had currency in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> at one time or another.
                  The so-called "<persName>John Law</persName>" coins <pb n="29"/> may have passed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> but were not officially struck for or exported to Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. In
                  general terms, Nouvelle <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> appears to have been adequately supplied with minor copper
                  or billon coins for small daily transactions, but deliberately kept undersupplied with silver and gold coins.</p>

                  <p>The Numismatic Society of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> was founded in December 1862, just short of five
                     years after the founding of the ANS. See <persName>Alfred Sandham</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Coins, Tokens and Medals of the

                     "marqu�s" either, and was reduced to arguing that this name came from the way in which they were struck. (See below, n. 63). The use of the
                     term "sol marqu�" predated the 1738 billon issue. When <persName>Vaudreuil</persName> and <persName>B�gon</persName> wrote to the
                     Count de Maurepas on November 2, 1724, regarding the habitants' resistance to the copper nine deniers of 1721-22, they stated that the new
                     coinage "...is not necessary as the smallest purchase is never below a sol marqu�." Shortt, pp. 536-537. In 1752 the sols were called
                     "marqu�s" however. Confusion of terminology reigned then, as now. The �dit that authorized them in 1738 called them sols and demi-sols, not
                     sols and double sols or sou marqu�s. I have used the original, enabling act's terms.</p>

                  <p>Examples of sols or double sols of the 1738 type counterstamped with a crowned "C" as called for in the 1763 �dit, appear to be extremely
                     rare. <persName>Zay</persName> illustrated one in the line drawing on p. 65 of his work; <persName>Gadoury</persName> and <persName>Cousini�</persName> reproduce a photograph of a specimen on p. 17 of theirs. <persName>McLachlan</persName> could be
                     dogmatic and intolerant in his opinions. He could also be very wrong. In the case of the 1738 sols and demi-sols, archaeological finds and
                     documentary evidence show that not only did some circulate in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, but also that
                     several hundred thousand pieces of the larger denomination were officially shipped to <placeName>Quebec</placeName> by the Treasurer of

                  <p>"The events at <placeName>Quebec</placeName> in 1662-64 reveal the willingness [of] French merchants to take advantage of the different
                     valuation given to French coins in the colony. When the coins were discounted in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, they were quickly shipped to the colonies to benefit from the higher values there. This was contrary to the wishes of the
                     government, which [later] decreed in 1699 that ships should not carry more French currency than was needed to pay for the vessel's
                     operating expenses;" and "royal officials at <placeName>Quebec</placeName> and <persName>Louisbourg</persName> complained [on June
                     27, 1743] about the merchants and 'pacotilleurs' [trinket pedlars] who brought out the sols marqu�s and the consequent proliferation of the
                     small coins. Traders paid them out at the colonial value, but refused to accept the same coins in payment." <persName>Peter N.

On the contrary, I date three of the five <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> parasites to 1789-90, the height of the overstriking period in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> series, and suggest that the sols were parts of batches of various, worn hosts meant for
                     recoinage to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> types. The weights of host coins were unimportant to the
                     NJ coiners, I know of many "overweight" ones. These worn host coins were essentially valueless at the time as they had been discredited in
                     the marketplace. Their NJ overtypes gave them currency, not their weights. Had sols been as plentiful as <persName>Anton</persName>
                     states we would expect to find more of them overstruck by NJ types. Instead, they are extremely rare.</p>

                  <p>Shortt (above, n. 11), pp. 4-7, 15 n. 2. <persName>Breen</persName>, believed the ordinance's "sols marquez" referred to the douzains
                     and demi-douzains of 1658, and included them in his ANS study as nos. 2, 3 (<persName>Breen</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Studies</hi>
                     [above, n. 38]. In this, he borrowed from Shortt, who had earlier argued that the 1658 issues had been struck on new minting <pb n="34"/>
                     equipment and that the word "marquez" referred to this fact. If Shortt meant the introduction of screw presses at the Louvre, however, he
                     was late by nearly 100 years. It is my belief that <placeName>Quebec</placeName> or <placeName>Louisbourg</placeName> references to
                     "sols marquez" before 1710 should be understood as meaning the counterstamped billon coins of the 1640 and 1692 recoinages. A royal
                     ordinance of June 20, 1743, for <placeName>Louisbourg</placeName> (enacted for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> on March 30, 1744), distinguished the "anciens sols" and the "nouveaux sols" of 1738, the former to be current in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> at 18 deniers, the latter at 24, Shortt, pp. 718-19. An ordinance of Beauhamois and
                     Hocquart dated January 30, 1744, reduced the "vieux sols marqu�s" to 18 deniers, the rating ordered by the king for the "anciens sols" the
                     year previous, Shortt, pp. 726-27. This was the ordinance referred to by <persName>Zay</persName> in his note describing the 1738
                     billon sols and double sols. <persName>Zay</persName> incorrectly attributed the 18 deniers rating to the sols of 1738, whereas the
                     ordinance of 1743 actually rated the 1738 issue at 24 deniers. <persName>Zay's</persName> misattribution, together with later Canadian
                     references to sols of the 1738 mintage as "marqu�s," have obscured the real identity of the "sols marqu�s" in circulation before 1710. It
                     is likely that in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> before 1710 the term "vieux sols marqu�s" referred to the
                     billon pieces with fleur-de-lys counterstamps. Another ordinance of Beauharnois and Hocquart at <placeName>Quebec</placeName> on October
                     5, 1743, restricted the tender of "anciens sols marqu�s" to one-fortieth the total of any payment, noting that these had been demonetized
                     in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> by conciliar decree on August 1, 1738, three months prior to the �dit that
                     authorized the new billon issue.</p>

               <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName> &amp; Company, the coining and machinery firm founded by <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> of
               Soho near Birmingham, prepared coins, tokens, dies and machinery for a variety of places around the world. Some of these were logical indeed,
               bearing numismatic testimony to the old adage that trade follows the flag. Thus, the British occupation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> first resulted in coinages for various parts of this enlarged sphere of influence, and eventually the
               provision of mints for the striking, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, of a colony-wide coinage on <persName>Boulton's</persName> model.</p>
            <p>In other cases, the paths of coinage and minting machinery take us by surprise: what, precisely, was <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName>
               doing in Russia? What did he <hi rend="italic">think</hi> he was doing when he actively solicited business from Britain's mortal foes, the
               Revolutionary French? This cheerful ability to pop up in unexpected places is one of the more interesting aspects of the <persName>Boulton</persName> operation, but it was not the most profitable. Taking the overall view, <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName>, his
               successors, and their firm had their most persistent, most lucrative dealings with those areas under British political and/or commercial control.
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> is a prime example, but the English possessions in the Caribbean are another. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> is a third, and it forms the subject of this article.</p>
            <p>The connections between the Birmingham firm and the British possession lasted, in an episodic way, for over half a century. To a degree, they
               functioned in the shadow of <persName>Soho's</persName> largest concerns and hopes vis-à-vis <placeName>Canada's</placeName> southern
               neighbor, and, indeed <persName>Soho's</persName> successes in the Canadian arena can only be fully understood with due regard to its
               failures in the American one.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> had long enjoyed an ambivalent relationship with the inhabitants of the former thirteen colonies. In
               the mid-1770s, he had spearheaded a remonstrance to Parliament, condemning American insurgency in highly intemperate language.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> By the following decade, his views toward Americans had mellowed, <persName>Boulton</persName> wishing them well
               in their new government experiment. In part this originated in a natural desire to increase the volume and types of business which his company
               had with the former colonists. But it also stemmed from an authentic progressivism, one which was doubtless reinforced by all the trouble and
               blind obstinance which <persName>Boulton</persName> was now encountering in his attempts to secure a regal coining contract from the British
               king and his minions.</p>
            <p>Domestic resistance to new ideas, along with several thousand pounds' worth of improved minting equipment which he could not profitably allow to
               stand idle, led <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> into a number of speculative contacts with the Americans. His primary contact in these
               early negotiations was <persName>John H. Mitchell</persName> of <placeName>Charleston, South <pb n="39"/> Carolina.</placeName>
               <persName>Boulton</persName> first discussed the possibilities of a state coinage with this young, prematurely-optimistic planter. After the
               creation of the new national government under the Constitution (which document prohibited state coinage), <persName>Boulton</persName> and
               the Charlestonian explored the prospects of securing the right to strike our new, national coinage. <persName>Boulton</persName> would fail
               in both attempts, in part because of the spirited opposition of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas
                  Jefferson</persName> to the national proposal.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> But an American coinage would shine before <persName>Matthew
                  Boulton</persName> and his successor like a numismatic Holy Grail for the next two decades. Meanwhile, they would content themselves with lesser
               things. And here is where the contact with <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> originated.</p>
            <p>We have no archival testimony bearing on that first connection; there is only the evidence of the coins. Or rather tokens; from 1794 come
               extremely rare pieces struck on behalf of the Copper Company of Upper Canada. They are unquestionably <persName>Soho</persName> products,
               their obverse die created by <persName>No�l-Alexandre Ponthon</persName>, who worked for <persName>Boulton</persName> between 1791 and
               1795 <ref target="#fig-15">(fig. 1)</ref>.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>
               <persName>Ponthon</persName> may have gotten the idea for the composition from a previous <persName>Boulton</persName> piece, the 1791
                  <persName>Glasgow</persName> token for <persName>Gilbert Shearer</persName> &amp; Company, the product of an earlier, equally
               short-term engraver, <persName>Rambert Dumarest</persName>. The lettering surrounding the figure, sunk into a raised border, was a
               distinctive <persName>Boulton</persName> touch from the mid-1790s, which would soon find a more important expression, on <persName>Soho's</persName> regal copper issues of 1797.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The reverse of the Canadian pattern is problematic. <persName>Ponthon</persName> presumably created it as well, for its style is highly
               reminiscent of the reverses used for the Monneron tokens, pieces for which <persName>Ponthon</persName> was certainly responsible. But its
               very simplicity renders such an attribution uncertain; virtually any middling diesinker could have created it. It seems to me that this plainness
               of reverse design may be ascribed to one of two possibilities. <persName>Boulton</persName> may have counseled haste in filling a request
               for a pattern, assuming that the artistry of <persName>Ponthon's</persName> obverse would carry the project to success. Or he may <pb n="40"/> have viewed its prospects as unlikely, not worth the time of an elaborate effort for the reverse die. Of the two possibilities, the former
               strikes me as the more probable, for it corresponds to <persName>Boulton's</persName> business procedure in several other instances. But the
               contrast between obverse and reverse, however it originated, strikes us as jarring. <persName>Walter Breen</persName> suggests that the
               Copper Company of Upper Canada token was created on behalf of Governor Simcoe, whose recall in 1796 might explain why the pieces never got beyond
               pattern stage.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>There is a second, related piece worth mentioning, a mule created by combining the reverse of the Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> token with the obverse of a second <persName>Soho</persName> pattern for American consumption,
               a speculative halfpenny ordered by <persName>Philip Parry Price Myddelton</persName> for a new settlement in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254925">Kentucky</placeName>
               <ref target="#fig-16">(fig. 2)</ref>. The scheme never came to fruition, but a few tokens did get manufactured, harbingers of what would have
               been a large issue had irate Crown officials not prevented <persName>Myddelton</persName> and his flock from proceeding with their
                  plans.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref>

            <p>
               <persName>Soho</persName> tended to save dies, even those for unsuccessful coinages. After the demise of the firm, many of them were reused
               to create restrikes and mules by <persName>W. J. Taylor</persName>, a <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName>
               diesinker. Active between the 1860s and the 1890s, <persName>Taylor</persName> has made matters miserable for several generations of
               scholars and collectors of <persName>Boultoniana</persName>: many of his concoctions are readily identifiable, but others are not.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the case of the <persName>Myddelton</persName>/Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> mule, a restruck
               concoction by <persName>Taylor</persName> is definitely suggested. Photographs of the piece indicate rust spots, which is precisely what one
               encounters on other <persName>Taylor</persName> restrikes, pieces made decades after their purported date. Additionally, coins, tokens, and
               medals made at <persName>Soho</persName>, even those manufactured beyond their stated date, tend to have an internal consistency. Put
               another way, there are very few mules in the legitimate <persName>Soho</persName> series. This piece, with not one but two unrelated
               American references, strains credulity: the <persName>Soho</persName> coiners simply did not em- <pb n="41"/> brace that sort of practice.
               In my opinion, this hybrid is a later concoction, done outside the <persName>Soho</persName> Mint. But only a minute examination of the
               actual piece, its surfaces, and especially its edges (<persName>Taylor's</persName> edges are generally less precisely finished than <persName>Soho's</persName>) will tell for certain.</p>
            <p>There is a peculiarly episodic quality about <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName>'s Canadian connection. The next chapter in the story would
               take place in the early 1820s, a dozen years after <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName>'s death. Like the initial contact of the 1790s, this
               one was abortive, but with a crucial difference. For the first period, we have coinage without archival testimony. For the second, we have
               archival testimony without coinage.</p>
            <p>This second stage in <persName>Soho's</persName> dealings with <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> is represented
               by a single document in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName> Reference Library Collection. It is a reply to a
               letter of January 21, 1821, from <persName>W. Richardson</persName> of <placeName>Halifax, Nova Scotia</placeName>. <persName>Richardson</persName> had written to <persName>Boulton</persName> and Watt (the branch of the firm which built steam engines, which
               eventually forwarded the letter to the coining branch of the operation), apparently requesting information on the firm's prices for preparing one
               or more orders of commercial tokens for Canadian circulation. <persName>M. R. Boulton's</persName> reply sets down the general parameters of
               a business arrangement:<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref>
               <q>Not possessing the advantage of being personally known to you, I hope it will not be deemed improper on my part, previous to our entering upon
                  the subject of your letter, to beg the favor of a reference to some mercantile house of acknowledged respectability in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, who may be willing to take upon themselves the responsibility of answering my drafts for the
                  amount of all your orders... It will also be requisite for your correspondent in this country to furnish me with a license from the Privy
                  Council for Trade and Plantations, authorizing the export of these tokens, the making and shipping of which would otherwise be considered
                  illegal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The younger <persName>Boulton</persName> was being prudent here: the firm had been less cautious in several other initial contacts, and it
               had occasionally paid dearly for its naiv�t�. But its polite request for credentials may have cost it dearly in this instance as well: we hear no
               more of Mr. <persName>Richardson</persName> in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName> Archives. And if he had
               tokens struck, they were not elaborated at <persName>Soho</persName>.</p>
            <p>What might they have been? As far as I have been able to determine, there are no tokens of this period from <placeName>Nova
               Scotia</placeName>, or from any other Canadian province, made for a <persName>Mr. Richardson</persName>. It is con- <pb n="42"/> ceivable that he
               was involved in the semi-official <placeName>Nova Scotian</placeName> halfpence and pence of 1823-1824. But these coins were most definitely
               not <persName>Soho</persName> products, with a standard of workmanship far inferior to anything emanating from the <persName>Boulton</persName> mint. At present, nothing further can be said, and we are simply left with one more instance of an initial contact left
               unfulfilled.</p>
            <p>The next contact would come during the later 1830s, and it would generate concrete results. <persName>Soho</persName> would carry through,
               actively solicit Canadian minting business, and create an excellent token coinage which would add much credit to its name, much vitality to an
               aging coinage operation.</p>
            <p>Between the beginning of 1838 and the spring of 1845, <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName> designed and produced no less than 90 tons of penny
               and halfpenny tokens for four fiscal institutions in Lower <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, the City Bank, the <placeName>Quebec</placeName> Bank, and the <placeName>Banque du Peuple</placeName>. During these activities, the venerable firm showed a surprising degree of celerity and panache, characteristics
               which stood in obvious contrast to the stodgy ways in which it had tended to conduct its affairs in previous years. Only replying by letter to an
               initial request made in late January 1838, <persName>Soho</persName> actually had dies engraved, copper rolled and struck, and the first
               batch of penny tokens (for the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>) out the door within three weeks' time.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> And the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName> coiners were soon sending them to their
               British port of debarkation by a newfangled, time-saving invention called a <hi rend="italic">railroad.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>What had happened? Why should <persName>Soho</persName> have behaved with an activity worthy of the elder <persName>Boulton</persName>,
               when it had very recently displayed a cheerful indifference to timeliness, an absentmindedness which drove its clients to distraction?<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The answer may be that the firm had just lost a lucrative piece of business, its lackadaisical tradition having perhaps been a factor. The
               severed connection had been in place for over 40 years, and it had been with one of the elder <persName>Boulton's</persName> targets of
               keenest interest, the <placeName>United States</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. We need not go
               into details here, and in any case they are covered in an article I published in the <hi rend="italic">British Numismatic Journal.</hi> It must
               be admitted that there is no mention of habitual lateness in carrying out orders as a factor in the decision to end the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> Mint's links with <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName>, either in the Mint Papers at the National Archives or in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName> Reference Library. But <persName>Soho's</persName> tardiness in filling and
               sending orders had annoyed the Mint on numerous occasions, and one virtue of the new, American supplier was that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
               American, and hence somewhat more amenable of influence from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>.
                  <pb n="43"/> In any event, <persName>Matthew Robinson</persName>
               <persName>Boulton</persName> and the other, aging members of the <persName>Soho</persName> operation must have gone through extensive
               soul-searching once the surprising and irrevocable decision of the Mint became known, and a determined resolve to do better with any future
               coining contracts would have been a logical reaction. And history would repeat itself: the disappearance of a moneying possibility with the
               Americans would, once again, inspire increased attention to the land to the north.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Soho's</persName> tokens for Lower <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> bear dates of 1837, 1842, and
               1844. The dates are generally inaccurate as to the time of manufacture. While 1842-dated issues actually were made in the summer of the year
               whose date they bear, the 1837 tokens were struck on several occasions from the winter of 1838 through the summer of 1839, while tokens dated
               1844 were made well into 1845.<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> This was reasonably common procedure at <persName>Soho</persName>, as indeed
               it currently was or had been at many other mints, including our own. But confusion over the correct year to place on a die might explain the fact
               that there are also extremely rare halfpence dated 1845.</p>

            <p>These pence and halfpence featured two designs. The 1837 issues, for the four Lower <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>
               banks already mentioned, display a habitant or French-Canadian settler on their obverses. This figure was widely though incorrectly thought to be
                  <persName>Louis Joseph Papineau</persName>, leader of an abortive rebellion against British rule in 1837, the date given on the reverse.
               The primary design on that side of these penny and halfpenny tokens was rendition of the arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. The name of the actual issuing bank may be seen in minute incused lettering on the ribbon beneath the arms <ref target="#fig-17">(figs. 3</ref>-<ref target="#fig-18">4)</ref>. This reverse was <pb n="44"/> retained for the issues of 1842 and 1844, but a
               frontal view of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> was substituted for the habitant <ref target="#fig-19">(figs. 5</ref>-<ref target="#fig-20">6)</ref>. I have been unable to uncover the name of the designer or designers of these tokens, although
               they may have been the products of <persName>John Sheriff</persName>, who was employed at <persName>Soho</persName> on Mexican coinage
               at the time the Canadian order was first discussed.<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref>

            <p>A progression of sorts exists in the Canadian activities of <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName> &amp; Company in the 1830s and 1840s. That
               is, the firm's first <placeName>Quebec</placeName> coppers were created on behalf of several strictly private banking institution, while its
               second series had a quasi-official air about it. The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> had secured what
               amounted to a monopoly for the importation and circulation of copper tokens before placing its second batch of orders with the <persName>Soho</persName> coiners:<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> from now on, <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName> would be coining for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> in at least a semi-official capacity.</p>
            <p>For New Brunswick, a logical end to this progression was achieved: in this case, <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName> would be coining a
               purely official, colonial issue for a Canadian province.</p>
            <p>The New Brunswick penny and halfpenny tokens were created in record time by <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName>. On August 4, 1842, <persName>J. Tarratt</persName> &amp; Company, of Ann Street, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName>, made enquiries
               to <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName> concerning a possible coinage for the province of New Brunswick. A list of charges was sent to <persName>Tarratt</persName> &amp; Company the following day.<ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> For the next several months, neither side appears
               to have pursued the issue: for <persName>Soho</persName> the younger <persName>Boulton's</persName> death <pb n="45"/> in mid-1842
               would have complicated matters, as would have its current engagement with the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. But contact was resumed once the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> order had been finished:
               early in January 1843, a contract was drawn up between <persName>Tarratt</persName> &amp; Company and John Westley, on behalf of <persName>Boulton, Watt</persName>. Pence and halfpence were wanted, but speed was of the essence: a Captain <persName>Dudne</persName>
               was in Britain on business for the colony, and he hoped to return to <persName>St. John</persName>, with the tokens, at the end of February.
               The constraint of time in this particular instance (as well, I suspect, as a lingering memory of the loss of the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> trade), inspired <persName>Soho</persName> to a celerity and an artistic excellence, a sort of numismatic grace under
               pressure, which would have done credit to the firm at any time during its career, and which was truly extraordinary this close to its end. <persName>Soho's</persName> estimate of charges for the coinage went out on January 6. More copper was arranged for the following day (for the
               coinage would exhaust the slender resources remaining after the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> order had been
               filled). An engraving of a frigate had been procured by the tenth; a rendition of this vessel would adorn the reverses of the new coppers.</p>
            <p>Metal for the issue was being rolled by the sixteenth. Dies were to be ready by the twenty-second (in the event, <persName>Soho</persName>
               had to wait until the second of February for them, <persName>John Westley</persName> explaining to the impatient Captain Dudne "that artists
               in our business are most notorious for procrastination, much to our annoyance"; he added that the delay would be worthwhile, considering the
               quality of the resulting tokens). Actual striking was under way by the middle of February, and this, the most crucial part of the operation, had
               been completed by about the end of the month. On March 1, Westley wrote Captain <persName>Dudne</persName> proudly to inform him that "I
               hope to have the pleasure to transmit the New Brunswick coinage per railway on Saturday next, the 4th instant, being six days before the time you
               gave us." And on the day following, Westley passed a final judgement on the new money. In a letter to <persName>Thomas Jones
                  Wilkinson</persName>, he boldly said that "a more beautiful coinage was never before issued from our mint."<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>History supports this view. For all the speed with which it was executed, the New Brunswick coinage must certainly stand as one of <persName>Soho's</persName> loveliest creations. These are heavy pieces, the pence weighing 26 to the pound and the halfpence 52. The depiction
               of the frigate is rendered with the greatest attention to detail, while the head of the young Queen is charmingly presented <ref target="#fig-21">(figs. 7</ref>-<ref target="#fig-22">8)</ref>. These pieces are simply superb productions, and they invite comparison with the better-known
               Heaton issues of 1854.</p>

            <p>By that time, of course, <persName>Soho</persName> no longer existed, having gone out of business at mid-century; but since <persName>Ralph Heaton</persName> &amp; Sons had purchased the earlier firm's coining machinery, a direct line of descent exists between the
               issues of 1843 and those of 1854. Those machines, first developed by <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> and carefully tended by
               generations of <persName>Soho</persName> artisans, still had much work to do. And if a high degree of wear means anything, then the products
               they struck for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> enjoyed an eager and sustained acceptance among several generations
               of a growing nation. <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> could not have wished for a better, more lasting, Canadian legacy than this.</p>

                     <persName>Mitchell-Boulton</persName> Correspondence</hi> (privately printed, 1931). This correspondence largely occupies the years

                  Library (hereafter BRL), largely in Letter Box Ml (Ma-Mit). The negotiations in the direction of a possible national contract coinage came
                  during this same general period; parts of them may be found in the locations mentioned, the remainder in letters to <persName>Matthew

            <p>
               <persName>Sir Isaac Coffin, Bart</persName>., the individual responsible for ordering the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> token,
               also referred to as a <persName>Penny</persName>, was born in Boston on May 16, 1759. In 1773 he was appointed Midshipman in the British
               navy and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in only three years. He proved to be a capable young officer and continually rose through the
               ranks, eventually becoming an admiral in 1802 and a baronet in 1804.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>While still in the British navy, in 1786, he was appointed to the frigate <hi rend="italic">Thisbe</hi> and ordered to take <persName>Lord Dorchester</persName> and his family to <placeName>Quebec</placeName>. While on his way up the river to <placeName>Quebec</placeName>
               the <hi rend="italic">Thisbe</hi> was becalmed off the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>s, in the St. <placeName>Lawrence</placeName>
               River. <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> was struck by the islands and requested that <persName>Lord Dorchester</persName> bestow them on
               him. He was initially refused.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref>
               <persName>W.A.B. Douglas</persName> notes, however, that in 1787 <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> alerted the legislative council of
                  <placeName>Quebec</placeName> to American exploitation of the fisheries and illicit trade on the Iles de la Madeleine (The <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>s). A committee of the council favored <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> "proprietor" of the islands. The
               matter was not acted on until 1795 when he raised the issue again with the Treasury in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, and letters patent were issued to <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> on April 24, 1798, for the seigneury of the islands.
               According to the terms of the grant, he was obliged to allow free access to the beaches and shores of the fishery. <persName>W.A.B.
                  Douglas</persName> also notes that because of Coffin's professional abilities and reputed knowledge of the fisheries much "public utility" was
               expected from his proprietorship. As an absentee landlord acting through agents, however, he himself obtained nothing but aggravation.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</persName>, one of <placeName>Canada's</placeName> premier numismatists, first
               addressed the topic of the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> token in 1880. He noted that while <persName>Sandham</persName> in 1869
               gave a separate division to this coin, the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>s are attached to the Province of <placeName>Quebec</placeName>. At that time he believed that the penny was imported by some of the large fish dealers for change which was scarce on the
                  islands.<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1886, <persName corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</persName> again addressed this topic, and noted that <persName>Sir
                  Isaac</persName> visited his Canadian possession or kingdom only once and during this visit placed the token under consideration into circulation.
               He noted that the visit and the striking of the token was well described by the medallist <persName>Sir Edward Thomason</persName> in his
               "Memoirs during half a century" published in London in 1845 <persName>McLachlan</persName> quoted Sir <persName>Thomason's</persName>
               entire entry regarding the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> token which we deem worthy of repeating: <q>1815. I had manufactured this
                  year a large quantity of tokens for Admiral <persName>Sir Isaac Coffin, Bart</persName>., who is the sole possessor and king, as he calls
                  himself, of the <placeName>Magdalen <pb n="51"/> Island</placeName>s, situated in the Gulf of St. <placeName>Lawrence</placeName> in
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName>. They were principally of copper, pence and half-pence. The obverse was
                  a seal, and the legend around the edge, "<placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> Token, 1815" The reverse, a split codfish; the legend
                  "Success to the Fishery. One Penny."</q>
               <q>As soon as a large quantity of these were struck off, <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> sailed off with them, packed up in casks, and took
                  with him a powerful coining press and machinery, and dies ready engraved, to establish what he called a little mint for his subjects to
                  manufacture their coin for the future, on receiving the rolled copper from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, and
                  disposing of the scrap part to the Americans. All this I arranged for him, agreeably to his wishes.</q>
               <q>On <persName>Sir Isaac's</persName> return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, he informed me that the
                  inhabitants paid him every attention and courtesy and were much delighted with the new coin which <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> advanced
                  by way of loans to some of the superiors, at a fair interest, and for the expense that he had been at for their well-doing. They allowed him
                  to institute a kind of poll tax, a trifle for each to pay annually to the Committee of Management, but no sooner had he left the <placeName>Island</placeName>, but they broke faith and at the waters edge shouted out "Fouettez <persName>King George</persName> and
                     <persName>King Coffin</persName>!" I have reason to believe that the Admiral never again went to visit his subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>McLachlan</persName> noted that "No specimen of the 'half-pence' mentioned in this memorandum has ever come to light." He felt
               that <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, writing from memory, took it for granted that there was a coinage of half-pence. He did concede,
               however, that such dies were prepared as noted by <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, and that they were probably sent to the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>s with the coinage press.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref>
               <persName>McLachlan's</persName> conclusion regarding the half-pence has remained unchallenged to the present. But to our surprise, the
               landmark 1871 sale of the <persName>Dr. Charles Clay</persName> sale catalogued by <persName>William Harvey</persName> Strobridge,
               contains the following entry for lots 43 and 44: <q>43. <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>s. Pennies; Rev. dried fish. Two pieces. One
                  uncirculated.</q>
               <q>44. do. Half Pennies. Fine. Two pieces.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Contemporary numismatic reports of the sale in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Mason's</persName> Coin Collectors' Magazine</hi> are silent with respect to the lot in question. Perhaps the fact that lot 43
               only brought 20 cents while lot 44 only brought the <pb n="52"/> lofty sum of 40 cents, coupled with the fact that the lot is not plated,
               accounts for the numismatic press of the day failing to realize the potential importance of the two half-pence listed in the sale. More
               importantly, no subsequent writer has challenged the entry as an error. We note, however, that <persName>Ebenezer L. Mason</persName> in the
               January 1872 issue of <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Mason's</persName> Monthly Coin Collectors' Magazine</hi> commented about the extensive typographical and other errors found in
               the Clay sale;<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> unfortunately, he did not comment on the lot with the "two Half Pennies." Given the importance of
               that sale in its day, we are surprised that this lot went unreported. Nevertheless, in the absence of specific evidence to the contrary, and,
               despite <persName>Mason's</persName> criticism in general, the present writers are of the opinion that lot 44 of the Clay sale may represent
               examples of <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> Halfpennies, presumably from the aforementioned dies. Worthy of note is the fact that
               proofs of the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny were struck and, as we will develop, are far more common than uncirculated business
               strikes. Given the fact that proofs of the penny were struck, it seems unlikely that neither Sir Edward nor <persName>Sir Isaac</persName>
               obtained impressions from the Halfpenny dies. The two Halfpennies listed in the Clay sale may be such impressions. This, however, does not answer
               the question of why such a rarity existed only in circulated condition and why both of the specimens in question were identically described as in
               fine condition. If they exist, perhaps they were carried as pocket pieces.</p>
            <p>Returning to the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny, we note that it was first described by <persName>Thomas Sharp</persName>
               in his catalogue of the <persName>Sir George Chet-wynd</persName> collection published in 1834 in an edition of 60 copies. He accurately
               described the token noting that the edge was "engrailed-Halliday," referring to the fact that the dies were cut by Halliday. <persName>Thomas</persName> Halliday was one of the leading manufacturers of nineteenth century tokens, and was also a diesinker. He was known to have
               engraved many of <persName>Sir Edward's</persName> tokens including the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny. <persName>Thomas Sharp</persName> went on the describe two such tokens in <persName>Sir George'</persName>s collection; one noted as "fine bronzed
               impression," and the other noted as "another specimen - unbronzed." <persName>Sir George's</persName> collection was auctioned in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in 1872, by <persName>Christie, Manson and Woods</persName>. Lot 549 of that sale
               contained a grouping that included a <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny without any further description.</p>
            <p>Typical specimens of the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny weigh between 17 and 18 g. <persName>Warren Baker</persName>,
               however, in his catalogue No. 33, at lot 343, offered for sale a plain edge test piece struck without a collar on a very thick flan of 3 mm which
               weighed 23.93 g That specimen was in extra fine condition and was described by <persName>Mr. Baker</persName> as having a small scratch on
               the obverse seal. He also noted the ex- <pb n="53"/> istence of one other such specimen that was in about very fine condition.</p>
            <p>We believe that all specimens, both proof as well as the business strikes, were struck from the same single pair of dies. We note that the
               obverse of proofs and high grade business strikes that we have examined all exhibit a shifted recut 5. We also note that the reverse of all proof
               and business strikes that we have examined contain what appears to be the remaining portion of the serif from the top of the Y to the right of
               the Y in <persName>Penny</persName>, and above the period between the Y in Penny, and the Y in Fishery. While we believe that all such
               specimens were struck from a single pair of dies, we note that lot 204 of the <persName>Dr. A.N. Brushfield</persName> sale by Glendining in
               1945 contained two <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>s pennies, one of which was described as struck from "cracked dies." We also note
               that in his fixed price list No. 12, October 1969, Lot 212, <persName>Warren Baker</persName> offered for sale the following described
               specimen: <q>
                  <persName>Breton</persName> 520. <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> Token, a proof, but due to little rubbing now a.u: a die crack
                  extends from right rim opposite "K" through "N" and to lower rim just left of date.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Regrettably it was not illustrated, and its exact nature cannot now be ascertained. If this specimen is indeed a proof and not a high grade
               business strike from a late state of the die as we suspect, it obviously raises the possibility that more than one obverse die was used as such a
               die break is generally not found in business strikes, and is unknown to the present writers on proofs. That business strikes are known from a
               cracked die is further confirmed by the following example offered for sale by <persName>Warren Baker</persName> in his list No. 32: <q>Lot
                  27. <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny, v.f., obv. corrosion, somewhat affecting some letters, still presentable. Heavy die crack
                  in right obv. border to rim to left rev. border.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We also note a further example in extra fine condition, with a planchet defect at top of coin in the <placeName>United States</placeName> Coin
               Company sale of the <persName>William Earl Hidden</persName> collection (Oct. 15, 1914, lot 17).</p>
            <p>The most colorful description of a <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny is found in the 1884 <persName>H. P. Smith</persName>
               sale of the <persName>Alfred Sandham</persName> and <persName>George Cushing</persName> collection. Lot 148 of that sale which brought
               the sum of $2.10, contains the following entry: <q>1815 <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> Penny: a seal on cake of ice: rev., a dried
                  codfish: this is the finest specimen I have seen: but little circulated: the very bones of the cod are so distinct that one involuntarily

            <p>The American Numismatic Society has a number of <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> pennies in its collection, two of which are described
               and illustrated herein, together with a counterstamped specimen in the author's collection: <q>1. A proof formerly in the collection of
                  Ambassador and <persName>Mrs. R. Henry Norweb, Sr.</persName> and noted in <persName>Mrs. Norweb's</persName> ledger which is also
                  in the Society, as having been obtained from Tennant <ref target="#fig-23">(fig. 1)</ref>. According to <persName>Fred Bowman,
                     William B.</persName>
                  <persName>Tennant</persName> was an enthusiastic collector who was convinced that he had an almost complete collection of Canadian coins
                  and tokens. Following his death in 1943, his collection remained in the hands of his trustees until 1955 when it was purchased by the New
                  Netherlands Coin Company on behalf of <persName>Mr. R. Henry Norweb</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref>

               </figure>
               <q>2. An example in fine condition, which is stamped twice with a quatrefoil, the meaning of which is unknown <ref target="#fig-24">(fig.
                     2)</ref>. This example which is also from the <persName>Norweb</persName> collection, is noted in <persName>Mrs.
                     Norweb's</persName> ledger as having been obtained from Spink and Sons in 1955. We are aware of only three other counterstamped <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> pennies. One counterstamped twice "<persName>Eugene H. Freeman</persName>" was sold at auction in
                  1982 in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref> Unfortunately, the <pb n="55"/> catalogue
                  did not illustrate this lot. Another was described by <persName>D. T. Batty</persName> in 1898 as being slightly circulated with a
                  permanent countermark on obverse not injuring the surface of the coin, which will be further described below. Unfortunately, the countermark
                  was not described. Lastly, we note a low grade specimen in the author's collection that is stamped <persName>W. STEEL</persName> twice on
                  the obverse and numerous times on the reverse <ref target="#fig-25">(fig. 3)</ref>.</q>
               <figure xml:id="fig-25">

               </figure>
               <q>3. A high grade business strike from the collection of <persName>Isaac J. Greenwood</persName> in 1911.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Returning to the relevant numismatic literature, we note that following the publication of <persName>Thomas Sharp's</persName> catalogue of
                  <persName>Sir George Chetwynd's</persName> collection in 1834, there are no references to the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>
               penny until <persName>Rev. Henry Christmas</persName> in 1862. The entry for the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny accurately
               describes it, but does not reveal any information of interest.<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We next note an extreme rarity of Canadian numismatic literature issued in a very small quantity through the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society
               of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> in 1863. Fred Bowman notes that in 1863 Adelard J. Boucher, the first president
               of that society, along with <persName>Joshua L. Brondson</persName>, and <persName>James Rattery</persName>, were commissioned by the
               society to compile a catalogue of Canadian coins. <persName>Bowman</persName> notes that this was the first catalogue of its kind but it was
               never published.<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref> Through the kind assistance of <persName>Warren Baker</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, we had an opportunity to examine one of the few copies in existence of the partially completed
               work which is illustrated with plates by <persName>W. Notman</persName>. Of interest is the following remark: "No precisely corresponding
               half-penny has yet been met with."<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny did not escape the notice of German numismatic writers and collectors. It was listed by <persName>Joseph Neumann</persName> in his exhaustive work on copper coins published in 1863.<ref target="#CH4-n12">12</ref> In addition,
               examples were auctioned in the <placeName>North American</placeName> section of the <persName>Fonrobert</persName> sale in 1877 by <persName>Adolf Weyl</persName> (lot 225); by <persName>Adolph Weyl</persName>
               <pb n="56"/> again in his 147th sale in 1899 (lot 210), and by <persName>Adolph Hess</persName> in 1908 in his sale of the <persName>George F. Ulex</persName> collection (lot 117).</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Alfred Sandham</persName> described the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny in his work on the <hi rend="italic">Coins
                  and Tokens of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>
               </hi> published in 1869.<ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref> His work was illustrated with an excellent line drawing, but shed no light on the
               half-penny.</p>
            <p>James Atkins also described the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny in 1889, noting that the islands contain about 2,000 people who
               are chiefly supported by the cod, herring and seal fisheries. He also pointed out that there was "[b]ut one token and that bears direct reference
               to the prevalent industry."<ref target="#CH4-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Both <persName>Joseph LeRoux, M.D.</persName> in <hi rend="italic">The Canadian Coins Cabinet</hi> published in 1892<ref target="#CH4-n15">15</ref> and <persName>P.N.

               </hi> published in 1894<ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref> shed no further light on the mystery, although <persName>Breton</persName> notes that
               the half penny was never issued.</p>
            <p>The next important reference to the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny is found in <persName>D.T. Batty's</persName> monumental
               catalogue of British and Irish copper.<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref>
               <persName>Batty</persName> described proof pennies in both bronze and copper. He also described a "slightly circulated" penny that had a
               "permanent countermark on O (obverse), without injuring the surface of the coin." He made no comment regarding the half penny.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Robert W. McLachlan</persName> revisited the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny in an address to The Royal Society of
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> in 1915<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref> and again in <hi rend="italic">The
                  Numismatist</hi> that same year but shed no new light on the topic.<ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>William Butler</persName> addressed the topic of the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny in an article in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> in 1924, but again did not add to our information.<ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Romance of <placeName>Canada's</placeName> Money</hi> published in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> in 1933, Paul Montgomery erroneously concluded that the penny in question was coined in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> with a coining press manufactured in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Howard Kurth discussed the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny in 1942 in an extensive article on Canadian tokens. He stated that it
               was the only coin or token that he knew of that depicts a seal. He noted that the token was "quite scarce."<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref> The
               present authors believe that it is only scarce in grades above fine.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Robert C. Willey</persName> in 1958 correctly noted, "this well-made coin comes on a somewhat thicker flan than most pennies of
               the early 19th century. Of some rarity, fine specimens have become ever more difficult to locate."<ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref>
               <persName>Willey</persName> returned to the topic in 1960 and noted that <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> intended to strike half
               pennies, "however, his plans were foiled by the arrival of a British man-of-war with official <pb n="57"/> notification that the right to coin
               money there pertained exclusively to the crown."<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>G. J. Dickie</persName> discussed the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> penny in 1963. He believed that it was unlikely
               that <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> would have brought a cumbersome coin press to the islands, and therefore all of the tokens were struck
               in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Dickie</persName> noted that <persName>Sir
                  Isaac</persName> never revisited the Islands after he distributed his tokens, but that "[h]e and his descendants retained complete, if absentee,
               ownership and control of the islands. The relationship between inhabitants and the Coffin family was frequently stormy, with several rebellions
               against the arbitrary treatment meted out by their absentee landlords." He also noted that in 1903 a Canadian corporation, the "<placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName> Company," bought out the heirs of Coffin, with the result that the islanders had control of their own
               affairs for the first time since 1787.<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Coins of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>,</hi> authors <persName>James A.
                  Haxby</persName> and <persName>Robert C. Willey</persName> noted that there is evidence that the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>
               token also circulated in <placeName>Halifax, Nova Scotia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, we note that <persName>Sir Isaac</persName> was responsible for one other issue of interest to numismatists. It is a medal
               commemorating his ancestor <persName>Tristram Coffin</persName> of <placeName>Nantucket, Massachusetts</placeName>, and listed in <persName>Betts</persName> as number 533 <ref target="#fig-26">(fig. 4)</ref>. <persName>Betts</persName> described the medal as follows:
                  <q>533. Obv. TRISTRAM COFFIN THE FIRST OF THE RACE THAT SETTLED IN <placeName>AMERICA</placeName>. Full length figure standing, facing,
                  doublet, cloak, ruff and hat, upon a pedestal inscribed 1642. His right hand rests on his hip, and in his left hand he holds a staff.</q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Betts</persName> notes that the medal was struck under the direction of Admiral <persName>Sir Isaac Coffin</persName>. He
               felt that it was struck at the beginning of the nineteenth century rather than at the time of the War of Independence as listed in <hi rend="italic">Medallic Illustrations.</hi>

            <p>As an aid in determining pedigree, to assist in determining the known specimens in high grade of the <placeName>Magdalen Island</placeName>

            <p>In conclusion, much remains to be learned about this early Canadian token. The mystery of the so-called half penny may never be solved, although
               we believe, on the scanty evidence in the aforementioned Clay sale, and Sir Edward's memoirs, that patterns may exist. We know that proofs exist
               in both bronze and copper, and that all examples thus far examined by the authors appear to have been struck by just one pair of dies. We also
               know that some specimens were struck from late states of the dies and exhibit die cracks, the precise nature of which will have to await future
               study.</p>

            <p>Golden wedding anniversary medals constitute a rather unusual category of medallions. The type is in no way commonplace, and it seems rather
               extraordinary that <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> can lay claim to two medals of the first part of the nineteenth
               century. It is not peculiar that few such medals exist as couples of the era rarely attained the age together wherein such an event could take
               place. For those who did, it could only have been the elite that would have so distinguished it with the gift of bronze and silver medals
               commemorating the happy occasion.</p>
            <p>One of the early golden wedding medals to come to my attention is that struck in 1730 for <persName>J.P. Winterbach,</persName>
               Burgermeister of <placeName>Rothenburg</placeName> and his wife, <persName>Sophia M. Schilling</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref>
               The first British medal known to me most closely related to our subject is that of the fortieth wedding anniversary of <persName>Peter

                  Gilmor</persName> of <placeName>Baltimore,</placeName> the dies of which were finished in February, 1822, "to commemorate that his father and
               mother had lived in the marriage state in perfect harmony 50 years." According to <persName>Thomason,</persName> "a large number, consisting
               of gold, silver and bronzed, were struck off agreeable to <persName>Mr. Robert Gilmor's</persName> order, and the whole highly
                  approved."<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The two medals to be discussed have the distinction of being amongst the first medals struck for a purely Canadian subject. Earlier <placeName>British</placeName> and French medals commemorating military conquests, and those awarded to the <placeName>Indians</placeName> as
               tokens of allegiance to either crown, are considered as representative of their respective nations.</p>
            <p>In the case of the first medal, that of <persName>Powell/Murray,</persName>
               <ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> it goes unchallenged as the first for Upper Canada. The <placeName>Quebec</placeName> Fishing Club medal,<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> according to <persName>Norman Willis</persName> bears "the earliest date, 1825, on a medal assumed to be of
               wholly Canadian origin ..."<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref> In fact this is an error originating with <persName>Leroux</persName>, who while
               giving the proper date, 1826, in his text description, illustrated the piece with the date 1825. The mistake was repeated by <persName>Breton</persName>, through to <persName>Willis</persName> 80 years later. At the same time <persName>Willis</persName> rightly points
               out that the date on the medal probably represents the year in which the club was established, not necessarily the year of its issuance.
               Nevertheless, if we take the dates indicated on the medals, viz. that of Oct. 3, 1825 for the Powell medal, and July 1826 for the <placeName>Quebec</placeName> Fishing Club piece, the Powell clearly antedates the latter by a full nine months, and takes the place of honor as
                  <placeName>Canada's</placeName> first medal. <persName>McLachlan's</persName> description of the medal is as follows: <pb n="65"/>

               <persName>William Dummer Powell</persName> and <persName>Anne Murray</persName>
               <ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref> were married in Boston in 1775 after what appears to have been a very short courtship. The wedding took place
               without parental consent. Opposed to the revolutionary party, William decided to leave <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North
                  America</placeName>, sailing for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> with <persName>Anne</persName> soon after the
               marriage. They lived variously in <placeName>Norfolk, London</placeName> and <persName>Norwich</persName> while <persName>William</persName> studied law in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>. By 1779, unable to afford the fees for his formal
               call to the bar, he departed for <placeName>Quebec</placeName> on the recommendation of <persName>William</persName> Grant, former
               attorney general of <placeName>Quebec</placeName>, a relative of <persName>Powell's</persName> mother. However, Powell was not well
               received. The Governor, <persName>Sir Frederick Haldimand</persName>, had an aversion to Americans, and considered all, even loyalists, to
               be tainted. To make matters worse for <persName>Powell,</persName> he considered lawyers contemptible. It was therefore recommended to
               Powell by the then attorney general, <persName>James Monk,</persName>
               <ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> and a brother-in-law to be, <persName>Isaac Winslow Clarke</persName>, the deputy commissary general, that he
               quit the capital and set up private practice in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. This suggestion he immediately
               seized upon and his practice soon developed into a highly successful one, enabling him to acquire a house on <placeName>Mount
                  Royal</placeName> for his wife and three sons whom he had brought out from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. His first
               and most famous case was the defence of <persName>Pierre du Calvet</persName> charged with libelling two of the judges of the Court of
               Common Pleas. <persName>Powell</persName> had been advised not to take the case, advice he chose to ignore. He triumphed in the matter, but
               it was an unpopular victory and with it he earned for himself the enmity of several of the ruling class. There soon after were accusations
               concerning his loyalty, suspicions that were renewed by his enemies time and again throughout his life.</p>
            <p>In 1789, <persName>Powell</persName> was appointed first judge of common pleas at Detroit, a position he occupied not without severe
               problems as well as a couple of lengthy leaves of absence, for about five years. At this time, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4990729">Detroit</placeName> and <placeName>Michilimackinac</placeName> were controlled by <placeName>Britain</placeName> and were under the
               jurisdiction of the District of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. As important fur trade centers, it had proven a
               great inconvenience that no courts closer than <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> could handle the quantity of
               litigation that would naturally occur in the course of the complicated trade. <persName>Powell</persName> had either represented or opposed
               many of the prime movers in the trade, such <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> merchant outfitters as <persName>McTavish,</persName>
               <persName>Frobisher,</persName>
               <persName>Gregory,</persName>
               <persName>Richardson,</persName> and <persName>McGill.</persName>
               <ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Constitutional Act of 1791 had divided the province of <placeName>Quebec</placeName> into the two provinces of Upper and Lower <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. The former's capital was at <placeName>Newark</placeName>,<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref>
               <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, and the first administrator of the province was Lieutenant-Governor <persName>John Graves <pb n="67"/> Simcoe.</persName>
               <persName>Powell</persName> had hoped that on the formation of a new province he would be elected its first Chief Justice, but was passed
               over for the less experienced <persName>William Osgoode</persName>. In October 1794, his tenure at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4990729">Detroit</placeName> having ended, he removed to <placeName>Niagara.</placeName> The position of Chief Justice would
               further elude him under successive Lieutenant-Governors, <persName>Peter Russell</persName> and <persName>Peter Hunter,</persName> and
               it was not until well toward the end of the administration of Francis Gore that he gained the office he had long felt entitled to.<ref target="#CH5-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Alfred Sandham</persName> is the first to record the <persName>Powell</persName> medal. In 1869, he states, "...during a
               visit to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, in 1825, he (<persName>Powell</persName>) caused dies to be
               prepared, and these medals were struck for circulation among his personal friends. They were in gold, silver, and copper, and the number struck
               was about 60 in all. We have never met with a copy, and are indebted to <persName>Mr. Groh</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> for a rubbing, from which we take the description."<ref target="#CH5-n13">13</ref>
               <persName>McLachlan</persName>, who by 1886 had not seen a specimen of the medal, agreed with <persName>Sandham</persName>'s estimate
               of about 60 medals having been struck, and places it "as of the highest degree of rarity, although it has appeared in sales rather
                  frequently."<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> He knew of but two in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, one in the
               Government Collection at <placeName>Ottawa</placeName> (now National Archives) and the other in a private <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> collection, likely that of <persName>Gerald Hart.</persName>
               <ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The medals that were reported to <persName>Sandham</persName> and <persName>McLachlan</persName> were likely copper examples as it is
               only very much later that silver pieces become recorded. Fifteen of the copper medals and four silver specimens have been accounted for. The
               first silver <persName>Powell</persName> medal to come to my attention had been acquired by <persName>John Ford</persName> from the
               Brand estate. That medal, along with a <persName>Sutherland</persName> silver was exchanged by <persName>Ford</persName> to <persName>Doug Ferguson</persName> around 1964.<ref target="#CH5-n16">16</ref> Another piece had been acquired by a private collector in <placeName>Ontario</placeName> in 1954 from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> dealer, <persName>Jules
                  Mero</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref> A third silver medal, as well as a specimen in copper had been secured in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> by Bill Barrett around 1983.<ref target="#CH5-n18">18</ref> The last of the four silver medals
               known to me was only recently discovered. Appropriately, it was acquired from a <persName>Powell</persName> descendent by an indefatigable
               acquisitor by the name of <persName>Hugh MacMillan.</persName> Other copper medals are reported to be in the hands of family members,
               cherished mementos of an illustrious family. The unique gold medal for <persName>Anne Murray</persName> surfaced in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> only four years ago. It was purchased from a collector who had acquired it from a local <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> coin dealer. The medal had, previous to that, belonged to a descendent who, quite
               properly, had the given name <persName>William</persName> Dummer Powell.<ref target="#CH5-n19">19</ref> As late as the 1970s, he was said to
               have been seen scuba diving in <placeName>Boca Raton, Florida,</placeName> sporting the medal suspended from a chain around his neck.<ref target="#CH5-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="68"/>
            <p>When the <persName>Powell/Murray</persName> medals were actually struck and distributed will probably never be known with certainty, but in
               order to arrive at a likely approximation it is necessary to trace <persName>William's</persName> movements from sometime before the
               anniversary, as well as for the period shortly after the event.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Powell</persName> had been hurt and angered as a result of having been replaced as commissioner to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in the matter of settling the division of customs duties between Upper and Lower <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. His replacement was <persName>John Beverley Robinson,</persName> the attorney general, a man
                  <persName>Powell</persName> considered his prot�g�. In need of a rest, <persName>Powell</persName> indicated his intention of going
               to <placeName>Bermuda.</placeName> Instead, around January 21, 1822, he left for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, via <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. He would, at the same time, try to obtain a sum he
               considered long due him from the government.<ref target="#CH5-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The thought of a medal for his beloved <persName>Anne</persName> for their approaching fiftieth anniversary could have been on <persName>William's</persName> mind when in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> in 1822. The <persName>Gilmor</persName> medal had been struck earlier that year and could possibly have come to his attention if he had made inquiries about having one
               made. On April 20 of that year he writes (from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>) that he would "even coin myself into
               Gold if I could thereby afford you a single Hour of perfect Satisfaction. Mine and my highest is the grateful remembrance of your past kindness
               and the delightful hope of still experiencing in your affection the only solid Comfort I have ever known. God bless and preserve you all."<ref target="#CH5-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>But if <persName>Powell</persName> at that time had contemplated a medal, the thought must soon have been abandoned, for two days later
               occurred one of the great tragedies in the <persName>Powells'</persName> lives. Their daughter, <persName>Anne,</persName> had had an
               infatuation with <persName>John Beverley Robinson</persName>. <persName>Robinson</persName> had travelled to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> after the War of 1812 in order to further his legal training. <persName>Anne</persName> had
               succeeded in convincing her father that she should accompany him to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and arrived a
               few months after <persName>Robinson,</persName> only to find that he had become engaged to a lady named <persName>Emma
                  Walker</persName>. <persName>Robinson</persName> family legend has it that <persName>Anne</persName> continued her pursuit of <persName>Robinson</persName> in a most obsessive fashion. Nevertheless, five years after his marriage to <persName>Emma
               Walker</persName>, <persName>Robinson</persName> made the mistake of casually inviting <persName>Anne</persName> to travel with him and his
               wife to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n23">23</ref> This was very much against his wife's and
                  <persName>Anne's</persName> family's wishes. <persName>Anne's</persName> family, anticipating her eagerness to join the couple,
               virtually incarcerated her, but she escaped from her home, arriving in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>
               with plans to set sail for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. Her uncle, <persName>George Murray,</persName>
               arranged for her to sail on the <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi>, a ship carrying other female passengers. The ship was caught in a violent <pb n="69"/> storm, and after taking on water for several days, was wrecked off the coast of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>. <persName>Anne</persName> was drowned in full sight of horrified spectators on the shore. Her death absolutely
               devastated the <persName>Powells.</persName>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Powell</persName> returned home to <placeName>York</placeName> after making the final arrangements for his daughter, <persName>Anne,</persName> who was buried in the churchyard of <placeName>Templetrine</placeName>. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, he had stayed with his brother-in-law, <persName>Charles Murray,</persName> and an active
               exchange of letters was carried on after <persName>Powell's</persName> return to <placeName>York.</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH5-n24">24</ref>
               <persName>Murray</persName> may well have been helpful in procuring the medals for the couple's anniversary. Seventeen years later, no doubt
               influenced by the medal for their aunt and uncle, the children of <persName>Charles and Elizabeth</persName>
               <persName>Murray</persName> had struck a medal to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of their parent's marriage.<ref target="#CH5-n25">25</ref> The medal's design, however, is entirely different, and the sentiment is a family one, rather than a personal one as exhibited on
               the <persName>Powell</persName> medal. The description of the medal is as follows: <q>Obv. SOLE DEO GLORIA above a closed wreath.</q>

            <p>One would have expected the <persName>Powell/Murray</persName> anniversary to have been the social event of the year, attended by members of
               the Family Compact as well as friends and relatives from afar. The occasion is virtually never mentioned.<ref target="#CH5-n26">26</ref> In fact,
               this was a very unhappy period of their lives. <persName>Powell's</persName> earlier discontent over not having been named commissioner to
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> had escalated into open rancor. <pb n="70"/> He offended other members of the
               Executive Council with the publication of two pamphlets in late 1824 which assailed the Governor, <persName>Sir Peregrine
                  Maitland,</persName> and addressed the slight he had felt in the case of <persName>John Beverley Robinson.</persName> The material that he
               used for these attacks was of a private nature, being personal correspondence. This sounded the end of a long and brilliant career for <persName>Powell.</persName> He sat as Chief Justice and Speaker for the last time on July 2, 1825, and was obliged to resign from the
               Executive Council in September, being replaced by <persName>William Campbell</persName> as both speaker and Chief Justice on October 24,
               1825, a mere three weeks after the golden wedding anniversary.</p>
            <p>The only reference found concerning the celebration, if such it can be called, comes in a very subdued letter to his brother-in-law, <persName>George Murray</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, written on October 8, from
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. <persName>Powell</persName> had left <placeName>York</placeName> for
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> the day after the anniversary: "... your Sister wears well and supports the
               Change [<persName>Powell's</persName> retirement] without complaint &amp; I believe feels no regret but the diminished power of rendering
               service. We celebrated, without even Cake or Wine the fiftieth Anniversary of our wedding day the 3rd inst but tho the feast was wanting at the
               table, the Heart felt nothing wanting"<ref target="#CH5-n27">27</ref> This hardly smacks of a gala where copper and silver medals, and a special
               one-of-a-kind gold jewel for <persName>Anne,</persName> were being cheerfully distributed.</p>

               is similar, though not identical to that of the Powell. On the obverse, the base of the tablet is squared, whereas it is angular on the <persName>Powell</persName> medal. The lover's knots on the reverse are somewhat more delicately com- <pb n="71"/> posed in the case of the
                  <persName>Sutherland</persName> piece, but the execution and relief of the <persName>Powell</persName> medal is superior to the
                  <persName>Sutherland</persName>. This suggests that the <persName>Sutherland</persName> medal was not engraved by the same artist
               nor struck by the same firm.<ref target="#CH5-n30">30</ref>

               <persName>Daniel Sutherland</persName> was born in <placeName>Ayrshire, Scotland,</placeName> in 1756 and was in the Province of <placeName>Quebec</placeName> at least as early as April 1778. That year he entered into the business of the fur trade as a merchant outfitter
               with <persName>John Porteous</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. By 1781, the partnership with
                  <persName>Porteous</persName> having been dissolved, he signed an agreement with <persName>James Grant</persName>. Later that year,
               he married <persName>Margaret Robertson</persName>, a daughter of Captain <persName>Daniel Robertson,</persName> commander of the post
               of <placeName>Michilimackinac</placeName> from 1782-87.<ref target="#CH5-n32">32</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A letter from <persName>Sutherland</persName> to <persName>Powell</persName> suggests a warm friendship existed between the two
               couples, and it is apparent that <persName>Sutherland</persName> had one of the <persName>Powell/Murray</persName> medals. Dated from
                  <placeName>Quebec</placeName>, the August 17, 1831, he writes: <q>My Dear Sir</q>
               <q>As the 1st of September is fast approaching, &amp; is the fiftieth anniversary of our marriage, I wished to surprise <persName>Mrs.
                     S.</persName> on that occasion with a gold medal, but cannot find any workmen here capable of striking one; may I therefore request the favor
                  of your informing me where yours were made? Have the goodness to remember me most cordially to <persName>Mrs. Powell</persName> in which
                     <persName>Mrs. Hallowell</persName> begs leave to join, as also to <persName>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jarvis &amp; Miss Powell. Mrs.
                     Sutherland</persName> is still absent, but expected to-morrow.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A postscript on the back states: <q>Have the goodness to say what the die &amp; each of the bronze &amp; silver medals cost you, that I may
                  provide according'y, whether in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, or the United States. Excuse this liberty &amp;
                  oblige D.S.<ref target="#CH5-n33">33</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Alas, the letter responding to this question, if indeed there was an answer, is not extant or has yet to be located. This may be due to the fact
               that the <persName>Sutherland</persName> family papers, in contrast to those of the <persName>Powell</persName> family, are unlocated,
               perhaps yet with descendants, or destroyed.</p>
            <p>Doubtless, the <persName>Sutherland</persName>/<persName>Robertson</persName> medal could not have been struck in time for the
               celebration. Assuming <persName>Powell</persName> was to write <persName>Sutherland</persName> with the information by return mail, the
               answer could have arrived no earlier in <placeName>Quebec</placeName> than the first couple of days of September. The letter would have
               probably been sent overland to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> on one of the fast sailing packets which
               would arrive in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> in about a month. Clearly, the medals could not have arrived in <placeName>Quebec</placeName> before the end of May or beginning of June the following year. Let us hope they arrived by then, for two months <pb n="73"/> later, on August 19, 1832, <persName>Sutherland</persName> became another victim of the cholera epidemic which had been
               particularly devastating in <placeName>Quebec</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> that year. Had
               there been a delay in the striking of the medals, or in shipping them out, it is entirely possible that <persName>Sutherland</persName>
               never saw them. Margaret Robertson eventually must have received her gold medal. The discovery of an inventory of her estate, found by <persName>McLachlan</persName> in the files of <persName>John Griffin,</persName> the notary, an early associate of <persName>Daniel Sutherland</persName>, is of great interest: "One Gold Medal, value 40 Shillings." <persName>McLachlan</persName> states, "at the
               rate of 5 shillings currency to the dollar, this would give its estimated value as $8.00, which taking the size of the medal into consideration,
               being larger than a $20 gold piece, would indicate that it was only plated or that the appraisers did not know its value."<ref target="#CH5-n34">34</ref> The assessment was under the heading of "Trinkets," so little thought was given to the medal, but it is probable that the medal
               valued at 40 shillings was the <persName>Sutherland</persName>/<persName>Robertson</persName> commemorative.</p>
            <p>The <persName>Sutherland</persName> medal was apparently unknown to <persName>Sandham</persName> and is first described by <persName>McLachlan</persName> who took his description from a specimen in the collection of the <placeName>Quebec</placeName> numismatist,
               Cyrille Tessier, apparently a descendent of the couple.<ref target="#CH5-n35">35</ref> It is rarer than the <persName>Powell</persName>
               medal although the celebration, in contrast to that of the <persName>Powells',</persName> appears to have been joyous and well attended. The
               event also received appropriate attention in the press which recorded the celebration: <q>On Thursday evening last an elegant entertainment was
                  given by Mr. and Mrs. <persName>Sutherland</persName> at their house on <persName>St. Ursule St.</persName> in celebration of their
                  50th anniversary of their wedding day. About 200 persons were present. It was gratifying to see the hospitable host and hostess appear in
                  excellent health and spirits. F�tes in commemoration of the grand jubilee of the day of marriage cannot be of every day occurrence, and when
                  they do happen, it is still more rare to find both parties able to endure, much less to promote with so much hilarity, the festivities of an
                  evening party in the manner which was done on the occasion we record.<ref target="#CH5-n36">36</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The quantity of medals struck would likely coincide with the size of the respective families. The <persName>Powells'</persName> family far
               exceeded that of the <persName>Sutherland</persName>s'. The medals, which were unquestionably not given at the celebrations, were likely
               presented to family members only, with perhaps the occasional one to a close friend.<ref target="#CH5-n37">37</ref> Based on the known medals,
               and the fact that <persName>Sutherland</persName> pieces appear to be much scarcer than those for the <persName>Powell</persName>
               anniversary, it is my opi- <pb n="74"/> nion that silver medals were given to the children, while sisters, brothers, grandchildren, etc. would
               have been offered copper ones. The Powells had five surviving children, and about ten grandchildren as well as several brothers and sisters each.
               The <persName>Sutherland</persName>s had three children, and Daniel had two sisters; his wife, <persName>Margaret Robertson,</persName>
               had two sisters and a brother. This would suggest that there were five silver medals for the <persName>Powell</persName> children, of which
               four are located today, and a goodly number of copper examples for the large <persName>Powell/Murray</persName> family.<ref target="#CH5-n38">38</ref> The <persName>Sutherland</persName>s would have had three silver medals struck of which two are known today;
               the copper specimens were, due to the small size of the family, probably struck in a very limited quantity, accounting for its scarcity
                  today.<ref target="#CH5-n39">39</ref> The gold medal is as yet unlocated, a challenge for some enterprising numismatist.</p>
            <p>When did <persName>Powell and Sutherland</persName> meet and develop what would be a lifetime friendship? The precise date is not known, but
               it would likely have been around 1787 when <persName>Powell</persName> represented many of the more important fur trade interests in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. <persName>Sutherland</persName> was in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4990729">Detroit</placeName> in 1791 and would no doubt have come into contact with Powell. His father-in-law, <persName>Daniel Robertson,</persName> as commander at <placeName>Michilimackinac</placeName> would certainly have been well known to <persName>Powell</persName> when judge at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4990729">Detroit</placeName>. By 1790, <persName>Sutherland</persName> was offered a share in the North West Company, but in 1795, suffering financial problems, he sold his interest back. Three
               years later, he became involved in a new firm, the New North West Company, sometimes styled the XY Company, probably to differentiate the bale
               markings XY from those of the NW Company. In 1806, two years after the amalgamation of the old and new company, he retired from the fur trade. In
               1807, he was appointed postmaster of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, and in 1816, moving to <placeName>Quebec</placeName>, succeeded <persName>George Heriot</persName> as deputy postmaster general of British <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName>. In 1827 he retired from the Post Office, his son-in-law, <persName>Thomas Allen
                  Stayner</persName> succeeding him as the new deputy postmaster general.<ref target="#CH5-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Many years later that friendship, now between the two couples, was firmly established. <persName>Powell</persName> had visited the <persName>Sutherland</persName>s shortly after his anniversary, on his trip to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>.
                  <persName>Anne</persName> writes <persName>William</persName> (in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>)
               from <placeName>York</placeName> on October 27, 1825: "I hope you will assure the <persName>Sutherland</persName>s and other friends (if
               there are any) of my regards."<ref target="#CH5-n41">41</ref> Another letter, from <persName>William</persName> to <persName>Anne</persName> on November 1, 1825, likely in response to hers of the 27th, states: "... <persName>Sutherland</persName> and his family,
               the Coffins and their connections, and the <persName>Taylors</persName> are warm in their expressions of grateful remembrance of your
               virtues and kindness to them ..."<ref target="#CH5-n42">42</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="75"/>
            <p>The issue of where the <persName>Powell/Murray</persName> and <persName>Sutherland</persName>/<persName>Robertson</persName>
               medals were struck is yet another question that may never be absolutely proven. There is no evidence that any medals were struck in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> until the 1830s.<ref target="#CH5-n43">43</ref> In the case of the <persName>Sutherland</persName>/Robertson medal, there having been such a rush, it is likely that a manufacturer in the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> was sought in order to expedite the production of the medal.<ref target="#CH5-n44">44</ref> But the superior <persName>Powell</persName> medal could have only been produced in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, and it is likely that it
               came from the <persName>Thomason</persName> manufactory. In his memoirs <persName>Sir Edward Thomason</persName> makes the following
               rather bold statement: <q>His Royal Highness the <placeName>Duke of Saxe Weimar</placeName>, in 1825 and 1826, travelled through the <placeName>United States,</placeName> and I understood he was present at the completion of the Grand Canal, uniting the <placeName>Erie</placeName> with the <placeName>Atlantic.</placeName> The American Government employed their best artist in medal engraving to engrave
                  a pair of medal dies (of small size, about one inch and a quarter in diameter) to commemorate this important undertaking, which was
                  accomplished towards the end of the year 1825.</q>
               <q>The Duke, on his return, landed at <placeName>Liverpool,</placeName> and called upon me as he passed through <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName>, and was so obliging as to present me with one of the American medals. His Royal Highness was
                  well aware of the inferiority of the workmanship, both as to the execution of the dies and the making of the medal; but it was the best their
                  artist could do. As so important an event was worth recording upon a medal, I had a pair of dies engraved, about four times the size, by one
                  of my first artists, the <hi rend="italic">allegory</hi> of the medal being exactly a <hi rend="italic">facsimile</hi> of theirs. On the <hi rend="italic">Obverse</hi> was a River God encouraging Neptune for a time, whilst he conducted him to the River Erie, the <hi rend="italic">Legend</hi>, "Union of Erie with the Atlantic." On the <hi rend="italic">Reverse</hi> was the Eagle standing upon, and in the attitude of
                  protecting one-half of the Globe. A ship at a distance— an escutcheon with the sun rising out of the water, and in a garter the word
                  EXCELSIOR. The Legend "Erie Canal, commenced 4th July, 1817, completed 26th October, 1825."</q>
               <q>The Americans were delighted with this production, and seemed to acknowledge, without jealousy, the vast distinction between English and
                  American artists.<ref target="#CH5-n45">45</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Clearly, <persName>Thomason</persName> was seeking an entry into the <placeName>North American</placeName> market, boasting that his
               product was far superior to anything in <pb n="76"/> the United States. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> would
               certainly be a prime marketplace, there being no facilities for the striking of medals. It is possible that <persName>Powell</persName> had
               been aware of a medal for a fellow <placeName>North American</placeName> in 1822, and had one ordered on his return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in 1826 while awaiting <persName>Anne</persName> who was to make the sacrifice of leaving her
               children behind to follow <persName>William</persName> later in the year. A gold medal would have been a deserving reward.</p>
            <p>The friendship between the two couples likely dates from before <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> was divided in 1791
               when it incorporated the vast area called the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>n Territories, from the junction of the
               Ohio and Mississippi, northward to the southern boundary of the <persName>Hudson's</persName> Bay Company lands. It is fitting that two of
                  <placeName>Canada's</placeName> earliest medals commemorate two of its important families, in both government and mercantile affairs, and
               represent the capitals of both the Upper and Lower Canadian provinces.</p>

               <p>This is a reversal of what I had originally stated. It became apparent to me shortly after this paper was presented that the medals showed
                  sufficient differences in weight, fabric, and, most importantly workmanship. Also, the stock design and letter punches would probably still be
                  in the hands of the original firm responsible for the <persName>Powell</persName> medal. I subsequently sent the medals to <persName>Michael Hodder</persName> who stated the same view.</p>

            <p>The discussion of Canadian numismatics in a historical context can engender some discomfort. First, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> does not have a long numismatic history and then, when a national currency did appear, it had very
               little relationship to the monetary difficulties of earlier times. It does not reflect the struggles and the problems with which the average
               person, whether consumer, shop-keeper or manufacturer, had to contend in carrying out his daily activity. However, there is an area of Canadian
               numismatics which does reflect these difficulties, that is paper money and the institutions which issued it. Until the eve of Confederation,
               paper money was issued and circulated by the various banks which operated under provincial charters. Some of these were founded to satisfy a real
               economic need; some because business interests in a given district felt that they were not being treated fairly by the existing banks; and still
               others as a matter of civic pride.</p>
            <p>One of the puzzles in the Canadian bank note field is the so-called "English Issues" of the 1850s of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. Discussion of this topic requires consideration of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> itself, some of the principles by which Canadian banks functioned, and then the notes
                  themselves.<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, founded in 1817, was for over 100 years the dominant bank in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, although from time to time it was forced to share some of its prominence with other
               institutions such as the Bank of British <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The bank was founded as the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> Bank and opened on November 27, 1817. The directors
               authorized the opening of an agency in <placeName>Quebec</placeName> on December 17, 1817. The opening of agencies in Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> soon followed: Kingston and <placeName>York</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>) in 1818, Queenston and Amherstburg in 1819 and Perth in 1820. In 1822, the directors of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> Bank received a charter from the Legislature of Lower <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> to operate under the name The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>.</p>
            <p>In 1824 the Legislature of Upper Canada, influenced by its own supporters and by local business interests which had favored the opening of The
               Bank of Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, <placeName>York</placeName> in 1821, enacted legislation
               prohibiting banking operations in the province unless the head office of the bank was also located in the province. As a result of this
               legislation the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> closed its agencies in Upper Canada.</p>
            <p>During the next 15 years the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> conducted its affairs in a steady, if
               unspectacular manner. It took over the business of the faltering Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, another
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> based bank which found itself in difficulty. Surviving the depression of
               1837-38 and <pb n="83"/> the Rebellions of the same years, the bank again cast its eyes toward the business market of Upper Canada. This time in
               1840, to comply with the provincial legislation, it purchased the Bank of the People which had its head office in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>.</p>
            <p>In 1841, the political situation changed. The Rebellions of 1837-38 in both Upper and Lower <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> had their roots in the conflict between political elite who wanted to retain their aristocratic privilege and reformers who
               wanted a representative government. The rebellions were put down but as a consequence, the two <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>s were united to form the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, with first Kingston, then
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> as its capital. Lower <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> was designated <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East and Upper Canada, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West.</p>
            <p>With the new political arrangement the banks, in theory, could operate anywhere in the province. In reality, however, the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> still did not have the authority to open branches or agencies in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West until the proclamation of the Currency and Banking Acts in April 1842. Within a week of the
               passing of the Bank Act, the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> closed the Bank of the People and operated a
               branch in its own name out of the premises of the Bank of the People.</p>
            <p>The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> reorganized to meet the new challenge. The province was divided into
               three districts with the head office in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> and district or branch offices in <placeName>Quebec</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>. Each branch office had its own president and
               board of directors with the authority to conduct business, such as establishing agencies in its area, subject to the right of veto, at all times,
               by the Board of Directors in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. The bank notes issued by the district offices were
               to be signed by the branch president and the cashier (manager) and were to be redeemable in specie at that branch. By the fall of 1842 the
               reorganization was complete.</p>
            <p>The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> also served as the Government's bank. In reality, this meant the bank
               held the Government's accounts, advanced the Government funds to carry out its obligations, and accordingly enjoyed the major share of the public
               works business.</p>
            <p>In 1849, a bill was introduced in the Legislature to recompense citizens who had suffered losses in the Rebellions. Many of the leaders of the
               Rebellions were now sitting as members of the Legislature, as were their former opponents. Since the rebels had suffered most of the losses, the
               loyalists felt and argued that under the terms of the bill the rebels would be rewarded for their treason. Feelings on both sides ran high. The
               bill passed and when the Governor-General, <persName>Lord Elgin</persName> (of the <persName>Elgin Marbles</persName> fame) signed,
               giving Royal assent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, rioting broke out <pb n="84"/> in the streets of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, led by the loyalist(?) middle class element who resented their tax money being spent in this manner. On April 25, 1849, the
               Parliament House in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> was burned to the ground. The Government then moved to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that, when the Government moved from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>, the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> lost its position as
               the Government's bank to the Bank of Upper <placeName>Canada.</placeName> This is simply not the case. Bank management was becoming more
               concerned about the Government's methods of financing its obligations. The Government approached both the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> and the Bank of British <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> and
               when both respectfully declined, then turned to the Bank of Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> which became the
               Government's bank from January 8, 1850 to December 31, 1863.</p>
            <p>The provincial Government found itself in constant need of more and more revenue to finance its commitments. As early as 1848, <persName>Francis Hincks,</persName> the Inspector General, in effect the Minister of Finance, realized that issuing its own notes was a most effective way
               of increasing government revenue. The chartered banks who had the sole responsibility for issuing notes under the terms of their charters
               bitterly opposed what they perceived to be government intrusion into their traditional domain. So in 1866 when <persName>Alexander
                  Galt,</persName> the current Minister of Finance, again proposed that, in return for certain government concessions, the banks suspend their own
               note issues and act as fiscal agents for the Government, only <persName>E.H. King,</persName> general manager of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> agreed. The Government's offer was not restricted but in reality there were only four
               banks with branch networks capable of carrying out note distribution throughout the entire province.</p>
            <p>The Commercial Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and the Bank of Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> had their own financial problems as a result of railroad speculation, the collapse of land values,
               and the depression of 1857-58. The last thing in the world these institutions desired was surrendering a sure source of revenue, or closer
               government scrutiny of their affairs. The Bank of British <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName>, with its Board of
               Directors in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, was not really interested in resolving Canadian political
               difficulties. The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> suspended its own note issue in 1866. This arrangement
               remained, even after Confederation, until 1871 when the Ministry of Finance assumed responsibility for the new Dominion's note issues.</p>
            <p>The management of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> has been praised for its farsightedness in accepting
               the government proposal. Indeed the close association between the bank and the Government continued long after the formal dissolution of the
               agreement in 1871. The Bank <pb n="85"/> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> continued to serve as the Dominion
               Government's Bank in both domestic and foreign fiscal matters until the formation of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> in 1934.</p>
            <p>The development of banks and banking in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> followed quite a different path from that in
                  <placeName>United States</placeName>. In the <placeName>United States</placeName> banks sprang up in communities as individual,
               independent, local enterprises. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, banking followed the branch bank system. One of
               the enduring myths in Canadian numismatics is that branch banking in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> was borrowed
               from the Scottish system. The Bank of British <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> basically followed Scottish
               banking practices and is generally credited with introducing branch banking into <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.
               However, as the Bank of British <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> did not operate in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> until 1837 and, as the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>
               operated a series of branches from 1818 and, as the Bank of Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> by its charter of
               1819 was required to open and operate branches, let us hope that this myth will be finally laid to rest and that credit for pioneering branch
               banking be given, where it properly belongs, to the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. It is difficult to
               quarrel with <persName>Merrill Dennison,</persName> the author of the <hi rend="italic">History of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>
               </hi> who states, "branch banking [in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>] owed as much to the exigencies of geography
               and politics as to the assimilation of systems elsewhere."</p>
            <p>This branch bank system with a head office and branches or agencies in other areas meant that any branch or agency which found itself in
               difficulty could draw on the resources of the whole bank rather than be forced to face a crisis on its own. One might also argue that the public
               was better protected by use of internal auditors sent by a head office of a bank which had a financial stake in the operation of the branches
               than by state examiners who were public servants.</p>
            <p>In addition to the city where the bank was domiciled, many bank notes also had the name of the branch stamped or engraved on them. This practice
               had its roots in a fundamental economic principle that every nineteenth or early twentieth century Canadian banker knew, but many of us may have
               forgotten. Bank notes were not money, only gold and silver were. Canadian bank notes were, in essence, bearer promissory notes convertible to
               specie on demand. The notes stated clearly "will pay" or "promise to pay the bearer on demand." The purpose of an overprint was not to limit the
               circulation of a note to a particular area, although this was often the effect, but rather to restrict its convertibility. Until 1890, a bank was
               required to redeem its notes only at the head office or at the branch indicated on the note. This measure was designed to prevent other banks
               from amassing quantities of notes, and then presenting them at a small <pb n="86"/> branch which might not have sufficient specie on hand to
               redeem all notes, thereby causing a "run" on the bank.</p>
            <p>After the reorganization of 1842, the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> used two distinct sets of notes—one
               for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East which was subdivided into <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> and <placeName>Quebec</placeName> issues, and the other, with a completely different design, for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West and issued from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-34">
               <graphic url="COAC8_086.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>On the notes dated 1849, the partially engraved date was replaced by the fully engraved date—January 1, 1849, on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East issues and May 1, 1849, on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>
               West issues <ref target="#fig-34">(fig. 1)</ref>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Both issues had red word protectors and space was provided for the
               signatures of two signing officers. The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East issues have the imprint <persName>Rawdon, Wright and Hatch,</persName>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, but the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>
               West issues have <persName>Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson,</persName>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. <persName>Rawdon, <pb n="87"/> Wright &amp; Hatch</persName> had
               printed the earlier <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East issues, whereas the printing of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West issues had been shared by <persName>Rawdon, Wright &amp; Hatch</persName> and by <persName>Danforth, Underwood</persName> &amp; Co. or one of its other reincarnations.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-35">

            </figure>
            <p>We do not know whether the shift of the Government's accounts to the Bank of Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>
               in 1850 had any bearing on the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>'s decision to abandon its separate issues
               for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West, and
               adopt a single issue for the entire Province. However, printer's face proofs on card stock exist for a radical, new issue of notes, with the same
               basic design for all denominations.</p>
            <p>The serial number, the office, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> and the date, July 1, 1851, were added by
               letterpress <ref target="#fig-35">(fig. 2)</ref>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-36">
               <graphic url="COAC8_087b.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>These proofs form the basis for the issue of 1852, the so-called "English Issue" <ref target="#fig-36">(fig. 3)</ref>; an issue which
               conventional wisdom either <pb n="88"/> ignored or dismissed as an issue withdrawn because of extensive counterfeiting.</p>
            <p>As all researchers are aware, one of the most difficult problems to be faced is locating sufficient material on which to base a premise. This
               problem is particularly acute in dealing with bank notes given the fragile nature of the pieces, and it is further compounded if the notes are
               redeemable. Banks were very thorough in withdrawing older notes once a new issue was released, simply to avoid confusion, and in mid-nineteenth
               century <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> no one was putting aside redeemable notes as souvenirs.</p>
            <p>Once the notes were grouped by region, it immediately became clear that the letter prefix established both the district and the denomination. The
               upper letters A, B, and C represented <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, <placeName>Quebec</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>; the lower letter, the denomination from one dollar to ten dollars.</p>

            <p>The <placeName>Quebec</placeName> office and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> office had identical
               denomination letters, while the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> office set aside two letters A &amp; B as
               designations for the one dollar denomination. No notes are known for the letters in brackets. However, the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> $5.00 A/E prefix is substantiated from a photographic counterfeit. It might appear that assigning
               the B prefix to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>
               <hi rend="italic">$</hi>1.00 note is simply a way of making the denomination letter scheme work. I realize that "post hoc, ergo propter hoc"
               reasoning is suspect but a proof sheet of the next issue clearly indicates that the <hi rend="italic">$</hi>1.00 plate had two <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>
               <pb n="89"/>
               <pb n="90"/> notes to one each for <placeName>Quebec</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>
               <ref target="#fig-37">(fig. 4)</ref>. Examination of the notes themselves supports the proposed denomination letter code; the notes were also
               color coded to indicate the district: black-<placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>; blue-<placeName>Quebec</placeName>; red-<placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The 5 digit numbering scheme could accommodate 100,000 notes of each denomination and when this total was reached, the denomination letter and
               the date were changed. As yet we have not been able to determine the quantity of notes issued for each branch within the 100,000 maximum for each
               denomination <ref target="#fig-38">(fig. 5)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The basic design of all denominations was the same. The vignette in the upper left corner depicted the arms of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, flanked by a standing and a seated native. In the upper right corner was the counter but the
               vignettes varied with the denomination. In the lower left, the denomination in dollars was written in full, either with or without a numeral. The
               signature of the signing officer appeared on the lower right.</p>

            <pb n="91"/>
            <p>The name of the Bank, the pledge of redeemability and the values in shillings appear in the upper half of the note. The district office and the
               date, in the center, the serial numbers, and the branch offices at both ends of the note were added by letterpress. The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> also introduced its one signature notes with this issue.</p>
            <p>It is generally believed that, faced with a serious counterfeiting threat, the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> withdrew the issue. However, I believe we should reassess the situation. It would appear that initially the counterfeiting
               involved only the one and two dollar notes <ref target="#fig-39">(fig. 6)</ref>.</p>

            <p>As early as 1853 the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> was considering replacement of the one and two dollar
               denominations. An unissued note, with a blue back dated February 1, 1853, exists. It is generally grouped with the 1856-57 blue back issues but
               the prefix CO clearly links it with the 1852 series <ref target="#fig-40">(fig. 7)</ref>. This is not to say that other <pb n="92"/>
               denominations were not counterfeited, only that they did not appear to constitute a major problem at this time <ref target="#fig-41">(fig.

            <p>Looking at the 1852 issue as a whole, it becomes quite apparent from the prefixes that there was only one issue of notes from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> and <placeName>Quebec</placeName> but that there were two issues of one and two dollar notes
               and three issues of five dollar notes from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>. No genuine issued notes are known with
               a C/I prefix. The C/S prefix is listed on the authority of the late <persName>Lindsey McLennan</persName>, an eminently qualified Canadian
               paper money pioneer. He records the note as being <placeName>Toronto-Hamilton op Guelph</placeName> and gives the number as C/S 17028.</p>
            <p>I have some difficulty in accepting the authenticity of the listing in spite of the details, because it does not seem reasonable that a bank
               could issue 100,000 notes dated February 1, 1853, in the course of one month and then require a subsequent issue of $500,000 dated March 1, 1853,
               unless these issues were intended for use throughout the entire province.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> The C/K issue of the ten dollar note is
               known only from counterfeits.</p>
            <p>One important part of this study which still remains is determining the number of notes issued for each branch within a given denomination letter
               but, at this time, we do not have enough material available to do this.</p>
            <p>This is the issue that cataloguers have identified as the English Issue. I can find no reason or justification for doing so. In fact, it just
               does not make any sense. If one were determined to apply a label to this issue, surely the Uniform or Common Issue of 1852 would be preferable.
               Or better still simply The Issue of 1852.</p>
            <p>The "blue back" issue, the next dated issue chronologically, was introduced in 1856. The initial date is August 1, 1856. In general the notes
               follow the same pattern as the 1852 issue. However, in <pb n="94"/> this case the upper letter D denotes the entire district, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West, rather than the district office, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>.</p>

            <p>The one and two dollar notes were redesigned to increase their security. The quality of the engraving was improved; portraits were employed as
               vignettes, and a block of microprinting involving the <pb n="95"/> denomination in words was added to the face of the note <ref target="#fig-42">(fig. 9)</ref>. The names of subsidiary branches were engraved on a separate plate and inserted on either side of the block of microprinting.
               Other significant characteristics of these notes are the large word denomination beside the lower left counter and the single signature. The
               backs were printed in blue. The most significant change was the replacement of the district office <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>, with a series of area branch offices <ref target="#fig-43">(fig. 10)</ref>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-43">

            </figure>
            <p>As before, when 100,000 notes were issued, the denomination letter and the date changed. The four dollar note retained its original design and
               upper letter designation (C), but the district office was replaced by an area branch office. The five and ten dollar notes of the 1852 issue
               remained in use.</p>
            <p>The issue gives rise to some intriguing questions. Why are the notes all domiciled in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West? What was happening in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East? and perhaps the most fundamental
               of all: did the district offices continue to issue notes and if so, which notes?</p>
            <p>The answer lies in a third issue of notes; an issue whose association with the 1850s has been either unappreciated or ignored—the issue of one
               and two dollar notes dated January 1, 1849, with a green word protector. The basic design reverted to the 1849 notes of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East, except for the word denomination at the lower left and the single signature at the lower
               right.</p>
            <p>I thought it all worked out. The issue consisted of only one and two dollar notes and was issued from the three district offices; <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, <placeName>Quebec</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>, while the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West notes were issued from the area branch offices
                  <ref target="#fig-44">(fig. 11)</ref>.</p>
            <p>However, closer examination of the notes themselves forced me to abandon this theory. First, it did not take into account the rare <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West area branch offices on the green protector notes and second, all the <placeName>Quebec</placeName> notes were printed after May 1, 1858.</p>
            <pb n="96"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-44">

            <p>The 1849 issue with green protector was issued from the three district offices and two area branch offices—<placeName>Cobourg and
                  Hamilton</placeName>
               <ref target="#fig-45">(fig. 12)</ref>. It may be divided conveniently into two parts: notes without the ABN logo and those with the logo. The
               notes with the logo can be dated after May 1, 1858, the official date of the founding of the American Bank Note Company. None of the <placeName>Cobourg and Hamilton</placeName> issues has the logo but, at the same time, all the <placeName>Quebec</placeName> notes do. Since
               the serial number on one note is 00010, it is extremely unlikely that there are <placeName>Quebec</placeName> issues without the logo. The
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> issues occur
               with and without the logo.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-45">
               <graphic url="COAC8_097.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The starting date for the issue is the critical point. Does it predate the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West
               issue or does it follow it? I believe that the use of the green protector provides the answer. There is a two dollar note with a green protector
               in the 1852 issue. This is the note which provides the link between the 1852 issue and the 1849 green pro- <pb n="98"/> tector notes. There is
               also a five dollar note of the same issue, with a green protector. This note comes near the end of the first 100,000 notes of the issue <ref target="#fig-46">(fig. 13)</ref>. These are the only two 1852 notes known with green protectors. I would argue that the 1849 green protector
               notes were issued between the 1852 and 1856 issues. It does not seem logical to issue the 1856 notes, follow them with the 1849 green protector
               issue and then reissue the discredited 1852 notes, even with a green protector.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-46">

            </figure>
            <p>The green protector notes were printed from plates prepared by Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson, the foremost security printers of the day, and
               all had 5 digit serial numbers. When the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West issue, also consisting of one and two
               dollar notes and dated August 1, 1856, was introduced, the Bank withdrew the 1849 green protector notes with area branch office designations but
               continued to issue the notes from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. Notes from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> office made up the
               bulk of the issue.</p>
            <p>In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> issues, the change from no logo to logo notes occurred between 28000 and 31000
               for the one dollar notes. The highest number recorded for a one dollar with the logo, i.e. after May 1, 1858, is 38188. There are no known two
               dollar notes with the logo. It would appear that the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West issues filled the
               need.</p>
            <p>In the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> issues, the change from no logo to logo notes occurred between 71000 and
               81000 for one dollar notes and somewhere between 2800 and 95000 for two dollar notes. However, unlike the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> issues the serial numbers in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> one
               dollar series increased to 6 digits with the highest known number being 157163. As indicated earlier all the <placeName>Quebec</placeName>
               issues carried the logo. That the 1849 green protector issue began before 1856 and continued beyond 1858 is supported by the evidence of the bank
                  <pb n="99"/> notes.</p>
            <p>The period from 1853 to 1857 was one of prosperity in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West. The Crimean War
               increased the demand for wheat and timber and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West, modern <placeName>Southwestern Ontario,</placeName> had some of the richest farmland in the province. The shipyards of <placeName>Georgian Bay</placeName> were
               booming and railroads were being constructed to speed the delivery of Canadian goods. The Grand Trunk Rail Road was being constructed to link
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> with the Great Lakes port of Sarnia. The Great Western was under construction
               from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> and then on to
               Windsor. Indeed the branch names on the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> notes, <placeName>Hamilton, Brantford, Woodstock,</placeName>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, read like station stops on the Great Western. <placeName>Goderich on Lake
                  Huron</placeName> sent salt and other goods to the Upper Great Lakes or south to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> and
               the <placeName>Mississippi valley.</placeName> The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> was an integral part
               of this development.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the previous decade had been the period of railroad building in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>
               East. There were only two major commercial centers, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> and <placeName>Quebec</placeName>. The business community was still attempting to recover from the economic collapse of 1847. <persName>Lord
                  Elgin's</persName> letter of April 23, 1849, to Lord Grey paints a very somber picture of the situation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>: "Three quarters of the commercial men are bankrupt and property has fallen 50% in value."</p>
            <p>Given this situation perhaps it is not surprising that the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East issues were cut back
               and there is a strong possibility that, apart from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> one and two dollar notes
               without the logo, the majority of the notes in circulation were supplied by <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West
               issues.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Counterfeiting continued to be a problem but this time, the four, five and ten dollar notes were the targets <ref target="#fig-47">(fig.
                  14)</ref>. These were the <pb n="100"/> old 1852 designs. There are no known counterfeits of one and two dollar notes from either the 1849
               green protector or the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West issues.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-48">

            <p>An entirely spurious issue of five dollar notes dated September 1, 1858, purporting to be domiciled either in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> or <placeName>Quebec</placeName> created havoc with the public <ref target="#fig-48">(fig.
                  15)</ref>. The notes were printed in three colors reflecting the three district offices. The record simply states that all notes dated 1858
               are counterfeit. These notes are so good that, even today, many collectors question the validity of the above statement. But the statement most
               certainly is correct. Simply look at the prefix. While the lower denomination letter I is a legitimate designation for the five dollar
               denomination, there is no way that C, the designation for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> district office,
               could possibly be used for a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> or <placeName>Quebec</placeName> note. The ten
               dollar notes were not quite as deceptive <ref target="#fig-49">(fig. 16)</ref>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-49">
               <graphic url="COAC8_100b.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <pb n="101"/>
            <p>There is one other mystery: the possibility of a very short-lived <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East issue for
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. <ref target="#fig-50">Fig. 17</ref> is an example of a raised counterfeit. The
               N of the word denomination is clearly visible and the microprinting leaves no doubt as to its original value. It is also evident that the
               counterfeit was quite successful as the PAID indicates that it was taken at face value by the Bank.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-50">
               <graphic url="COAC8_101.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>This counterfeit differs from all the rest in that it is a raised note. However, the significance of the original note appears to have been
               totally overlooked. The prefix is EA and the note dated January 2, 1857, is domiciled in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. Instead of a blue back the note has an orange one. The upper letter E is a logical designation for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East and the lower letter A for the one dollar denomination is supported by the N of the word
               denomination ONE, the microprinting on the face and the numeral and words one and une on the back. I believe we are looking at a note of a very
               short-lived, unsuspected <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East issue of one dollar notes parallel to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West issues.</p>
            <p>The release of a complete, new issue of notes, from one to ten dollars, dated January 3, 1859, brought a close to the note issues of the 1850s.
               The 1850s opened and closed with full sets of notes. There are some questions still to be resolved, but shifting the 1849 green protector issue
               to the mid-1850s, a move which is defensible on the basis of the word denomination, single signature, and the use of the green protector itself
               resolves the puzzle of the apparent lack of notes from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> East offices. This
               arrangement of the issues: 1852-53; 1849 green protector; 1856 <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> West also explains
               why there are two sets of notes issued with only one and two dollar denominations.</p>
            <pb n="102"/>
            <p>The records of the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> are, for the most part, silent on the notes of this
               period. We were hoping that the records of the American Bank Note Company might shed more light on the topic but since they are not forthcoming,
               we have to rely on the evidence of the notes themselves.</p>

            <p>In studying the medals relating to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> during the nineteenth century, we find only one
               event marked by an appreciable number of medals, the visit by the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> in 1860. The earliest catalogues of
               these medals were by <persName>Alfred Sandham</persName>, first in his 1869 work, <hi rend="italic">Coins, Tokens and Medals of the Dominion
                  of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>
               </hi>,<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> and later in his lesser known <hi rend="italic">Medals Commemorative of the Visit of H.R.H. The <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> in 1860.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> Since that time, however, cataloguers and collectors have generally disassociated the medals from one another, so
               that they are no longer thought of as memorials of a single event. By examining the circumstances surrounding their issue, we can perhaps undo
               the practice of the last century and present these medals in their original context, as well as demonstrate how medals can be used to establish
               the cultural importance of events generally considered insignificant.</p>
            <p>As an historical event, the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> visit is thought to have little importance. However, to the popular
               imagination of the time, the visit meant a great deal. In addition, it appears to have been the first of many official tours undertaken by the
               British royal family which have made them more accessible to their subjects. Unlike earlier travels, the Prince was accompanied by a corps of
               journalists to report his every move. At least two of these reporters, those from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>
               <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Herald</hi>, later rewrote their dispatches and published them in
               book form. In fact, the tour was so popular that 50 years later, another book was published telling the reminiscences of a midshipman who served
               aboard the ship on which the Prince travelled. Despite its amazingly peripheral relevance to the tour, Lieutenant <persName>Thomas
                  Bunbury Gough</persName> managed to fill a book with his <hi rend="italic">Boyish Reminiscences of His Majesty the King's Visit to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> in 1860</hi>.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Although there seems to have been a desire for some time by Canadians to host a royal visit, the specific request may be traced to an address
               voted by both houses of the Canadian Parliament informing <persName>Queen Victoria</persName> of the approaching completion of a bridge to
               be named in her honor, and requesting that she, or a member of her family, visit <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> for
               the purpose of inaugurating it when completed. The address was carried to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> by the <persName>Hon. H. Smith,</persName> Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. While <persName>Queen Victoria</persName> replied that it would
               be impossible for her to comply personally with the wishes of her Canadian subjects, she did consent to have the <persName>Prince of
                  Wales</persName> journey to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> as her personal representative.<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Having set sail from Plymouth on the frigate <hi rend="italic">HMS Hero</hi>, the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> arrived at <persName>St.John's,</persName> Newfoundland on July 24, 1860. Upon landing, the Prince received addresses from various notables and <pb n="105"/> organizations, saw some of the local sights, and was honored with balls and levees.<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> This was to be a
               standard routine throughout the tour, and one which seems to have changed little in more than 100 years.</p>
            <p>During the Prince's tour, much attention was paid by the popular press to the more social aspects of the visit, such as the many balls and the
               fashions of the participants. In describing a ball held in <placeName>New Brunswick,</placeName>
               <persName>Mr. Woods</persName> of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> wrote: <q>After this, of course, there was another Levee, at which every
                  one was presented; and the local papers explained the niceties of evening dress, and were at pains to point out at length what it meant, and
                  that a dress coat should not be frock coat, or of any color but black, with other valuable and important information with regard to
                  neckerchiefs and waistcoats. Even these slight rules of etiquette were not without their use, and had the effect of keeping the applicants for
                  the honor of presentation within tolerably moderate bounds. There was no limit to the number of those who wished to attend, but there was a
                  most decided limit to the number of dress coats in the province, and the levees were thus kept down.<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mid-nineteenth century, most of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, as well as <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, was not fully developed, or as urban as today. Perhaps <persName>Mr. Woods</persName> should not have been terribly
               surprised that even the elite of Canadian society did not have what in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> would be
               considered proper attire. Still, the people of <placeName>New Brunswick</placeName> were treated well by him; at a people's ball in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> where there were no restrictions as to attire, and the tickets cost one dollar, <persName>Mr. Woods</persName> wrote that: <q>The 'no restrictions as to dress' was popularly interpreted to mean corduroys, brown or gray
                  shooting-jacket, yellow vest, and scarlet necktie, without gloves, or with thick leather ones, as the case may be... The toilets of the
                  ladies, of course, are never alluded to except in terms of praise, but it may be said that I could praise them more if there had not been
                  rather a sameness of bonnets and shawls.<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>While on the many stops of his tour, it might be noted that the Prince did more than attend balls and meet poorly clad colonials; he received
               more than 380 addresses and provided more than 100 replies.<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> In addition, although the visit was generally
               nonpolitical, it should be mentioned that on many occasions, arches were erected <pb n="106"/> by various Orange Societies, which were nearly
               always frustrated in their attempts to have the Prince ride through them.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of the many medals relating to the visit, only one general commemorative was issued, and it was a purely commercial venture. Struck in white
               metal, it bears on the obverse a military bust of the Prince, and on the reverse an eight line inscription within a wreath. At least two
               different varieties exist. The more common of the two depicts the Prince with a moustache, and has a legend in sans sens serif letters. A second
               obverse die using roman letters and portraying th Prince without moustache and in much higher relief was used to strike a quantity of medals
               which were imported by <persName>J. E. Ellis &amp; Co.</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>.<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A number of authorities have written that three different obverse dies were used. Besides the Ellis die, <persName>Sandham</persName> and
                  <persName>McLachlan</persName> claim that two different varieties exist using sans serif letters and low relief. On these medals, the
               Prince is depicted both with and without moustache.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref> Despite the frequency with which a sans serif, no moustache
               medal has been reported, all examples so far examined and noted in catalogues with plates have been of the moustache variety.</p>
            <p>The reporters from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Herald</hi> seemed to have had something of a rivalry going. While in
                  <placeName>Quebec</placeName>, a Grand Ball was given by the Mayor and citizens. Dress, as we have seen, was an important topic to the
               correspondents, and details of the various balls were not treated with any less enthusiasm. The <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> reported that His
               Highness: <q>Danced every dance that was danced between that night and four next morning! Great numbers were at the same time dancing, or rather
                  trying to dance, and knocking against each with an energy and determination that was worthy of a better cause. None could well avoid collision
                  when limited to a spot little larger than an ordinary table-cloth, and the Prince with his fair partners had to run the gauntlet of polkas and
                  waltzes like the rest. During one of these terpsichorean struggles, the Prince caught his spurs in a lady's dress—tripped and fell. He was up
                  again in an instant, laughing heartily, and dancing away more vigorously than ever.</q>
               <q>In its vulgar way the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Herald</hi> did its best to make the Prince appear ridiculous from
                  this little contretemps. Five minutes after the occurrence it was telegraphed to that Journal. Probably in half-an-hour it was known in Texas,
                  while the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> drew attention <pb n="107"/> to the fact in an alarming series of 'headings,' of which the following
                  are only a few:</q>
               <q>"THE CANADIAN COMMOTION.</q>
               <q>"Splendid Splurge of the <placeName>Quebec</placeName>kers.</q>
               <q>"The Prince at the Grand Ball given by the City.</q>
               <q>"He danced Twenty-two Times, tripped and fell, his Beautiful Partner rolling over him.</q>
               <q>"Honi soit qui mal y pense.</q>
               <q>"The Prince immediately picked himself and Partner up and continued the Dance.</q>
               <q>"Terrible flutter of Crinoline."</q>
               <q>Certainly to judge from the accounts in this voracious journal, the fall must have been an extraordinary one, inasmuch as it was detailed in
                  no less than three different ways, and with four different partners. Princes fall very much like other people, and even if they did not, His
                  Royal Highness would have found it most difficult to have touched the floor in the way indicated by the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>,
                  according to which 'he cut his eye' while coming 'heavily on the back of his head'.<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In fact, while the headlines as reported by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent are correct, the incident was actually reported in the
                  <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> as "while dancing a waltz he slipped and fell heavily on the floor, dragging his partner, <persName>Madame Cartier</persName>, the wife of the Canadian Premier, over him. Neither of them were injured, and the Prince instantly jumped up and
               raised the lady so quickly that but few in the room knew of the occurrence. He apologized to Madame C., and continued the dance."<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> Our ancestors, it would seem, were equally as adept in the use of exaggerated headlines as are our
               contemporaries.</p>
            <p>Poor weather travelled with the Prince through much of his tour so that his landing at <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, scheduled for August 24, was delayed due to a heavy storm. Things improved a bit the following day so that the Prince and
               his suite were able to disembark, at which time one gentleman was overheard to remark that "his Royal Highness was not only heir apparent to the
               British throne, but the Raining Prince."<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> Upon arrival on dry land, the Prince was greeted by the usual dignitaries
               and addresses. He then proceeded in procession to his residence while in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, and to
               the Crystal Palace where he inaugurated the Industrial Exhibition of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> and Province
               of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>. The exhibition was opened approximately 10 days early to allow for the Prince's
               schedule and consequently many of the <pb n="108"/> exhibits had not yet arrived. The extra space was put to good use owing to the great crowds
                  present.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Exhibitors were awarded prizes, and given the option of receiving a medal in lieu of cash. The dies were engraved by <persName>J.S.
                  Wyon,</persName> and bear on the obverse the arms of the Board of Arts. The reverse carries a wreath of maple leaves with the commemorative
               inscription EXHIBITION OF/CANADIAN INDUSTRY/OPENING OF/VICTORIA BRIDGE/BY H.R.H./<persName>PRINCE OF WALES</persName>/<placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>/1860. Ten medals were struck in gold, 100 in silver, and 250 in bronze.<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref> According to <persName>Sandham</persName>, the silver was available in place of a ten dollar cash prize, and the bronze in lieu
               of five dollars.</p>
            <p>After inspection of the exhibits, the Prince departed for what was the prime reason of his visit, the opening of the Victoria Bridge.<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref> Commenced in 1854, the bridge was the connecting link of a continuous rail line joining the westernmost limits of
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> with the east. It also offered an outlet to the Atlantic when the St. <placeName>Lawrence</placeName> was closed. Despite the presence of the Prince and the usual complement of dignitaries, the laying of the last
               stone was not a very impressive affair. The visitors were taken by special train to Point St. Charles, the entrance at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> side. After the Prince patted the bed of mortar, the final granite stone was lowered from the
               scaffold into place. Although the arrival of the Prince was met with great enthusiasm, the crowd was silent after the stone was laid, so that the
                  <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent likened it to the laying of a tombstone over the grave of 15 million pounds. The Prince then went
               by car to the middle of the bridge where he drove the final silver rivet. Afterward, the Prince was presented with a gold medal to commemorate
               the occasion, and his suite with similar ones, but in silver.<ref target="#CH7-n18">18</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Besides its use as a commemorative by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> appears to have obtained a
               number of specimens for his personal use. In his memoirs of the voyage of the <hi rend="italic">HMS Hero</hi>, <persName>Thomas
                  Gough</persName> recalled that during the voyage home, on November 9, the Prince's nineteenth birthday, the Prince distributed these
               commemoratives among the crew. <persName>Lt. Gough</persName> wrote: <q>As my turn came, I arrived breathless from a rush up the lower-deck
                  ladder. His Royal Highness laughed at my excitement. "Well, <persName>Mr. Gough,</persName>" he said, "do you want a medal?" "Yes, sir,
                  if you please," I answered. "Teesdale, where's <persName>Mr. Gough"s</persName> medal?" asked His Royal Highness. Major <persName>Teesdale</persName> began looking on the table, where the medals were laid out. I believe he was slow on purpose, <pb n="109"/> to
                  have a joke with me. The Prince went over to the table. "Why, here it is, just in front of you," he said, taking up the case. "So it is, sir,"
                  replied the Major. His Royal Highness handed me the medal, for which I thanked him....The medal was enclosed in a blue morocco case with the
                  Prince's feathers embossed outside; inside was a small slip of paper with <persName>"Mr. Gough,</persName> from A.E.," written on it by
                  His Royal Highness. The medal itself was a beautiful piece of work, by <persName>Wyon,</persName> and it is now amongst my most precious
                     relics.<ref target="#CH7-n19">19</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Although not generally noted, two different reverse dies were used to strike this medal, and can be most easily distinguished by the use of stars
               as opposed to stops on either side of the date. Of the few specimens examined, the bronze medals all have stops, while the solitary silver
               specimen in the cabinet of the American Numismatic Society has stars. While it is possible that the different dies were used to distinguish their
               use, the small number of specimens examined and their lack of pedigrees make any explanation inconclusive.</p>
            <p>In addition to the medals presented by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, two other medals were produced and sold as commercial ventures. The first
               utilizes the same with moustache obverse as the general commemorative described earlier, while the reverse depicts the bridge from the north
               shore, with a train coming out of the north entrance. The medals were produced by an unnamed <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName> firm for Savage &amp; Lyman of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, and were offered for sale in
               silver at $3, bronze at $1, and white metal for 25¢.<ref target="#CH7-n20">20</ref> Judging by the number of surviving specimens, it would seem
               that this offering, at least in white metal, was quite successful. Although LeRoux claims that different varieties exist with the moustache
               longer or shorter ("il y a plusieurs vari�t�s avec la moustache plus ou moins longue," but translated into English as "both with and without
               moustache"), it appears that only one obverse die was used.</p>
            <p>The second commemorative is generally referred to as the Hoffnung medal because the dies were prepared for Mr. Hoffnung of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> who was also its designer. The medal was offered for sale in gold, silver, bronze and white metal,
               with the latter being the most common. Prices ranged from $100 for the gold to $1 for a white metal specimen. <persName>Sandham</persName>
               reports that a gold medal was presented to <persName>Queen Victoria</persName> in July 1860, though a later presentation would not be
                  unlikely.<ref target="#CH7-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The <persName>Hoffnung</persName> medal is a particularly fine example of overcrowding as an attempt seems to have been made to include
               every possible fact or figure within as small a space as possible. On the <pb n="110"/> obverse is a view of the bridge with the arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> above, on either side of which is a lion and unicorn. The names Ross and Stephenson
               inscribed on the ribbon refer to the engineers who designed the bridge. Below is an inscription describing the bridge as the greatest work of
               engineering skill in the world. On the reverse are the royal arms and medallions depicting the Queen, <persName>Prince Albert</persName> and
               the <placeName>Prince of Wales,</placeName> along with a 14 line inscription giving the physical dimensions and statistics of the bridge. Two
               varieties are known; the original states the cost was <hi rend="italic">$5</hi> million, while a subsequent version shows the amount corrected to
               read <hi rend="italic">$7</hi> million. On the latter variety, the 5 can be seen faintly beneath the 7.</p>
            <p>After the formal opening of the bridge, the Prince and his suite returned to one of the workshops of the company where a lunch had been prepared,
               and to which, according to <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Times</hi>, none but
               the uppiest of the uppy were invited. After toasts to the Queen, <persName>Prince Albert</persName> and the <placeName>Prince of
                  Wales,</placeName>
               <persName>Albert Edward</persName> proposed "The health of the Governor General, prosperity to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, and success to the Grand Trunk Railway".</p>
            <p>After <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, the Prince visited <placeName>Ottawa</placeName> where he laid the
               cornerstone for the Parliament buildings, and then toured <placeName>Kingston,</placeName> and on to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName>, where he visited the University and signed his name in the student's book. From the University the
               Prince proceeded to inaugurate the Horticultural Societies' grounds by planting what the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent described as
               "a meek-looking vegetable called a young maple-tree".<ref target="#CH7-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>From <placeName corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</placeName> the Prince and his suite departed by special train for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, and then to Sarnia, the westernmost terminus of the Grand Trunk Railway.<ref target="#CH7-n23">23</ref> The Prince was greeted at the Sarnia railway station by a crowd of about 4,000, among whom were a group of about 150-200 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>ns from the Chippewa tribe, including the Chief, <persName>Kanwagashi,</persName> who
               presented an address to the Prince in his native language. At the end of each sentence the Prince heard a translation, which "reminded the Prince
               that the sky was beautiful, and that it was preordained that <persName>Albert Edward</persName> and Himself should meet and that his heart
               was glad of the event. He hoped the sky would continue fine for both those of the white and those of the red skin, and that His Royal Highness
               would remember the red man when he came to the throne." The Prince replied that "he was grateful for the address, and hoped the sky would
               continue beautiful. He would never forget his red brethren."<ref target="#CH7-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After the addresses were given, the Prince presented each of the chiefs with a large silver medal in commemoration of the visit. There appears to
               have been some confusion among the popular press about <pb n="111"/> these medals, as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent wrote that
               he "was told that they had been struck at the close of the last century for distribution among the chiefs of the tribes who had most
               distinguished themselves in the war against the Americans. From some cause or another they were never given, but remained 'in store' till the
               arrival of His Royal Highness, when the matter was recollected by some one or other, and they were once more brought out, furbished out, and
               re-chased with the coronet of the Prince of Wales....As a rule the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>ns prize their medals
               beyond anything, and I saw several who cherished as priceless heir-looms the medals their forefathers had earned in the War of Independence."<ref target="#CH7-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Cornwallis,</persName> who was associated with the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Herald</hi>, described the actual presentation when he wrote</p>
            <q>The chiefs, in addition to being ring-nosed, painted, and moccasined, had buffalo horns on their heads, and snake skins around their waists,
               thickly set with porcupine quills or colored grass. To these His Royal Highness presented medals as large as the mouth of a tumbler, while to the
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>ns of lower rank he gave medals of smaller size, and these bore the likeness of the
               Queen on one side and the royal arms on the reverse. The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>ns felt flattered, and returned
               the compliment by giving him a present of tomahawks, wampums, pipes, bows and arrows, and bark work.<ref target="#CH7-n26">26</ref>

            <p>Three sizes of silver medals were presented, 3 inch, 2 3/8 inch, and 1 1/2 inch, and the distribution correlated size with rank. Despite reports
               from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, the medals presented do not date from the eighteenth century and with at least one exception bear the
               effigy of Victoria. Originally issued in 1840, they are distinguished by the Prince of Wales's plumes and the date 1860 to the left and right of
               the Queen's bust. The two larger medals carry the Queen's title VICTORIA DEI GRATIA BRITANNIARUM REGINA F: D:; on the smaller size the legend is
               somewhat abbreviated. In addition, it should be noted that the <persName>W.W.C. Wilson</persName> sale featured a 3 inch George III <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>n Peace Medal, dated 1814, which bears, to the right of the king's bust, the engraved <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> plumes and the date 1860.<ref target="#CH7-n27">27</ref> This specimen is now in the cabinet of the
               American Numismatic Society. Jamieson mentions that the Prince distributed these medals at the various gatherings of tribes throughout <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.<ref target="#CH7-n28">28</ref> However, although both the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>
               and <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> correspondents report meetings between the Prince and Indians of many tribes on different occasions, they only
               mention distribution of medals on the one occasion already discussed. Ad- <pb n="112"/> ditional research utilizing contemporary records might
               provide the evidence necessary to determine under what circumstances medals were presented.</p>
            <p>The next stop of consequence for the Prince was <placeName>Niagara Falls</placeName> where he was entertained by the renowned aerialist <persName>Jean François Gravelet,</persName> better known as <persName>Charles Blondin.</persName> During the exhibition <persName>Blondin</persName> crossed the rapids on a tightrope with a man on his back, and offered to take the Prince across in a similar
               manner, but the offer was politely declined.<ref target="#CH7-n29">29</ref> It might be of interest to note that Blondin was not alone in the
               ability to cross the Falls on a tightrope. Prior to viewing <persName>Blondin's</persName> performance, the Prince happened to notice a
               similar feat by Farini.<ref target="#CH7-n30">30</ref> However, today we only remember <persName>Blondin,</persName> and, not surprisingly,
               we find that only he is depicted on a medal, struck in white metal, 35 mm in diameter, portraying Blondin on the obverse and a view of his
               crossing over the Falls by tightrope on the reverse. The inscription reads, on the obverse, <persName>BLONDIN</persName>/THE HERO OF <placeName>NIAGARA,</placeName> and on the reverse, CROSSED THE FALLS OF <placeName>NIAGARA</placeName>/IN PRESENCE OF/H.R.H. PRINCE OF
               WALES/SEPR 1/1860.<ref target="#CH7-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the medals already mentioned, most of which relate to specific events during the tour, a number of medals exist which represent a
               portion of the charities distributed by the Prince. During the course of his travels, <persName>Albert Edward</persName> visited a number of
               schools, and donated money to be used for medals which could be distributed as prizes. Although generally catalogued as school awards, they
               should be thought of as royal charities, and as lasting memorials of the royal tour.</p>
            <p>In a letter dated September 17, 1860, the <placeName>Duke of Newcastle,</placeName> who accompanied the Prince, wrote to the Governor General,
                  <persName>Sir Edmund</persName> Head: <q>I have the pleasure of informing you that the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> has
                  placed in your account at the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, a sum of money, which His Royal Highness
                  requests you to be so good as to distribute to the institutions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> named in the
                  following schedule, in the sums placed opposite to each, as some token of the very great gratification which His Royal Highness has derived
                  from the interesting visit which is now nearly completed, and as proof of the deep interest which he must always take in the future progress
                  of this magnificent Province. His Royal Highness wishes that the sums appropriated to each should be applied in the distribution to the
                  students in such a way as may be suggested by the governing body <pb n="113"/> as the most conducive to the interests of the institutions,
                  subject in each case to your approval.<ref target="#CH7-n32">32</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>At least four medals have been issued which directly reflect the Prince's generosity: those for <persName>McGill</persName> University;
               Bishop's College; Victoria College; and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> Normal Schools.</p>
            <p>On September 30, 1860, the Prince departed <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> for an unofficial tour of the <placeName>United States</placeName>,<ref target="#CH7-n33">33</ref> which was marked by a 30 mm medal by <persName>Joseph H.
                  Merriam</persName> of <placeName>Boston.</placeName> After enjoying several days shooting on the prairies of the midwest, the Prince travelled,
               as "Baron Renfrew," east from St. <persName>Louis</persName>, stopping at many of the major cities along the way.<ref target="#CH7-n34">34</ref> Of all the stops on the royal progress, the visit to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> was
               the most spectacular. A grand ball organized in honor of the Prince began most inauspiciously when the floor collapsed. Fortunately, no one was
               seriously injured, and many of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>'s social elite were given an opportunity
               to display their finery, which <persName>Mr. Howard</persName> of the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Times</hi> described in excruciating detail: <q>
                  <persName>Mrs. Gov. Morgan</persName> wore a dress of white silk, elegantly trimmed and clouded with flounces of black lace, and lighted
                  up with diamonds as became her matronly rank...Mrs. Dr. Alex Mott of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>,
                  wore a white silk, trimmed with quillings of shaded violet, extending up the left side of the skirt to the corsage. A sentimental and yet
                  intellectual style of beauty.<ref target="#CH7-n35">35</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Times</hi> also reported that</p>
            <q>One lady, indeed, startled the Prince into expressing opinions, by regretting for him the unhappy fate which had compelled him to travel through
               the <placeName>United States</placeName> without sharing in a railway accident, and by explaining to him that if American ladies lay aside
               their bouquets when they waltz, it is from their considerate anxiety "not to tickle their partner's ears."<ref target="#CH7-n36">36</ref>
            </q>
            <p>The following day the Prince did some sightseeing, which included visits to <persName>Brady's</persName> Gallery, where a number of
               photographs were taken, and to <persName>Mr. Bamum's</persName> museum.<ref target="#CH7-n37">37</ref> In the evening a magnificent
               fireman's torchlight parade was held along a rather strange route, so that Fourteenth Street was transversed three times. A small medal is
               perhaps the only reminder today of this brilliant event. As the Prince stood on the balcony of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, he viewed the procession
               of 5,000 firemen, along with their engines and other apparatus: <q>Hour after hour, mile after mile, the gorgeous phalanx <pb n="114"/> wound its
                  slow length along, suffusing the sky with the lurid glare of rockets, snakes, Prince's plumes, and much beside, and dazzling the eyes of the
                  half million that beheld it with the blaze of Drummond lights, here and there softened by the mellow tints of variegated lanterns.<ref target="#CH7-n38">38</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Overall, the Prince's visit can only be termed a resounding success. Most importantly, coming at a time when the function of the British monarchy
               was undergoing radical change from political activism to one of seeming impartiality, symbolizing the nation and above politics, the monarchy
               needed to redefine its role. Had the Prince's tour been a failure, it is questionable whether the monarchy would have developed as it has into a
               major media event or even whether it would have survived the turmoils which have toppled similar institutions. However, the tour did prove a
               success, and became a precedent for the many subsequent tours which have brought the British monarchy into contact with its territories and
               colonies.</p>
            <p>One aspect of the Prince's tour has special significance for the American Numismatic Society, and deserves special recognition. Although no
               medals were issued by the Society to mark the Prince's visit to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, the ANS did not pass up the
               opportunity to do so when his grandson <persName>Edward</persName> visited this country as <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> in
               1919. In honor of that visit, the ANS struck a medal designed by John Flanagan. On November 18, 1919, during a ceremony aboard the <hi rend="italic">HMS Renown</hi>, the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> received a gold specimen of the medal housed in a wooden case
               made from a tree planted by his grandfather on October 12, 1860, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>'s
               Central Park.<ref target="#CH7-n39">39</ref>

            <p>This paper discusses patterns and trial pieces of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> including those of the former
               colonies of <placeName>New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,</placeName> Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>,
               British <placeName corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</placeName> and <placeName>Newfoundland.</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>Given the great rarity of the vast majority of Canadian patterns and trial pieces, it is not surprising that they are seldom encountered by
               numismatists. Several pieces found only in the British Royal Mint collection or the National Currency Collection, Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> are believed to be unique.</p>
            <p>This paper presents only patterns and trials that were examined by this writer and includes some previously unpublished pieces. Patterns and
               trials contained in the R. Henry <persName>Norweb</persName> Collection, as well as those of the American Numismatic Society, National
               Currency Collection, Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and the British Royal Mint were examined and
               recorded.</p>

               <p>In <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName>, a piece is considered a pattern if it bears a proposed new design,
                  denomination, or metal that is not adopted for currency use during the year it was produced. However, in <placeName>Great
                     Britain</placeName>, a piece bearing the adopted design but dated earlier than the currency issue is termed a "proof." The term "proof' also
                  applies to off-metal strikes of the adopted design.</p>
               <p>Trial strikes are pieces produced at any stage of the preparation of a die allowing the designer or engraver to have a threedimensional
                  representation of the piece. They are rarely struck in precious metal and are meant only for internal use. Trial pieces always display the
                  adopted design but may differ in shape, finish, metal or have the addition or deletion of a mint mark. Some trial strikes occur only as proofs
                  or specimens.</p>
               <p>The first major article dealing with Canadian patterns appeared in 1908.<ref target="#CH8-n1">1</ref> Written by one of <placeName>Canada's</placeName> leading numismatists, <persName corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</persName>, the article listed and described

                  article on Canadian patterns in 1957,<ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref> listing 43 pieces illustrated mostly with line drawings. The most

               </head>
               <p>The Currency Act of 1910 provided for a silver dollar, and the Mint in <placeName>Ottawa</placeName> acquired a new coining press capable
                  of striking the large-sized silver dollar. The matrix for the silver dollar was produced in 1910.<ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref> However, the
                  death of <persName>King Edward VII</persName> in May of that year resulted in a delay in producing the matrix and punches bearing <persName>Bertram MacKennal's</persName> portrait of <persName>King George V.</persName> The original obverse punch produced on July
                  21, 1911, was the "Godless" one omitting the DEI GRA: in the legend.<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> In October 1911, a new matrix was cut
                  bearing the corrected legend (see Appendix A). A letter dated December 11, 1911, confirms that the newly elected Canadian government did not
                  approve the production of the dollar (see Appendix B). There are two known patterns in silver along with a lead trial striking. The 1911
                  pattern dollar is probably the bestknown of all the Canadian patterns.</p>
