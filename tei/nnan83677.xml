            <p>It seems strange that no comprehensive effort to arrange the di-staters of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> has ever been published.<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Perhaps the vast number of the varieties of the didrachms is a deterrent sufficient to explain why they have not been given the attention they deserve, but this condition does not apply to the larger denomination. The old and mistaken idea that pieces from identical dies are seldom found may have militated against a serious study of these pieces but the lack of a record of any considerable hoard within recent times is a more significant explanation. The present examination was begun with a view to finding where these tetradrachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> parallel the single issue of di-staters at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</placeName>. These Metapontine double-units are commonly accepted as having been struck during the period of not more than four years during which <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_epirus">Epirus</placeName> played a leading role in the history of south <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>. The establishment of a
<pb n="2"/>
synchronism between the two series should permit working both forward and backward from that point and be of value in showing the evolution of each city's coinage.</p>
            <p>Another deterrent which might have acted to prevent an earlier study of these Thurian coins is the slightness of the change in the type and the frequent absence of distinguishing symbols. There is stylistic evidence that the issue of these di-staters was not continuous and it was therefore problematical whether there would be any help from die-mulings. Any attempt to solve the problem depended upon having the majority of the pieces known, together with their weights. The measure with which this condition has been met is due to cooperation which I am glad to acknowledge on the part of the more important national collections of Europe and of those private collectors whose names are cited in the lists which follow, all of whom have been very prompt in responding to my request for casts. To all who have aided, I render cordial thanks.</p>
            <p>In his earlier study of the weights of the <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> colonies of southern <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, the late <persName>Dr. Regling</persName> brought together data concerning 138 Thurian di-staters.<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> He observed an upward trend in weight toward the end of the series and just before the reduction in the standard. <persName>Dr. Regling</persName>'s observations were founded on a representative group of these di-staters—or those for which the weights were
<pb n="3"/>
easily obtainable, including those in the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> cabinet at that time and such others as had been listed in previously published catalogues. No claim to conclusiveness was made. The number cited by <persName>Dr. Regling</persName> is herein increased to 322, although the weights of certain pieces (12 in number) are lacking.<ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> This number however, with the added notation that it comprises some 111 varieties (each die combination being considered a variety), is the first and a rather startling point to be considered. That there are so many varieties (42) with a single specimen known and twenty-three of which two specimens only have been discovered by careful searching, presents further food for thought, especially when the probability that there are varieties which have not survived is remembered. Other phenomena which have appeared were scarcely to have been anticipated.</p>
            <p>A word regarding the convention used for numbering and that employed to indicate identity of dies will be necessary. The capital letters A to N (with the exception of I) indicate the groups into which the di-staters are divided. Thus in Group A there is a single variety—in Group D, nine (with D20, possibly ten). Each die combination is given a separate number and these numbers in every case are even numbers. By this means new varieties and new die combinations can later be interpolated and
<pb n="4"/>
given intermediate numbers without necessitating an entire renumeration. The chronological placement of an addition will be indicated by the group letter. The condition that an odd number is used will be an indication that it is new to the present arrangement.</p>
            <p>An examination of the plates will show straight lines between certain of the coins illustrated. These are intended to show visually that the dies so connected are identical. On Plate I the demonstration is simple because there are few dies to each group and even with numbers C2a and C2b where two specimens sharing <hi rend="italic">both</hi> dies are shown, the intention is plain. In Group F, however, where there are twenty-two distinct varieties and here, where the mulings are fairly complicated, the convention is not so satisfactory. To indicate identity of dies that are widely separated, the numbers of the connecting dies are given below in italics at the end of a short line rather than by a line which might have to cross from one end of the plate to the other.<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> This is the only group in which confusion need be anticipated, but the descriptions will satisfy doubts should any arise.</p>
            <p>In the coin descriptions the objective has been clarity and brevity. Essential differences are cited—frequently more than a single one and preferably one not likely to be off-flan or ambiguous. Occasionally as in Group G this is exceedingly difficult, especially
<pb n="5"/>
with the reverses, where the inscriptions provide the easiest means of testing differences. The known specimens are listed under each variety with the usual indication for the <placeName>Berlin</placeName>
               <hi rend="italic">Münzkabinett</hi> as <placeName>Berlin</placeName> etc., and with easily traceable references to the auction catalogues, such as <persName>Naville</persName> V or Strozzi, which scarcely require elucidation.</p>
            <p>Of three hundred and seven specimens for which the weights have been obtained five have unusually low weights (B2n, H22, K12b, Kl2c, L4c,). The possibility of error in recording these weights is sufficient to warrant eliminating them from a frequency table. We have recorded 302 coins and from these the table was prepared. The greatest number of pieces falls between the weights 15.65 and 15.85. The norm according to this determination is therefore 15.75. The average weight of these 302 pieces is 15.374. The highest weights, that is those in the last two divisions, are predominantly of the later issues. For the weights between 15.95 and 16.04 seven out of ten fall after group G, to which I have assigned a date c.330. In the next group (16.05 to 16.14) all four specimens are of these later issues. This supports <persName>Dr. Regling</persName>'s observation concerning an 'upward trend' in weight. It is hardly strong enough to warrant the suggestion of a change in the weight standard, however.</p>
            <p>It should be added that the American Numismatic Society will be grateful for further additions to the specimens here cited—in all cases the weights are desired. Preferably, wherever possible a cast or
<pb n="6"/>
sealing wax impression should be sent, unless the piece is one which has appeared in an auction catalogue or is illustrated photographically elsewhere, in which case a statement to that effect alone is needed. The present ownership of pieces herein listed according to the sales from which they have come, is also desirable. It would be helpful, whenever a specimen is known to have come from a hoard, to have that circumstance mentioned.</p>

               <p>The founding of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> in 443 would give a fixed point for the city's coinage, if we could be sure that its coinage began immediately. <persName>Jörgensen</persName> in his excellent article<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> that during the first twenty years of its existence its coinage was very scanty. <persName>Jörgensen</persName> terminates the issue having the helmet of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> ornamented with an olive wreath in 425—that is, in the first eighteen years of the city's existence. All of this would be foreign to a study of the di-staters, since we have a single specimen bearing the olive wreath, if it did not bear upon the dating of the B group which follows, in which the <persName>Scylla</persName> adorning <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>'s helmet replaces the wreath, and which, because the letter Φ is common to the obverses of both varieties of the didrachms can be shown to follow immediately after the introduction of the <persName>Scylla</persName> decoration.</p>
               <pb n="7"/>
               <p>The use of the olive in connection with <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> requires no comment. As much can hardly be said for the figure of <persName>Scylla</persName>. That it should have been introduced without a significance which would be apparent to the Greeks is foreign to all we know concerning their use of decorative symbols.<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref> That the use of this figure persisted so long after its introduction further strengthens the position that it had especial significance. It would not be unusual for such a striking change in the coin type to have taken place because of some important event in the history of the city. We must, therefore, glance back to the scanty records. Because they do not bear on our problem, we may here eliminate a discussion of the voluminous references to the foundation of the city and to the part played by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> in the founding of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_lucaniae">Heraclea</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Apparently <persName>Jörgensen</persName>'s dating for the series having <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>'s helmet adorned with the olive wreath is, as has been noted, a swing to the other extreme
<pb n="8"/>
from the position taken in the first edition of the Historia Numorum—modified in the second edition, possibly because of <persName>Jörgensen</persName>'s arguments. Why 425 was chosen by <persName>Jörgensen</persName> as the date for the change to the <persName>Scylla</persName> type is not made clear—or rather, it is admitted to have been arbitrary.<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> Except when applied over long periods of time, deductions based on the comparative number of dies used are of questionable value. This is because of the variable or unknown elements—the life of a die, possible intervals between strikings, and the increased requirements in time of war. But when we find a large number of varieties in the wreathed helmet series during a period in which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> is generally at peace, we may question that all these issues could have been crowded into a space of eighteen years as <persName>Jörgensen</persName> proposes.</p>
               <p>The change which took place when the <persName>Scylla</persName> replaced the wreath of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>'s helmet has one element of significance; it is a change <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the type adopted when the influence of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was predominant. Furthermore, the <persName>Scylla</persName> type persisted after the defeat of the Athenians by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and for many decades. A glimpse at the record of that mighty struggle as given so impressively by <persName>Thucydides</persName> provides data that seem to have escaped <persName>Jörgensen</persName>'s notice, and this testimony is confirmed in some of its details by <persName>Diodorus</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n9">
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </ref> and in <persName>Plutarch</persName>'s biography of <persName>Alcibiades</persName>. We are told that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</placeName>
                  <pb n="9"/>
and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> contributed ships to the Athenian forces before <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> (<persName>Thucydides</persName> VII, lvii, 11). In the light of its foundation by colonists from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> this is not more than we should expect for the latter place. There is, however, a very illuminating addition by <persName>Thucydides</persName> who says of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> that both these cities were "reduced at this time to such straits by party crises that they could not do otherwise." But we are not dependent upon a single statement of <persName>Thucydides</persName> as sometimes happens; other confirmatory passages follow. When <persName>Alcibiades</persName> was recalled it was at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> that he abandoned the Salaminia, in whose company his vessel was returning, and from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> he fled to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName>. (<persName>Thucydides</persName> VI, lxi, 6, 7). In connection with the aid sent to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName> under the leadership of <persName>Gylippos</persName> we read that he endeavored to induce several of the South Italian cities to change sides. His hope to have accomplished this at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> was the stronger because his father had once been one of its citizens, but he failed to win them over. This failure is the more easily understood because the Athenian forces at this stage had suffered none of the reverses which later caused their downfall (<persName>Thucydides</persName>, VI, civ, 2).</p>
               <p>After the first reversals for the Athenians, in response to <persName>Nicias</persName>' appeal for further aid from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, reinforcements were sent under the leaders <persName>Demosthenes</persName> and <persName>Eurymedon</persName>. (<persName>Thucydides</persName> VII, xxxiii, 3–6). Concerning this force after it had reached <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, we read, "At <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thuria">Thuria</placeName> they found that
<pb n="10"/>
the faction opposed to the Athenians had recently been expelled in a revolution; and as they were desirous, after collecting their whole armament at that place, to hold a review of it, on the chance that anyone had been left behind, and also to persuade the Thurians both to take part with them in the expedition with all zeal and, in view of the Athenian's present good fortune, to regard the same persons foes and friends as the Athenians did, they waited at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thuria">Thuria</placeName> and dealt with these matters."<ref target="#CH1-n10">
                     <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                  </ref>
                  <persName>Thucydides</persName> does not tell us whether the Thurians were persuaded to join the Athenian forces. If they did so, the triumph of the anti-Athenian faction after the Athenian defeat would have been much easier. That there was such a readjustment is indicated by the later statement (<persName>Thucydides</persName> VIII, xxxv, 1) that <persName>Hippocrates</persName> the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Lacedaemonian</placeName> sailed from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</placeName> with ten Thurian ships under the command of <persName>Doreius</persName>, son of <persName>Diagoras</persName> and two colleagues during the same winter (i. e. 412–411).</p>
               <p>Does it not seem logical, therefore, to attribute the marked change in the type of the city's coinage to c. 413–410? In the <persName>Scylla</persName> we may see an apotro-paic motif featuring a native myth and replacing the form adopted when the Athenians were in power.</p>
               <p>To <persName>Mrs. A. Baldwin Brett</persName> I am indebted for pointing out that the signature of <persName>Phrygillos</persName> on the tetradrachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> is dated by <persName>Tudeer</persName>

to the time of the victory over the Athenians. The associated die by ΕϒΘ depicts a <hi rend="italic">winged</hi> charioteer, and singularly enough, shows a <persName>Scylla</persName> in the exergue. It would require a long digression to review the questions hinging upon the name of this artist in an attempt to determine whether Φ, ΦΡϒ and <persName>Phrygillos</persName> are the same individual and whether the bird on the Thurian staters is a finch and a punning-reference to the name of <persName>Phrygillos</persName>. The published material is admirably summarized by <persName>Tudeer</persName>, and significant specimens of the varieties involved are illustrated by <persName>Dr. Regling</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n12">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref>
                  <persName>Tudeer</persName>'s conclusion is that ΦΡϒ at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> is identical with <persName>Phrygillos</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. Since that is what most concerns us here, we may leave the other branches of this problem for later investigation of the rather complicated evidence.<ref target="#CH1-n13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref>
                  <persName>Tudeer</persName> also feels that the workmanship of <persName>Phrygillos</persName> on his signed die at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> shows that he must have been a stranger to the procedure at this mint. This leads him to conclude that his activity at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> preceded that at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>—a judgment the more valuable as support because of his <orgName type="ethnic">Syracusan</orgName> point of view.</p>
               <p>If the activity of <persName>Phrygillos</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> is to be dated prior to 413 and if it terminated there shortly after that date, since the change to the type having <persName>Scylla</persName> on <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>'s helmet occurs within the series having the bird—a group inseparably connected
<pb n="12"/>
with the ΦΡϒ coins, we have further support for our dating of this change to the time of the Athenian reverse.</p>

At <placeName>Cumae</placeName> and <placeName>Agrigentum</placeName>, <persName>Scylla</persName> provides a subsidiary type—at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and <placeName>Agrigentum</placeName>, it is relegated to the exergue.

               <p>The name of Histor occurs but once (B6) on these di-staters—in tiny letters along the exergual line.

                  </ref> has published reasons for identifying the letters ΙΣ on the observe die of a stater as the initials of Histor. His conclusions are accepted and amplified by <persName>Mr. E. S. G. Robinson</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n15">
                     <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                  </ref> On B6 on which the Histor signature occurs we have the monogram <graphic url="NNM71_016.jpg"/> on the bull's rump to the left of his tail. On the didrachm, there is a large letter Ε in addition to ΙΣ (in small letters), while on the reverse of a closely related stater (Pl. XI, 13) there is a tiny Ε on the rump of the bull. Since the monogram must be read Εϒ, <persName>Robinson</persName> points out that the acceptance of Histor as the artist involves accepting Ε and Εϒ as initials of a single individual who can hardly be other than a mint official or moneyer. He further submits that since the Ε above the peak of the helmet on the didrachm indicates a moneyer, the Φ on the di-stater B2 does not indicate the artist, but a moneyer, and that this die, because of similarities with B6 is also the work of Histor. This conclusion
<pb n="13"/>
is not logically inevitable, however, and it seems to fall down when subjected to the obvious test of comparing the obverses of B2 and B6. The style of Histor which is conspicuously noticeable in the didrachm with Ε is very different from that of the obverse die of B2, with its Φ. It is unnecessary to labor this point here, since the succession of Group B depends on the employment of the Φ in its position above the peak of the helmet and is independent of a determination whether that <hi rend="italic">phi</hi> indicates <persName>Phrygillos</persName> or someone else whose name begins with that letter who was moneyer at the time. One possibility is that <persName>Phrygillos</persName> was artist first and moneyer as well later. In the troubled times following 413 strict consistency with regard to signatures is hardly to be looked for with such a personal procedure.</p>
               <p>The didrachms offer very little help in the study of the di-staters. In fact, they rather provide support for the inconsistency of which we have been speaking. Although no pieces of the larger denomination have been found bearing the name of <persName>Molossos</persName>, the placing of his name on the staters offers analogies with the occurrence of Histor's 'signature.' In 1906, <persName>Dr. Regling</persName> shared von <persName>Sallet</persName>'s opinion<ref target="#CH1-n16">
                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                  </ref> that <persName>Molossos</persName> was a magistrate rather than an artist. Recently, however, in the entry under <persName>Molossos</persName> in Vol. XVI of the Pauly-Wissowa Real-encyclopädie, he accepts the interpretation proposed by <persName>Robinson</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n17">
                     <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                  </ref> that the inscription on a <hi rend="italic">plated</hi> coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName>,
<pb n="14"/>
reading 'ΜΟΛΟΣΣΟΣ ΕΠΟΕΙ' indicates <persName>Molossos</persName> is to be considered as the die-engraver. When two such scholars are in agreement, it seems hazardous to file a caveat. The chief objection is the workmanship on the dies which bear the name of <persName>Molossos</persName>. Of these I have found nineteen bearing the name of <persName>Molossos</persName> in full, and there are others having an initial M which may or may not indicate his name. But even with dies bearing his name, there is little uniformity. That on these nineteen issues we have good, bad and indifferent die-cutting within a demonstrably brief period seems support for deducing that <persName>Molossos</persName> was a magistrate rather than an 'artist.' Could one individual have done the same thing in so many different ways?</p>
               <p>Further support for this is to be found in the unique stater in <placeName>Berlin</placeName> which bears the name of ΝΙΚΑΝΔΡΟΣ in the same position as the name of <persName>Molossos</persName>. (Pl. XI, 7). Above the exergual line is a grasshopper. On the obverse, the <persName>Scylla</persName> holds a rudder and the flap of the helmet is decorated with a scroll. The crest has none of the worried treatment which characterizes the issues of Group G of the di-staters, where <persName>Scylla</persName> also holds a rudder, and it would seem to have preceded them by at least two decades and possibly more. The position of the bull's head is close to that found on the staters of <persName>Molossos</persName> and with the later issues of Group F of the di-staters. The letters of the <persName>Nikandros</persName> inscription are smaller than the largest of those of <persName>Molossos</persName>, but larger than most of the other <persName>Molossos</persName> inscriptions.
<pb n="15"/>
If <persName>Molossos</persName> proves to be a magistrate or moneyer, <persName>Nikandros</persName> with his single die must follow.</p>
               <p>An examination of the plates appended will provide evidence supporting that the issues of the Thurian di-staters cannot have been continuous. Within the groups into which these pieces have herein been divided, die-mulings are usual. Except for the first piece described, the varieties which do not have either their obverse or reverse dies participating in mulings is surprisingly small (23). There is room for some difference of opinion as to what comprises a group. The mere absence of connection, because for many die-combinations we have but a single specimen, should teach us to be wary, since such linkings may still come to light. When, however, there is a noticeable change of style separating two groups it is not unreasonable to deduce that there was an interval separating them.</p>
               <p>The breaks between the groups, which have been mentioned, logically claim our first attention. Turning first to the groups F and G, there are two striking differences in the G group which have not occurred previously, (a) the <persName>Scylla</persName> on the obverse holds a rudder; (b) the reverse shows two fishes in the exergue instead of the single occupant found in the earlier issues. This distinction throws together into the first division most of the di-staters having a single fish in the exergue.<ref target="#CH1-n18">

               <head>GROUP B (c. 412 B. C.)</head>
               <p>Turning to Plates I and II, a distinction is at once apparent. The head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> is to the r. on the series shown on Plate I—to the left on Plate II. Further, except for the first coin and C2, all of the pieces on Plate I show a griffin facing to the right on the flap of the helmet; on Pl. II this griffin is no longer seen. The latest series of the staters with the wreathed helmet as well as the first of those with the <persName>Scylla</persName> bear the distinguishing letter <hi rend="italic">phi</hi> in the field in front of the <persName>Scylla</persName>; and this is found in one of the obverse dies of the B group, thus placing them. The lowered head of the bull in the pieces in Group B is seen to be in profile; in Group C and in the pieces of the following Group shown on Plate II (except for D2) the bull's head is turned so as to be partly facing. The exception noted, D2, found in a single specimen in the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> cabinet, shares its obverse die with reverses showing the bull's head facing, and is therefore to be interpreted as the link connecting the groups occupying these two plates. It may seem that a separation of the Group B and C is unnecessary; changes in the head of the bull and in the exergual line are the chief differences.</p>
               <p>A word regarding C2a might be interpolated at this point. This coin is known to me in a cast only, but <persName>M. Babelon</persName> tells me in a letter that there is not the slightest reason to doubt its genuineness. It
<pb n="17"/>
will be seen that it shares both obverse and reverse dies with C2b although there is no <persName>Scylla</persName> on the helmet of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>. The most satisfactory explanation is that we have a coin struck from a die that was still unfinished—what might be called a trial-piece. If such is the case, this is the only specimen of a <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> coin from incomplete dies known to me. As an indication of the manner of die-cutting it should be very important. The figure of the griffin, like that of the <persName>Scylla</persName>, is made a separate problem and the locks of hair are modified in C2b to correlate the elements of the whole.</p>

               <head>GROUP D</head>
               <p>As has already been pointed out, this group shares with the succeeding one (E) the distinction of having all the obverse heads facing to the left; except for two further dies, F2 and F12–14, the heads on the Thurian di-staters all face to the right.<ref target="#CH1-n19">
                     <hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                  </ref> There are nine, possibly ten varieties, but there are in all only three obverse dies. Each obverse die is combined with three reverses—with the last, there are possibly four combinations. That the initial die precedes D8 is to be seen from the reverse die of D6, which is an earlier stage of the same die found in D8—the die-crack which runs from the ϒ of the ethnic to the
<pb n="18"/>
back of the bull is not present in D6. The reverses of D4 and D10 are also seen to be identical. The obverse die for Nos. D12–18 shares none of its reverses with any of the varieties which precede it on the plate, nor is its connection with E2 strikingly close. It seems very improbable that this reverse would precede that of D2, however, and the ordering submitted finds support in the slightly less effective treatment of the hair of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>, which shows some of the simplification to be seen in the single obverse die of Group E.</p>
               <p>D2 calls for comment because of the position of the bull, which is apparently a derivative of much earlier issues of the staters. For this reason, one would expect to find it much nearer to A2, but the combination of its obverse die with the other reverses on this plate leaves no room for its placement earlier. The use of the letter delta below the crest should be noted; the position of the left hand of the <persName>Scylla</persName> in all three obverse dies is also distinctive. Like its immediate predecessor, the obverse die for D8–12 is very beautiful. It is shown in three stages; the break which is not prominent in D10 has developed until a considerable segment of the surface is gone in D12. The relief is perhaps not quite so high as in the preceding groups, but the workmanship has rarely been surpassed.</p>
               <p>D20 is a puzzling coin which it is difficult to judge from the reproduction. Although my suspicions may prove unwarranted, it seemed best to reproduce it here in the text, partly because I could not obtain
<pb n="19"/>
a cast of it. The head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> shows signs of tooling and the inscription is very different from that of other dies muled with this obverse. The weight does not indicate plating but this is also a possibility.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-2">

               </figure>
               <p>The group labelled E is so small that there is room for thinking that a connection with the preceding group may yet come to light. There is a fairly obvious falling off in style as well as such notable differences as the turning of the bull to the I. on the reverses of E4 and E6 and the placing of the tuft of the bull's tail above his back rather than across the flank, which is characteristic of certain dies in the D group—cf. D6, D8 and D18. D12 which seems to provide an exception to this suggestion is struck from a badly broken die which would hardly have been used except in an emergency—that is, a die which would have been rejected in normal times. The reverse, too, may be an old die which had been laid aside before it had worn out. E4 and E6, in harking back to the placing of the bull's tail across the flank, indicate a closer connection with group D than with group F and give ground for considering
<pb n="20"/>
E2 as following rather than preceding these two combinations of dies.</p>

One of these pieces from <persName>Mr. Newell</persName>'s collection is illustrated on Pl. XI, No. 6. I believe it is unpublished. It is apparently closest to F12 of the di-staters.</p>

               <head>GROUP F</head>
               <p>The seven pieces placed at the beginning of this division were at first considered a separate group, but double mulings with later issues showed that the group, though large, was a single one. The die-mulings claim priority of attention. In two instances we have a reverse die connected with three obverses (a. F2, F8 and F18; b. F34, F40, F44). There are five instances where two reverse dies are combined with the same obverse; one in which there are four reverses with the same obverse die and another case in which no less than six different reverse dies are found with the same obverse. There is a possibility, one might say probability, that further combinations will be found. With some of these combinations, all of the specimens located are in poor condition and consequently there is room for a difference of opinion as to which is the earlier state of the die. It follows that further specimens may reverse or change the order here submitted.</p>
               <p>Throughout the group the <persName>Scylla</persName> on the helmet is shown with hand upraised to her brow in a scanning or peering attitude. Three of the nine obverse dies have letters between the neckpiece of the helmet and the crest (ΔΙ diagonally downward or retrograde). F2 and F12–14 are the only varieties with <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>'s head to the left; on F2 the annulet between the neckpiece and the crest may be intended for a
<pb n="21"/>
theta. The varieties F4–F10 show an obverse die which is seldom in good condition. This die bears a symbol for which I can find no previous publication. On the bowl of the helmet, between the shoulder of <persName>Scylla</persName> and the base of the crest, a tiny skyphos or kotyle is to be seen on fine specimens. Possibly this is an instance of a use of the punning principle to which <persName>Dr. Macdonald</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n20">
                     <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
                  </ref> has called attention and is to be recognized as a <hi rend="italic">type parlant</hi> for an artist's signature. Alternative suggestions are not abundant.</p>
               <p>The distinguishing of the reverse varieties is very difficult because the differences are slight. If the present arrangement proves stable, it would seem that the bull's head three-quarters facing was changed to a profile position. The exergue is uniformly occupied by a single fish; the exergual line is sometimes continuous, sometimes dotted and sometimes double—that is having a continuous as well as a dotted line. In the die F10–12 there are small pellets above the exergual line. Their significance is not clear. The treatment of the ethnic is varied but slightly—the relative spacing of the letters frequently provides the chief means of distinguishing varieties.</p>
               <p>The workmanship throughout this large series is uniformly good without being of exceptional quality. There is a tendency towards lowering the relief and occasionally the result, as in F32–34, is unpleasing. Broken dies are helpful (the reverse of F12 and the
<pb n="22"/>
obverse of F40 for example). Note also the obverse of F30 and the reverses of F22 and F24. Double-striking frequently complicates identifications. The evidence, however, hardly warrants our describing the minting as hurried.</p>

               <p>As has been pointed out the difference between Groups A-E and those which follow are basic and divide the di-staters into two groups. A repetition for emphasis will, I trust, be pardoned. There are two distinguishing marks to separate groups A to E from those which follow, as well as an appreciable difference in style: (1) the exergue of the reverse now contains two fishes instead of one; (2) in Groups G and H the <persName>Scylla</persName> is seen to be holding a rudder and a trident, respectively. The workmanship is coarser and less careful as may be observed in the crest particularly, but also in the hair treatment and in the modelling of the bull. The coin-flans are seldom sufficiently broad to show the entire surface of the dies. The helmet-crest is frequently incomplete and often either the ethnic or the fishes in the exergue of the reverse fail to show satisfactorily. The inscription, too, is significant; it drops at the end and since this neither follows the curve of the edge of the die nor repeats the line of the back of the charging bull, it weakens the design.</p>

               <head>GROUP G (c. 333 B. C.)</head>
               <p>Group G is exceptional because of its small size. So far as we now know, the group consists of one obverse die combined with four reverses. The racing torch which appears on the reverse above the bull is later found as an exergual symbol. The single obverse die, however, is much more significant. On the neckpiece of the helmet there is recurrence of the griffin seen earlier in Groups B and C. Behind the neck appear the letters I Π. As has been mentioned, the <persName>Scylla</persName> now holds a rudder. In addition, behind the head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> and sometimes entirely off flan, we find a tiny Nike with a taenia or a wreath held aloft in front of her.</p>
               <p>The first question is "what event in history is likely to have called forth the use of such a symbol?" After the catastrophe of 387 B. C., when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</placeName> was destroyed and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_croton">Croton</placeName> punished by <persName corresp="#nomisma_dionysios_byzantium">Dionysius</persName>, victories were not so common at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> that we may lose count of them. The troubled condition of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> after the death of <persName>Archytas</persName> in 345 is common knowledge. The scanty records give us slight hint of anything that can be called a victory until <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> of <persName>Molossos</persName> had arrived on the scene. The style of these pieces is not at variance with what we should expect for 334–332. The issue was a brief one—only one obverse die seems to have been needed.</p>

strate that the single issue of di-staters at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</placeName> occurred during the ascendency of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. The reasons are: (1) The name of the same magistrate, AMI, occurs on a stater having the thunderbolt symbol of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> (Pl. XI, 12) and also on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of the di-staters (Pl. XI, 11); (2) The period during which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> were united under the command of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> is the logical one in which to place <placeName corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</placeName>'s single issue of this denomination. There are additional reasons, but what most concerns us here is that the Metapontine coin shows the bowl of the Corinthian helmet worn by <persName>Leukippos</persName> ornamented by the figure of Nike driving a quadriga while at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> we have the figure of Nike. In these coins on which Nike figures, may we not see a reference to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s successes, one of which, according to <persName>Livy</persName>, was the recapture of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_lucaniae">Heraclea</placeName> from the Lucanians? The scantiness of the issue would Be an indication that it was initiated shortly before <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s death, which would be the reason for its ending.</p>
               <p>In the initial arrangement of these di-staters of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName>, these Nike pieces of Group G were placed after Group H. One reason for this was the letters Εϒ on G2 which might have indicated a connection with H28 and H30 where ΕϒΘ occurs on the flap of the helmet. Through <persName>Dr. Regling</persName>'s kindness, I received the cast of the stater in the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> cabinet (Pl. XI, 8) which shows a racing torch on the reverse above the back of the bull just as it occurs on the di-stater and I Π replacing the griffin on the neckpiece
<pb n="25"/>
of the helmet instead of in the space between the crest and the neck. Although there are other staters showing <persName>Scylla</persName> holding a rudder which may possibly have some connection with this group, their testimony is not free from equivocation. In marked contrast with the small size of Group G and the rarity of staters which are similar, the stater issue which parallels Group H is exceptionally large. In place of the rudder held by <persName>Scylla</persName> we find a trident, while on the reverse there are added symbols, letters and monograms, notably ΣΩ and ΣΩΓ as well as <graphic url="NNM71_029a.jpg"/>. If the ΣΩ issues (cf. Pl. XI, 9) are conceded to have come toward the end of this group as is shown by the di-staters, a comparison with the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> I Π stater shows its unmistakably earlier style. It must therefore be the earlier issue, and Group G must precede Group H.</p>

               <p>The order shown is dictated by the circumstance that the latest pieces have inscriptions and symbols on both dies, while the earlier have none. The letter pi (Π) makes its appearance on the reverse of H12 and 14 giving place to <graphic url="NNM71_029b.jpg"/> on H16.

To add further to the difficulties of interpretation, another bird appears between the forelegs of the bull on the reverse—possibly a duck. The owl must be without connection with either of the two names since it occurs impartially with each of them.

               <head>GROUPS J AND FOLLOWING</head>
               <p>Any arrangement of the groups following H is open to grave exceptions. An examination will show a radical change of style. The large head in bold relief with the wide-crested helmet of groups F and G gives place to a much smaller head occupying the center of the flan rather than filling it or running over its edge as it did formerly. With reference to the head, the relief is weak and mincing. On the reverse the bull is frequently so bad as to seem caricatured. Even when the composition as a whole is impressive at first glance, a close examination reveals slovenliness and lack of care. In consequence, the arrangement submitted is a tentative one—merely a working basis. It is supported by reasoning which may have to be modified with the discovery of the first hoard containing these pieces. The homogenity of the groups should perhaps first be established.</p>
               <p>Group J is held together by the presence of the letters ΕϒΦΑ, and almost by these alone. There are seventeen varieties, ten of these have two fishes in the exergue as is the case in the preceding group—the remaining seven have a thyrsus. In two of the obverse dies, the <persName>Scylla</persName> is holding a trident as in group G. In a discarded arrangement this was seen as a reason for beginning a new series of these pieces, but the continuation of the exergual convention (two fishes) seems a stronger warrant for the present sequence. On the remaining fifteen varieties (8? dies) the <persName>Scylla</persName> is hurling a rock (J26) or a squid (?).</p>
               <pb n="28"/>
               <p>The degeneration in style is nowhere more apparent than in the modeling of the <persName>Scylla</persName>, although the change in the treatment of the hair is also noteworthy. With a few exceptions (J22 and 24, and later in some but not all of the N group), the hair is not tied in a knot below the neck as in group H but spread out in loose tresses in a manner not used previously. The treatment of the exergual line, even within the groups, is not consistent—witness the mannered form of Nos. J30–34.</p>
               <p>ΕϒΦΑ[Ν] is probably a magistrate,<ref target="#CH1-n24">
                     <hi rend="sup">24</hi>
                  </ref> and is possibly, but far from certainly, to be recognized in the Εϒ to be seen beneath the bull on H2. The torch which appears above the bull in the H group is found also in the exergue of group L. The fifth letter of this name is supplied on the diobol illustrated on Pl. XI, No. 5.<ref target="#CH1-n25">
                     <hi rend="sup">25</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Of the relative order of groups M and N we may be certain because of the sequence M12–M14–N2–N4. The obverse die is in an earlier stage in M12. Group K is placed before L because we should ordinarily assume that a two-letter form of a name preceded a three-letter form, but there are enough objections to make the alternative plausible. Not only may group L precede group K but reasons may be presented for thinking that both K and L precede group J, although this is not so strong a probability since the continued use of two fishes in the
<pb n="29"/>
exergue, which characterized Group G, supports the present placing.</p>
               <p>Turning to the L group it will be seen that there are five variations of the reverse which share three obverse dies. One of these reverse dies has a single fish in the exergue—this is true also of the last four die combinations of group K, and is the basis of the present sequence. The other four reverse dies show a racing-torch in the exergue. This symbol also occurs on K4 between the hind legs of the bull as well as in group H above the back of the bull. It may be that an alternative to the present arrangement should be preferred—G8, L4–6–8–10–2, K12–14–16–18, K4 to 10 and K2 at the end of the group, which would be followed by group J in practically its present order. The style of the obverse head in the L group is fully as good (or as bad) as that found in group J, while the modelling of the bull is perhaps a little better than in many of the J dies. The presence of the letters ΣΙΜ is the one condition which holds the group together. The dolphin below the crest of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> on the obverse die of L2 has a single parallel in the introduction of an owl in the same place in H26 to 30. One reason for placing the L group in its present position is the evolution of the exergual line on the reverse—compare LIO and M2. The uninterrupted use of the rock-hurling <persName>Scylla</persName> is further support but neither has impressive value.</p>
               <p>The K group is closely connected with the L group by reason of the letters ΣΙ and ΣΙΜ which are pre-
<pb n="30"/>
sumably the initials of the same magistrate's name. There are nine die-combinations in the group. K2 is in a class by itself; ΣΙ occurs on the obverse and an aphlaston appears below the chin of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>. What meaning should be given the NI of K2's reverse, under the circumstances, provides food for conjecture. The coiled serpent in the exergue is unique among the di-staters—it occurs, similarly placed, on the staters.<ref target="#CH1-n26">
                     <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                  </ref> The exergue of the reverse provides a distinctive difference for the remaining eight varieties. Four show a tripod between two dolphins, and the remainder a single fish. It should be noted that the second group has the letter A behind the neck of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>. The torch between the hind legs of the bull of K4 has already been mentioned.</p>
               <p>The M group may be considered transitional. There are eight die combinations of which M12 and 14 mule with N2 and 4 as has already been noted.</p>
               <p>The homogenity of the group is indicated by the presence of the name ΕϒΦΡ, which is not to be confused with ΕϒΦΑ of group J. There is again a demonstration that the exergual symbol is not associated with the name since it changes from the flying owl for the first five varieties to the aegis in M12 to 16. Both of these are attributes of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> but the significance of their use is not apparent. With the exception of M2 (it weighs 14.39 and is possibly plated), all these coins are struck on a wide hammered flan, upon which the head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> is

well centered. M6 shows a <persName>Scylla</persName> holding a rudder (cf. group H), but on the other four varieties showing the <persName>Scylla</persName>, she is hurling a rock as in groups J, K, L and N10–16. On the last three varieties in group M, the <persName>Scylla</persName> is replaced by a running griffin such as has occurred previously on the flap of the helmet (cf. groups D, F and H). I have been unable to find a satisfying explanation for the occurrence of the griffin at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thurium">Thurium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_lucaniae">Heraclea</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n27">
                     <hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                  </ref> One is reminded that the griffin and the sphinx both of which occur earlier on the Thurian and Heraclean coinages, had a part in the decoration of the helmet of the <persName>Pheidian</persName>
                  <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> of the Parthenon, but their significance there also is not clear. In M4 and M10, the flying owl is holding a wreath and this seems to be the intention on all the specimens showing the owl in the exergue, although the wreath is frequently off flan. May we not interpret this as conveying that "in the magistracy of ΕϒΦΡ, through a plan revealed by <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>, a victory was achieved."<ref target="#CH1-n28">

There is some ground for placing N6 and N8 at the end of the group because of the exergual symbols and because the <persName>Scylla</persName> on the helmet is even a little worse than on the other varieties within the group. The exergual objects for these two pieces seem to be a throw-back to the earlier convention but again without any indication of the meaning. The branch in the exergue of N2 is promoted to the space above the bull in N4. <persName>Mr. Robinson</persName> has called my attention to the similarity in style between the pieces of this group, (especially M12), and certain of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_croton">Croton</placeName> coins having the head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_apollo_priene">Apollo</persName> on the obverse and a tripod on the reverse as well as the Metapontine type having <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q45967">Persephone</ref>'s head for obv. and the plough symbol on the reverse. This comparison is supported by the branch which appears on N2 and N4—the occurrence of similar branches on the series at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_croton">Croton</placeName> can hardly be without significance. Acceptance of this suggestion would involve revising the date assigned for the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_croton">Croton</placeName> pieces in <hi rend="italic">Historia Numorum,</hi> (370–330 B. C.). The other symbols, a lion's head to the right, cornucopiae and a racing torch (?) show almost the limit of variation possible but they can hardly have a connection with the name HPAK. The workmanship is sadly degenerate—witness the deplorable bull on N10.</p>

               <head>PLATED COINS</head>
               <p>That anything could be much worse than the workmanship shown in some of the pieces of Group N is hard to believe but a glance at the plated coins
<pb n="33"/>
with which Plate X is filled out demonstrates this possibility. The selection made is intended to be representative; accepting it as such a few deductions may be drawn.</p>
               <p>With some of these coins it is very difficult to be certain whether they are plated or not. One such is illustrated on Plate IV where it is given the number F46. The obverse will sustain a superficial comparison with the other dies of Group F; the reverse is open to criticism. The placement of the piece is determined by the single fish in the exergue, and this is confirmed by the treatment of the figure of <persName>Scylla</persName> and the form of the crest. F38 has many similarities, but F46 has a sneering expression which is foreign to the prototype. The treatment of the hair above the ear is that of Group D and is also found in F1 and F16–24. The way in which the lower portion of the crest projects below the bowl of the helmet is slovenly to a degree not found in previous dies. The figure of <persName>Scylla</persName> is also carelessly modelled. On the reverse, the letters are weak. The beautifully indicated fish is too large and it follows the line of the edge as none of its predecessors do. The head and r. foreleg of the bull are not in keeping with anything that has gone before. The weight of this piece is 15.52—a second specimen, however, weighs 14.19, and its reproduction shows strong indications of plating.</p>
               <p>Few of the earlier varieties seem to have been imitated in the plated pieces. Coin P2 is a poor derivative of Nos. D2–4–6 and the reverse limits it
<pb n="34"/>
to the last two of these. The exergual fish is not true to this prototype, but more nearly resembles F20. These combinations of an obverse with a reverse never found associated with it afford an indication that such varieties cannot have been official as some plated pieces seem to be.</p>
               <p>J36 as an imitation is very good, but again the poor workmanship confirms the low weight to show that the coin is plated. Here the type imitated is J24, obverse and reverse. The <persName>Scylla</persName> is a fairly close copy with the defects of its pattern emphasized. On the reverse the exergual line differs and the iota of the inscription seems an after-interpolation.</p>
               <p>P10 is designated by the letters HP as a copy of some one of the coins in Group N—an examination shows that bull on N12 was, unfortunately, the type chosen for imitation. The inscription is copied fairly accurately but the two fishes in the exergue as well as the placement of the letters HP above the line are in contrast with the procedure for the group with which this piece would be associated. A much more serious discrepancy, however, is provided by the obverse. For the type copied here we have to go as far back as Groups H and J, on which the <persName>Scylla</persName> is also holding a trident. The treatment of the crest of the helmet shows unmistakably that this piece is derived from the type of Group J. Further evidences of fabrication (perhaps it isn't plated) are to be seen in the smaller scale of the head—the prototype usually has the crest off-flan because of the
<pb n="35"/>
large size of the die; here the head is not in the least crowded.</p>
               <p>Generalizations without additional evidence seem of questionable value but we must bear in mind that the bronze or copper cores of these pieces militate against their survival. It is impossible to determine from casts the methods used for plating and as I have not examined the pieces in <placeName>Paris</placeName> or <placeName>Naples</placeName>, information on this score has been omitted.</p>
               <p>In an earlier day there was question of our having more than one coin from the same pair of dies. What would such doubters say to the coins P8a and P8b, which are from identical dies and <hi rend="italic">both pieces plated.</hi> The illustrations demonstrate how much better the smaller coin has withstood the surface abrasions. The absence in uniformity in the size of the flan throws some light on the methods used by the fabricators. The prototype for the obverse is M12–14–N2. Singularly enough, the presence of the half-zeta-like addition to the original die (cf. M14), shows that the plated piece was made after this addition, whatever its significance may have been. The reverse copies or imitates the reverse of N10–12. In addition to the two pieces shown<ref target="#CH1-n29">
                     <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                  </ref> a third specimen is to be found in the <placeName>Naples</placeName> Cabinet (Fiorelli 2777), weighing 15.45. Although this is not indicated as plated in the catalogue, the cast shows a characteristic indentation of the surface on the reverse which is an almost unmistakable indication
<pb n="36"/>
of plating. The most patent indication of its fabrication is to be seen in the reverse inscription which reads EH PA.</p>
               <p>P6. If further proof of the plating of P8 were needed, we have in P10 a muling of its reverse die with an obverse imitating N10—that is, it copies both obverse and reverse of this variety. I am indebted for a cast of this interesting piece to <persName>Mr. R. Cyril Lockett</persName> in whose collection it is. It will be seen that the surface is broken away below the flap of the helmet. The weight is 14.57.</p>
               <p>P4. The muling of plated pieces found in P8 and P10 is carried one step further in this coin, for here we have the obverse connected with a reverse which copies J10. This coin was No. 56 in the Hamburger 98 sale, Apr. 3, 1933, where the weight was given as 12.70. Another instance of the muling of plated coins is cited in Num. Notes and Monogr. 47, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</placeName>, Pt. II, pp. 54–5, Nos. 539–541.</p>
               <p>None of these pieces are from official dies but No. M 2 at <placeName>Berlin</placeName> is of low weight (14.39) and has been kindly indicated by <persName>Dr. Regling</persName> as possibly plated. Justification for this suspicion is to be found in the exergual line, which is unlike that of any of the others in the group, and by what appear to be breaks in the surface of the coin beneath the chin of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> on the obverse and at the tip of bull's right foreleg on the reverse. Besides this, the flan is only 24 mm. in width which is in contrast with the 28 to 30 mm. for the others in the group. The others also have hammered edges while this piece does not.</p>
