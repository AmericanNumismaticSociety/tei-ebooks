               <hi rend="bold">PREFACE</hi>
            </head>
            <p>This study was undertaken for two purposes: 1) to assemble as complete as possible a <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi> of Macedonian regal coins and 2) to seek to arrange them in coherent order. It was felt that the confusion with regard to this series of coins was due largely to its piecemeal study. With a view to the accomplishment of the first purpose coins were sought from three sources: museums and public collections, private collectors, and dealers. The response from all was most gratifying. I am happy to acknowledge the receipt of casts, photographs, and other information from the responsible authorities of the following museums and public collections: <placeName>Athens</placeName>, National Numismatic Museum; the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> collections; <placeName>Boston</placeName>, Museum of Fine Arts; Brussels, Bibliothèque Nationale; <placeName>Cambridge</placeName> University; <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, Royal Collection of Coins and Medals; <placeName>Glasgow</placeName>, Hunterian Museum; the Gotha collection; <placeName>London</placeName>, British Museum, Department of Coins; the Munich collection; <placeName>New York</placeName>, Museum of the American Numismatic Society; Oxford University; <placeName>Paris</placeName>, Cabinet des Médailles of the Bibliothèque Nationale; the <placeName>Vienna</placeName> collection; Yale University. Private collectors have been very willing to permit their treasures to be studied and published. I have been able to secure material, for which I make grateful acknowledgement, from Belgium, from <persName>M. Desneux;</persName> from <placeName>France</placeName>, from <persName>MM. Delepierre,</persName>
               <persName>Larostère</persName> and <persName>Ravel</persName>; from <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, from Mssrs. <persName>Gillet</persName>, <persName>Lambe</persName>, and <persName>May</persName>; from <placeName>Greece</placeName>, from <persName>M. Empedocles;</persName> from the <placeName>United States</placeName>, from <persName>Mr. Dewing</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Newell</persName>, <persName>Mr. Noe</persName> and <persName>Mr. Robinson</persName>. Some of these collections are large, others small, but whatever the size, they have been the source of much valuable material. All dealers have made their current stocks available to me for study, from the originals, from casts, or from photographs; some have given me news of private collectors who had material of concern to me. I should like particularly to thank <persName>Mr. Cahn</persName> of Basel, <persName>Mr. Forrer</persName> of <placeName>London</placeName>, Mr.
<pb n="x"/>
               <persName>Gans</persName> of <placeName>New York</placeName>, <persName>Dr. Hirsch</persName> of <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>Geneva</placeName>, and <persName>Mr. Kellad</persName> of <placeName>Jersey City</placeName> for their generosity and courtesy. However, it cannot be hoped that the ultimate in completeness has been attained. I know of a number of tetrobols in <placeName>Geneva</placeName> (to which I hope someday to have access) and another octadrachm from the <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName> hoard which I have not been able to see. I should be very grateful for news or casts of other coins in this series.</p>
            <p>A doctoral dissertation, of which this is a remote relative, encompassed a survey of all Macedonian regal coinage from <persName>Alexander I</persName> to <persName>Philip II</persName>. Since it was clear that so ambitious a study would be beyond the compass of a monograph, a division was made at the point where a change of standard occurred, at the end of the coinage of <persName>Perdikkas II</persName>. It is hoped that a second monograph, including the coins of Archelaus and his successors, will follow on this without too long a delay.</p>
            <p>In the course of this study I have received much valuable assistance, cheerfully given, from a number of persons. To the late <persName>E. T. Newell</persName>, who gave me my earliest encouragement in the task, my debt is unbounded. All who have crossed his path know his generosity with his magnificent collection of coins as well as with his time, learning and judgment. To <persName>David M. Robinson</persName>, under whom I took my degree, I owe not only unlimited access to all the Olynthus material and to his own collection, but also the same access to his time and advice. I am deeply obligated to him, for he is a constant source of inspiration. <persName>E. S. G. Robinson</persName> of the British Museum and <persName>C. H. V. Sutherland</persName> of Oxford University have been most helpful on a number of points which must have seemed to them both time-consuming and unimportant. The staff of the American Numismatic Society deserves any credit due anyone for this study. <persName>S. P. Noe</persName> and <persName>S. M. Mosser</persName> have borne the brunt of helping me; without their knowledge and experience to draw on I should never have finished my task. To <persName>D. Baker</persName> are due the excellent photographs from which the plates were made. I am happy to be able to thank <persName>A.R. Bellinger</persName> of Yale University for reading this in very rough draft and offering me many
<pb n="xi"/>
helpful suggestions. <persName>L. B. Yates</persName> of the University of <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> has smoothed out many rough spots. <persName>Violet E. Baker</persName> must take credit for whatever uniformity of format exists; she made the final copy for the press and eradicated my most violent inconsistencies. In spite of all this help, which I acknowledge gratefully and wonderingly, the conclusions and hypotheses herein put forth are my own and no blame can fall on anyone else.</p>
            <p>Finally, it gives me great pleasure to extend my thanks to the Board of Trustees for Institutions of Higher Learning of the State of <persName>Mississippi</persName> for the financial assistance which made possible a final visit to the Museum of the American Numismatic Society to complete work on this manuscript.</p>

            <p>While there is no period of antiquity of which we have complete knowledge, in the case of some periods and some places, we know very little indeed. One such place is the Thraco-Macedonian coastal and hinterland area; one such period is practically all the time before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. Of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> itself, even the boundaries are uncertain; the inhabitants are scarcely more than a name; the kings, until the end of the sixth century, are a legend.</p>

               <persName>Geyer</persName> and <persName>Hoffman</persName> (<hi rend="italic">RE, s.v</hi>., Makedonia) have done all that is possible with the early history, topography and ethnology of the area.<ref target="#CH1-n1">

Archaeological evidence furnishes some Minoan and some later Greek artifacts, in addition to material with Danubian affiliations, which do not particularly concern us here. Tradition connects the Bacchiad family of Corinth, in the eighth century, with Lyncestis and even with the mines used later by Damastion; Periander, about the end of the seventh or the beginning of the sixth century, is the reputed founder of both Apollonia and Potidaea, the former at the western end of the later Via Egnatia, the latter beyond its eastern

Pisistratus, in the middle of the sixth century, must have known something of the country to which he fled.</p>
            <p>From the time of <persName>Homer</persName>, there has been traditionally a close relationship between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> and <placeName>northern Greece.</placeName> The Thracians, Bryges, and Phrygians<ref target="#CH1-n5">

The story of the garden of Midas was localized on both sides of the sea. The numismatic evidence which confirms this tradition is presented in Chapter II. <persName>Herodotus</persName> (VI,47) states that Thasos was colonized by those who came with Cadmus from Phoenicia, five generations from <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref>. We know from Archilochus' shameless boast of his unmilitary attitude that it was recolonized from Paros in the seventh century.<ref target="#CH1-n6">

            <p>Of the people of Macedonia and their nature and name, there is an exasperating lack of knowledge. The earliest references are in <persName>Herodotus</persName>. Whether or not it be of any significance, he uses the form "Makednon" in references to the people in general; speaking of the country and the kings, he uses "Makedonia;" the kings' subjects, from the end of the sixth century, are "Makedonoi."<ref target="#CH1-n9">

                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> In Book VIII, 43, describing the composition of the Greek fleet before Salamis, <persName>Herodotus</persName> lists the Sicyonians, Epidaurians, Troezenians and Hermionians, "these being, except for the Hermionians, a Doric and Makednon race."<ref target="#CH1-n11">

               </ref> The kings, from the time of <persName>Alexander I</persName>, based their claims of Greek descent on their legendary association with Argos,<ref target="#CH1-n12">
                  <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
               </ref> but the legend makes no mention of any Macedonians but the kings coming from there. No other ancient writer says anything about the people.</p>
            <p>The extent of the kingdom of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> is as ill-defined as its history is fragmentary. <orgName type="ethnic">Thucydides, II</orgName>, 99, describes certain tribal areas as being part of it, but gives no fixed geographical boundaries. He seems to make a distinction between the upper country, whose tribes — Lyncestians, Elimiotes and others — were allies and subject, though they had their own kings, and the lower country, ή παρά ϑάλασσαν νῦν Maϰεδονία, which Perdikkas ruled at the beginning of
<pb n="4"/>
the Peloponnesian War and which <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and his forefathers had accumulated. It is possible to interpret some rather loose statements of <persName>Herodotus</persName> by means of this chapter of Thucydides, statements which are hard to reconcile with one another since the "Father of History" uses the words <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thrace">Thrace</placeName>,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Thracians</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Macedonians,</hi> confusingly in his account of the events before and during the Persian Wars. If a distinction is made between the extent of the kingdom at the beginning of the fifth century and at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War (or at the time <persName>Herodotus</persName> was writing his history) many difficulties are resolved. See below, pp. 8, 10-12.</p>
            <p>

the legend of <persName>Herodotus</persName> by including some of the subject matter of the oracle and enlarging upon it. Satyrus (frag. 21; <hi rend="italic">F. H. G.</hi> III, 164) gives a variant list of the mythical kings; Theopompus (frag. 30; <hi rend="italic">F. H.

Demosthenes, (<hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> III, 31) dismisses all the genealogies with the statement that <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> is no Hellene, has no kinship with any, and is not even a respectable barbarian. Other fourth century and later references to the legendary history may be disregarded as biased by the sympathies of their authors. It is only the account of <persName>Herodotus</persName> which has any claim to authority; in view of the increasing proof of the credibility of <persName>Herodotus</persName>, it is safe to accept the essential core of the story: the departure from Argos, the danger on the way, and the final establishment of a dynasty in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia.</placeName> (See also note 12.)</p>
            <p>The legend <persName>Herodotus</persName> recounts of the founding of the Macedonian kingdom is in his best vein as a story-teller. Three brothers of the house of Temenos of Argos left home, went to Illyria and thence to an unknown Lebaea (probably in upper Macedonia), where they hired out as herdsmen to the local king. The eldest brother tended the horses, the next the cattle, and the youngest, Perdikkas, had the care of what was left, the sheep and the goats. The king had little money (as was often the case with kings in those days, according to <persName>Herodotus</persName>), so that his wife needs must cook for the herdsmen. She noticed that when she set bread to rise, the loaf intended for the youngest brother always grew twice as large as that for the others and she mentioned the fact to her husband. He decided that it was time to get rid of them. As they, about to leave, asked for what was due them, the king pointed to the circle of sunlight coming through the smoke-hole of the roof, and said, "There it is." Little Perdikkas whipped out his knife, marked the circle of the sunlight on the ground with it, gathered the sunlight up into the fold of his garment and thanked the king. Thereafter, the brothers departed. Upon reflection, the king did not like the implication - presumably, that Perdikkas had thus symbolically claimed all of the land which the sun shone on,
<pb n="6"/>
and he sent his men to pursue and slay the brothers. They, after crossing a river, had stopped to sacrifice to it;<ref target="#CH1-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref> the river then rose so that the pursuing horsemen could not cross to capture them. The three fugitives finally reached the land of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, close by the gardens of Midas, son of <persName>Gordias</persName>, where the marvellous roses grew, and where the Silenus was captured "as it was said by the Macedonians, just under Mt. Bermaios; starting from there they overcame the rest of Macedonia." Then follows a list of the seven kings, <persName>Perdikkas I</persName> to <persName>Alexander I</persName>. <persName>Justinus</persName>, in using the subject matter of the oracle, gives the additional detail of their following a goat and settling where the goat indicated that they should, at a place called <persName corresp="#nomisma_valerian">Edessa</persName>, the name of which was then changed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegae_macedonia">Aegae.</placeName>

He continues with details of the reign of each of the kings, curiously reminiscent of the Roman kings. This tale cannot be considered evidence for the early history of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, and it occurs nowhere else. The chief value of the legend, aside from the fact that it was apparently believed by the judges at Olympia who allowed <persName>Alexander I</persName> to compete in the games,<ref target="#CH1-n17">
                  <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
               </ref> is the time involved, and the geography. If one may allow about three generations to a century, the Macedonian kings entered the country at the beginning of the eighth century, just about the time the Bacchiads of Corinth penetrated hither. The account of the route followed seems to be a reminiscence of the association of Macedonians with the territory north and west of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName> along the Pindus (cf. note 10), and to indicate that there
<pb n="7"/>
was a central strip of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, from the Peloponnese to the Macedonian highlands, associated with these people. Further, the legend confirms the statement of Thucydides (II, 99) that the highland interior had been the original <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia;</placeName> that the lower country, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> of his time (see above, p. 3), a later acquisition.</p>
            <p>The first really historical references to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> and its kings appear in <persName>Herodotus</persName>' account of the westward advance of the Persians; even these are of such a secondary nature that they cause more confusion than they resolve. In a digression on the end of the tyranny in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> (V, 94), he says that <persName corresp="#nomisma_amyntas_priene">Amyntas</persName>, father of <persName>Alexander I</persName>, offered Anthemus to Hippias as a refuge about 509. If Anthemus, which is located in the area south of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_therma">Therma</placeName>, southeast of the Cissus mountains, and on the north edge of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcidice">Chalcidice</placeName>, was part of the kingdom of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> at that time, <persName>Herodotus</persName>' own statements (VII, 123) that the Axius is the boundary between <placeName>Mygdonia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bottiaea">Bottiaea</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n18">

               </ref> and later (VII, 127), that the encampment of Xerxes extended from the city of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_therma">Therma</placeName> to the Lydias and Haliacmon rivers, which formed the boundary between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bottiaea">Bottiaea</placeName>, are manifestly in error. Thucydides (II, 99) confirms <persName>Herodotus'</persName> contention that the Macedonians held Anthemus, having driven out, among other tribes, the Bottiaeans to dwell on the borders of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcidice">Chalcidice</placeName>. In Book VIII, 127, <persName>Herodotus</persName> further states that the Bottiaeans, driven from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_therma">Therma</placeName>ic Gulf by the Macedonians, possessed Olynthus in 479, when Artabazus besieged it. Since Thucydides puts no date to the Macedonian conquest of the Bottiaeans, and since the only real date obtainable from <persName>Herodotus</persName> is that of the presence of Bottiaeans in Olynthus in 479, the suggestion might be made that the expulsion of the Bottiaeans from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_therma">Therma</placeName>ic Gulf did not take place until the confused period of the retreat of Xerxes after Salamis. Such a solution is impossible, however, because the evidence from the South Hill<ref target="#CH1-n19">

area for a considerable period of time by a homogeneous population. The question must be left for the time being, pending a consideration of other Herodotean references to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia.</placeName> As regards the actuality of Amyntas' offer to Hippias, we know nothing of the circumstances. Perhaps the Macedonian kings had been in communication with the Pisistratids ever since Pisistratus' first visit to the north in the middle of the sixth century.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Herodotus</persName>' casual, off-hand manner of referring to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> before and during the Persian Wars never makes quite clear the relations between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia.</placeName> As a result, the same volume of the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</hi>

               <persName>Herodotus</persName> omits also to define the limits of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia.</placeName> Aside from the brief resume of Thucydides (II, 99), we have only the statement of Strabo (VII, 7), that the territory around Lynkos, Pelagonia, Orestis, and Elimeia (i. e. upper <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>) was also called "free" <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, to indicate the area ruled by the Macedonian kings when first they appeared on the world stage. The confusion engendered by <persName>Herodotus</persName>' lack of precision is reduced, if not quite completely removed, by the interpretation that he refers in one place to the kingdom of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> at the time of the Persian Wars and in another to the geographical extent of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> at the time at which he was writing.

               <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was king at the time when Mardonius went over into Europe to prepare the way for the Persian punitive expedition, but he is not mentioned by <persName>Herodotus</persName> until much later, shortly before Thermopylae. In the abbreviated account in VI, 44-47, <persName>Herodotus</persName> recounts the actions of Mardonius - how he first subdued the Thasians; next, how with the land army, he made the Macedonians slaves, in addition to those he already had, while the navy was going from Thasos to Acanthus. When Mardonius was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> he was attacked, and very nearly defeated, by the Bryges of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thrace">Thrace</placeName>, whom he later subdued. In Mardonius' own description of these acts, when he is urging Xerxes to make the expedition (Herod. VII, 9), he makes use <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> of the phrase μέχρι Mαϰεδονίης, as far as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia.</placeName> The passage in VI, 44-47, "he made the Macedonians slaves" is taken by Geyer<ref target="#CH1-n27">

On p. 145, he states that ca. 493 "<placeName corresp="#nomisma_thrace">Thrace</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> had thrown off the Persian yoke," although by his own previous statement (p. 68), only the coast of Thrace as far as Mt. Pangaeus had been conquered; on p. 147 he again mentions the "reconquest" of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thrace">Thrace</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia;</placeName> on p. 150, the words of <persName>Herodotus</persName>

in VI, 44, mean that with the army "he added the Macedonians to the number of those in servitude." <persName>Herodotus</persName>, himself, in VII, 108, adds to the confusion in describing Xerxes' march from Doriscus by saying that, as he had already pointed out, "all the land as far as (μέχρι) <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName> had been enslaved and was tributary to the king, conquered by <persName>Megabazus</persName> and later by <persName>Mardonius</persName>." Three chapters before (105), Xerxes was reported as leading his army "through Thrace into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>," by a route which lay close to the sea although the army marched in three divisions. From Doriscus he went to Acanthus, from there across the top of the Chalcidic peninsula to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_therma">Therma</placeName>, where he met the fleet and stayed some time, his encampment reaching (VII, 127) from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_therma">Therma</placeName> to the Lydias and Haliacmon rivers - the boundary between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bottiaea">Bottiaea.</placeName> After his review of the troops he proceeded over the "Macedonian mountain" to arrive at Perrhaibia (VII, 131). <persName>How</persName> and <persName>Wells</persName>, <hi rend="italic">ad loc</hi>.,<ref target="#CH1-n29">

               </ref> conclude that this mountain is really the series of hills in the coastal section known earlier as Pieria, a conclusion which is indicated by the statement earlier in the same chapter that Xerxes passed some days in Pieria.</p>
            <p>The description of Xerxes' retreat and of <persName>Mardonius</persName>' whereabouts during the following winter (<persName>Herodotus</persName>, VIII) includes similar vague references to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia.</placeName> In chapter 115, Xerxes left some of the sick in Siris of Paeonia and in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia;</placeName> he asked of the Paeonians the chariot and horses which he had left in their care. They replied that the upper Thracians, about the sources of the Strymon, had taken the chariot and driven off the horses. In 126, <persName>Mardonius</persName> was wintering "about <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>," while, in 131 and 133 only <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName> is mentioned as his winter quarters. If the irreconcilable statements of <persName>Herodotus</persName> be taken as referring to two different concepts, a measure of clarity results; <persName>Mardonius</persName>' admission that he went only as far as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> (VII, 9) should be construed as referring to the independent kingdom (Strabo's free <placeName>Macedonia)</placeName>, while the majority of the other references are to the territory known to <persName>Herodotus</persName>' audience as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> in their time, the ή παρά

            <p>
               <persName>Herodotus</persName>' reference to, and his failure to mention, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> at certain significant points confirm an interpretation along the lines suggested. In all the contacts between Persian and Macedonian following the arrival of <persName>Mardonius</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> does not appear. In VII, 22, <persName>Bubares</persName>, son of <persName>Megabazus</persName>, who is probably the brother- in-law of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> (cf. <persName>Herodotus</persName>, V, 22), is one of the two overseers of the construction of the canal across <placeName>Athos</placeName>. Perhaps the omission of reference to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> here is of minor importance, but why does not Xerxes during his stop at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_therma">Therma</placeName> (VII, 127) summon the ruler of the Macedonians before him? While Xerxes was still at Abydos (VII, 174), <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had warned the Greeks at Tempe of the size of the army and navy of the enemy and had advised them to depart. Since "the Macedonian seemed kindly disposed to them" they (the Greeks) took his advice, although <persName>Herodotus</persName> believes that the reason for their departure lay in their learning of the existence of the route into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName> from upper Macedonia through Perrhaibia to Gonnus, by which the army of Xerxes was marching.<ref target="#CH1-n30">

            <pb n="13"/>
            <p>There is silence concerning <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> activities until after Thermopylae, when the section of the Persian army under Xerxes entered Boeotia on its way to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> (VIII, 34). "The whole lot of the Boeotians Medized; some of the cities Macedonian men, sent by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, διατεταγμένοι, saved. They saved them for this reason (or in this way), wishing to make clear to Xerxes that the Boeotians were kindly disposed toward the Medes." The participle, modifying the "Macedonian men" is ambiguous: it can mean "drawn up in battle array" or, as <persName>How</persName> and <persName>Wells</persName>, <hi rend="italic">ad. loc., "dispositi per urbes."</hi> The passage is generally taken as a guarantee by the Macedonians of Boeotian support for Xerxes. This is the simplest interpretation, but erroneous, as I think, because there is no evidence that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> himself Medized. It is possible that he somehow put up a front for disaffected Boeotian cities and disarmed Persian suspicion of them. The significance of the word "saved" is uncertain: did he save them from destruction by the Persians or did he, by a ruse, save them intact to join the defenders of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> when they could? Since it appears to be a voluntary act on the part of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, similar to his visit to the Greeks at Tempe and his appearance in the Greek camp at Plataea (Herod. IX, 44-45), and not a mission such as that entrusted to him officially by <persName>Mardonius</persName> (VIII, 136), it would seem more logical to construe it as an act friendly to the Greeks than to the Persians.</p>
            <p>In the following year (479) when <persName>Mardonius</persName> was in sole command in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, after consulting various oracles in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, he sent <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> (VIII, 136) to win over the Athenians to the Persian side, in accordance with the recommendation of the oracles received. In his appearance before the Athenians, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> made a very dispassionate speech, as the mouthpiece of <persName>Mardonius</persName> who was carrying out an order from Xerxes. After transmitting the message he urged the Athenians to accept the offer in view of the terms; his exhortation is prefaced by "I shall say nothing about my existing goodwill toward you (for you are not now learning of it for the first time)." <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> here is a diplomat and while he must,
<pb n="14"/>
as Persian envoy, make a gesture toward forwarding the Persian cause, he is able to make the Athenians aware that he does not really advocate their joining the Persians. The Lacedaemonian embassy, calling <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> a tyrant who joins with tyrants (VIII, 142), says to the Athenians all the things <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> cannot say officially. The offer is refused by the Athenians, who surely must have been grateful to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> for enabling them to strengthen their position in the Greek world by their refusal. In their reply to the Spartans, they use it as a means of pressing the Lacedaemonians to send troops at once.</p>
            <p>This choice of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> as envoy was made for two reasons (136). He was related to the Persians, for his sister had married Bubares<ref target="#CH1-n32">

The following year, during the retreat of Artabazus (Herod. IX, 89), his army was beset by Thracians. Demosthenes (XXIII, 200) states that Perdikkas, whom he elsewhere confuses with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, destroyed the Persians and made final the defeat of the King. Since the story of the gift from Xerxes comes only from a later source and is not mentioned by <persName>Herodotus</persName>, the truth of it may be questioned. Consideration of only the evidence of <persName>Herodotus</persName> and Thucydides, with a measure of confirmation from Demosthenes and Strabo, makes it possible to arrive at a working hypothesis. Upper <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, the original home land, remained untouched by the advance of the Persians. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, who had possibly inherited a larger territory through the efforts of his predecessors, but a territory not thoroughly assimilated, retired to the uplands and avoided submission to the Persians.<ref target="#CH1-n42">

The fact that a section of upper <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, in which there was a town Argos, was called Orestis, points to a Peloponnesian connection.

               <p>The older oracle is given by the Scholiast to Clement of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">Protrepticon</hi>, II, 11P: "Take heed, godlike Caranus, and store up my word in your mind. Leave Argos and Hellas of the fair women, and go to the springs of Haliacmon. There when first you see goats grazing, it is your fate to dwell much envied, you and all your family." The second oracle, or a revised version of the first, is given by Diodorus Siculus, VII, 16, 1: (it was addressed to Perdikkas) "There is a royal might over a wealth-producing land for the reverend sons of Temenus. For aegis-bearing Zeus gives it. But go in haste to the Bottiaean land of many flocks. There if you see gleaming-horned, snow-white goats sunk in sleep on the floor of that ground, sacrifice to the blessed gods and found the fortress of a city." Parke, <hi rend="italic">History of the Delphic Oracle</hi>, 65-66, whose translations I give, points out that, aside from the recipient of the prophecy, the two oracles have practically the same content except for the one item which serves to indicate which is the earlier. If it be remembered that Philip transferred the capital of Macedonia from Aegae to Pella, it is immediately apparent that the second version must have been current after that change. The first, which prophesies that the royal house will always have its seat at Aegae may go back to the fifth century. Parke would connect it with the time when <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> I had received recognition in Greece and'had dedicated his golden statue at Delphi: "Delphi returned the compliment by providing a document in support of his genealogy." I believe it cannot be dated to a time when <persName>Herodotus</persName> was writing, but it may go back to the fifth century.</p>

Cary</persName> in Harpers Classical Series (1859) translates it "prince" which is its logical meaning here, I believe. This episode is of considerable importance for the relation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia.</placeName> The envoy, in making his demand for the ladies, says to Amyntas, "since you are giving earth and water;" Geyer (<hi rend="italic">RE, s. v.</hi>
                  <placeName>Makedonia</placeName>, col. 702) concludes that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> was a subject state of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia.</placeName> Grundy, <hi rend="italic">The Persian Wars</hi>, 68, concedes a doubtful submission but "it is a doubtful question whether the submission was very real;" on 71 he states that "Megabazus' operation convinced Amyntas of the advisability of submitting to Persian suzerainty." The evidence does not warrant concluding that Macedonia became a dependency of <placeName>Persia:</placeName> the envoys to whom earth and water were given were dead when the search party came to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> seems to have negotiated a compromise. It was a bold deed that the young heir to the throne perpetrated (<persName>How</persName> and <persName>Wells</persName> suggest that he may have been on the throne at this time, which is unlikely in view of Amyntas' offer to Hippias in 510 or 509) and one that marks him a man of swift decision and prompt action. These traits are likewise revealed in his later actions, not alone against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, but against any one who interfered with his plans. He is a worthy ancestor of the enterprising Philip and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander III</persName>.</p>

               </ref> The <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> regal coinage epitomizes that complexity, for there is no apparent relation between the weights of the octa- drachms and tetradrachms, and the smaller coins are fractions of one or the other large denomination. In other words, it appears that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, and Perdikkas, struck silver coins on two standards simultaneously.

            <p>Nos. 1, 4, and 6 have a common denominator and Nos. 2, 3, and 5 are similarly related. It is noteworthy that all these weights are found, along with still others not used by the Macedonian kings, in the Thraco-Macedonian tribal coinage. Head (see note 1) and others have assigned those sixth century tribal coins weighing ca. 9+ to the "Babylonian" standard and those of 28 + to 29 + to the Phoenician standard, both of which assignments are plausible, but no one has satisfactorily explained the tetradrachms of 13 + or -. Coins of this weight were struck over a long period of time for they were used from the sixth to the fourth century, when they composed the bulk of the coinage of Damastion.<ref target="#CH2-n3">

            <p>Because the weights used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> for his coins had been used in the sixth century tribal issues, it is logical to look to them for an explanation of the standard. The data collected by Svoronos<ref target="#CH2-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> are valuable for this search, since they are remarkably complete. Gie- secke<ref target="#CH2-n5">

               </ref> has recently used this material in his study of the weight- standards of the Thraco-Macedonian region; and while he saw the original source of the weights, the "Babylonian" mina, he has misunderstood the use to which it was put. Before Giesecke, Head (see note 1) had the key to the solution of the problem of these weights, as had Haeberlin,<ref target="#CH2-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> but neither had studied all the pertinent material. The various weights of the coins assembled by Svoronos
<pb n="20"/>
must be based upon some common factor, because of the fact that the same type is used on coins of seemingly unrelated weights<ref target="#CH2-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> issued by one agent. That common factor is the fiftieth part of the light Babylonian mina of 491 +.</p>
            <p>By one of the fortunate chances of survival, there have been preserved stone and bronze weights giving the value of the light and heavy Babylonian mina.<ref target="#CH2-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> The fact that individual specimens date from 2000 B. C. to 650 B. C. is clear evidence of the fidelity with which the standards were maintained. Both the heavy (505) and the light (491) mina go back to the time of Dungi, of the dynasty of Ur, ca. 2456-2398.<ref target="#CH2-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref> As specimens of both standards are inscribed "of the King" (in cuneiform) and "of the country" (in Aramaic), the co-existence of the two standards for all uses is fact, not fancy. The purpose of the two slightly different standards is as yet unknown; however, it is worth remarking that 505 = 491 + 1/36, which calculation implies a tax on the light mina. Lehman-Haupt and Haeber- lin<ref target="#CH2-n10">

               </ref> were in possession of these facts and from them went on to fanciful suppositions. They hypothecated additional taxes of various proportions, proposed precious metal minas which were 50/60 of the weight minas, and finally ended with <hi rend="italic">four</hi> minas: a common and a royal gold mina and a common and royal silver mina. By taxing these minas they were able to account for all <orgName type="ethnic">Asiatic Greek</orgName> weight- standards, as well as that of the coins under consideration. <persName>Lehman- Haupt</persName> identified this latter standard as the fiftieth part of the "Light Babylonic Weight-Mina of the Royal Norm heightened by 1/24."

The system is a complex one, extremely ingenious in its use of both the Oriental and the <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> denominations.

The octobol of 4.36 (Column 2), a close approximation of the Attic drachma, seems not to have appeared until comparatively late in the series of tribal issues and may plausibly be associated with Pisistra- tus' stay in the north (556-546, but see note 14). A chronological study of the tribal coinage should do much to clarify the growth of

the system. The absence of historical records for this region has undoubtedly been a large factor in the neglect under which it has been allowed to languish. The legendary association of the north with both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> Minor and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> proper is emphasized by the mixture of Oriental and <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> divisions in these weights.</p>
            <p>The coinage of Abdera has quite generally been considered as on the Phoenician standard (see note 19), with various theories to account for fluctuations in weight. No one has yet, however, devised a reason why the people of Teos should have turned to the use of this standard when they settled in the north.<ref target="#CH2-n20">
                  <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
               </ref> It is clear that Abdera merely began coining on the standard already in use, taking the triple stater (Column 1) as an octadrachm (Column 3). The Phoenician standard was a little lighter (14. 43, for the tetradrachm), and it is possible that the fluctuations in the weights of Abderitan coins can be traced to that difference. <persName>Roebuck</persName>

               </ref> recently, in drawing some very interesting conclusions about trade from the contents of Egyptian coin hoards, makes certain misleading statements about Chios and her relations with the Thraco-Macedonian region. He states (p. 240) that "The symbols on its (Chios') earliest coins, found, significantly enough, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, are similar to those of the early Thraco- Macedonian group." In a footnote (53) he lists them as sphinx, rosette, cock's head and lotus. This sphinx occurs only on the coins of Abdera. I am not aware of the use of the cock's head as a symbol in the north, although the rosette is common there and elsewhere. If by the "lotus" he means the stylized Pangaean rose, it is the one symbol which was assuredly used in the north. On the same page, his next sentence reads: "Further, when Abdera began to coin after its recolonization by Teos, it did so on a standard related to the Chian, which would indicate one area of Chian influence in this region." It is hard to understand the basis for this statement. The Chian standard of ca. 15.52 has no obvious relation to that of Abdera.</p>

In the lists of weights of the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and Perdikkas at the end of this chapter, it may be seen how varied are the weights within a denomination and how little this variation has to do with chronology. It would be idle conjecture to devise reasons for the fluctuation; often two coins from the same die or dies will vary widely in weight. Since it is noticeable in all denominations and in coins of all types (i. e., in the tribal issues) it perhaps may be attributed to carelessness resulting from widespread acceptance of the standard. The fact that many of the early coins, and even those of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, found in hoards in remote lands,<ref target="#CH2-n22">
                  <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
               </ref> are slashed or otherwise disfigured can be taken to mean that these coins, accepted "at home" at face value, were only accepted abroad after being weighed and tested for purity. In view of the certainty of the weights for the denominations listed in the chart, it has not been felt necessary to construct frequency tables. Indeed, the meticulous consideration of extant weights in any series is superogatory, since ancient methods of minting and the whole ancient conception of the purpose of coinage differ so greatly from those of the present.</p>
            <p>Without a detailed study of all the tribal issues and the directions of northern trade, it is impossible to decide the chronological order of the development. A number of the denominations were comparatively short-lived, particularly the large ones; probably they were too large for convenient use. The triple stater, or octadrachm, was struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and by Abdera until the middle of the fifth cen-

tury. The tetradrachm of 14.73 used by Abdera, was adopted by the Chalcidic League before the end of the fifth century and was used for the first time in Macedonia by <persName>Philip II</persName>. The tetradrachm of 13.09, used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> until the middle of the fifth century, was used in the fourth century by the kings of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paeonia">Paeonia</placeName> and by <persName>Damastion</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-n23">

            <p>This tetradrachm of 13.09, created by multiplying rather than by dividing or reclassifying,<ref target="#CH2-n24">

               </ref> as was the case with the triple stater, has as its point of contact with the original system (Column 1 on the chart) the trite (3.27) of the original stater. The trite was multiplied like a drachma to produce the tetradrachm of 13.09. The earliest such coins have a Pegasus obverse type (often attributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_therma">Therma</placeName>).<ref target="#CH2-n25">

            <p>A search for the possible reason for the evaluation of this denomination led into the baffling realm of electrum. Fraught with peril is a journey thereto. Instead of one Scylla and a single Charybdis, the traveler is beset by monsters more fearsome than <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> or Oriental ever imagined. These monsters are (1) the relative value of gold and silver, at a given time or generally; (2) the consequent relative value of electrum and the other metals; (3) the very nature of electrum, i. e., whether it was a natural or an artificial alloy, or both at different times; (4) the ability of the ancients to determine the proportion of each metal in a given coin; (5) their use of that ability.<ref target="#CH2-n26">

on probabilities, rather than on actualities, because of the uncertainty as to the true nature of any electrum coinage, it seems not improper to set forth the results of the inquiry into the reasons for the creation of the tetradrachm of 13.09.<ref target="#CH2-n27">

            <p>Electrum as a moneyer's metal, as contrasted with its use for jewelry, should be examined (a) for its weight standard, (b) for its alloy, and (c) for the relation of these two factors to current values of gold and silver. The generally accepted relation of the latter is 13.3-1, a rather awkward figure for the moneyer.<ref target="#CH2-n28">
                  <hi rend="sup">28</hi>
               </ref> It has been suggested that electrum stood in relation to silver as 10-1, actually or as a convenience,<ref target="#CH2-n29">
                  <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
               </ref> i. e., any electrum coin became arbitrarily to be worth ten times its weight in silver, regardless of the alloy. This is a workable hypothesis, for an equation can always be worked out between electrum and <hi rend="italic">some</hi> silver issue on this basis. Since we know so little of the direction of trade in antiquity, it is impossible to prove that any such equation was in use in trade - or, equally, that it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in use.</p>
            <p>Such reckoning ignored the proportion of gold and silver in any electrum piece, although it is hard to understand how, in the fiercely competitive struggle between coins of different standards, the ancients would be willing to accept at a nominal value a coin, the metal content of which was unknown and unknowable to them. While Pliny<ref target="#CH2-n30">
                  <hi rend="sup">30</hi>
               </ref> states that electrum must be one-fifth silver and four-fifths gold, and that it is a naturally occurring alloy, Hammer<ref target="#CH2-n31">
                  <hi rend="sup">31</hi>
               </ref> has shown that the alloy as found in different parts of the world is very irregular. He concludes that there was available in antiquity electrum of the proportions given by Pliny, but none of the coins which he analyzes has so large a gold content, and in his entire lists the proportions vary greatly. When of the two electrum coins of the same weight,
<pb n="29"/>
one contains one-third gold and the other two-thirds, how can one say that these coins both equal ten silver pieces of the same weight as the electrum? Theophrastus' description of the touchstone (which he calls the Lydian stone), by which it was possible to "recognize the purity of the gold and silver as well as the amount of copper and how much was mixed in a stater,"<ref target="#CH2-n32">
                  <hi rend="sup">32</hi>
               </ref> indicates that it was used for testing electrum coins. The well-known monetary agreement between Phocaea and Mytilene<ref target="#CH2-n33">
                  <hi rend="sup">33</hi>
               </ref> can only be interpreted as referring to an artificial alloy, although, unfortunately, the decree does not name the proportions.</p>
            <p>Specific gravity tests applied to electrum coins showed clearly the variant proportions of gold and silver in different coins, often of the same weight. Hammer, in the article cited in note 31, went further than specific gravity tests; he subjected as many coins as possible to chemical analysis, from which it became evident that varying amounts of copper (cf. Theophrastus), and even of other metals, were introduced into the alloy to secure greater hardness. The addition of these metals, hitherto unsuspected, affects adversely the accuracy of the specific gravity figure. Such a test could not be applied to every electrum coin for obvious reasons, but from the number of coins available to him, Hammer has been able to work out a formula to express the relation between the specific gravity finding and the result of chemical analysis. This perhaps is not minutely accurate in every case, but it serves to bring a certain uniformity into the relative contents of the metals in any electrum coin of which the specific gravity is known. Thus it is possible to reach rather sound conclusions as to the standard of electrum coins and their worth. Viedebantt<ref target="#CH2-n34">

It is useless to try to find the reason why 1/70 should be the division chosen for the early electrum, Lydian, Ionian and Thraco-Macedonian. It was not until Croesus struck his first gold coins that the division of 1/60 was used. The large proportion of gold in the group here considered Thraco-Macedonian gave it a stability which the eastern electrum did not have,<ref target="#CH2-n43">

The tribes of northern <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, with their fabulously wealthy gold and silver mines, presumably began coining in electrum, having taken their standard from those moneyers of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> Minor who struck the earliest coins. When the Thraco-Macedonians began striking in silver, they used a different fraction (1/50) of the mina of 491 for their stater, the trite of which, multiplied into the tetradrachms of 13.09 served to make exchangeable electrum and silver. Because the mina of 491 was the one used for silver, it may be that this early electrum was 1/70 of that same mina. However, I give the equation for both standards.</p>

            <p>It can thus be suggested that Croesus struck gold at 1/60 of the light mina to exchange with electrum at 1/70 of the same mina and that the debasement of the electrum led to its abandonment and the substitution of the Croesean silver of 10.90, ten of which would

The obverse type is the Gorgoneion, used on silver by Neapolis-Daton in a style which appears to be slightly later than that of the electrum. The reverse type is four pellets, one in each corner of the shallow incuse, connected diagonally with two lines at the intersection of which there is a fifth pellet.

The proportions of gold and silver are the opposite of that in the earlier electrum - ⅓ gold and ⅔ silver. These electrum coins confirm the hypothesis offered earlier, that Pisistratus developed the Attic standard from the northern one, for they are exchangeable with Attic tetradrachms.</p>

            <p>Here the equation is not so precise as in the other group; it is very close for the exchange of the Attic tetradrachm with the electrum, but less satisfactory for the tetradrachm of 13.09. I should suggest that this rather short-lived issue of electrum was a first attempt to exchange Attic and tribal issues, but that it was soon abandoned because of the far more exact equation of five tetradrachms of 13.09 (65.45) with four tetradrachms of 17.44 (65.76) It is of some importance, however, to note that the relative value of electrum and silver, 5-1, as used in the above equation can be confirmed by the reverse type of the electrum with its five connected pellets.</p>
            <p>If the weights and affiliations of these two groups of electrum issues are carefully considered, it is possible to arrive at rather stable chronology. The first issue, begun shortly after the beginning of the sixth century, on the unit of the earliest electrum, that dated by the Artemision base find to the end of the seventh or beginning of the sixth century, would be contemporary with the earliest coinage in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> proper; it lasted until Croesus, sometime after 561, introduced gold at 8.18. Shortly after 556, Pisistratus came north, adopted the unit of 4.36 (the octobol of the tetradrachm of 13.09) as his drachma, whereupon the tribes about Neapolis, at least,<ref target="#CH2-n46">
                  <hi rend="sup">46</hi>
               </ref> issued an electrum unit for exchange. This second group of electrum then is to be dated about the middle of the sixth century and probably did not survive the departure of Pisistratus in 546. After this Neapolis struck silver, with the same obverse type, of the weight of the Thraco-Macedonian staters, 9.82. The fortunes of the heavier Attic currency assured the continued value of the tetradrachm of 13.09, even though no further electrum was coined in that area.</p>

in Thrace and its type is distinctly Thracian (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, g).

               </ref> The Ionian Revolt coinage is characterized by a variety of obverse types, probably representative of the various cities which joined in the issue, an incuse reverse, which is very deeply struck, quartered linearly, as is the Thracian piece. The weight standard is 14.04, 1/35 of the mina of 491, and the gold content is one-third of the total. These coins revive the standard of the earliest Ionian electrum, but are double staters. They were designed to be exchangeable with Attic tetradrachms,<ref target="#CH2-n49">

            <p>It will be noted that this equation, which is slightly favorable to the Attic currency, used the 5-1 ratio of electrum and silver which was that used for the Gorgoneion type electrum of 8.18 in exchange with Attic currency.</p>

The type of this coin is a modification of one of the tribal Dionysiac types (cf. Chapter III) which was widely used in the area.

            <p>It will be seen seen that, while the gold rate is constant, as it seems to have been at least until the end of the fifth century, the rate for electrum has increased almost to the conventional 10-1. However, none of the electrum considered can be used at that rate of exchange without doing violence to the well-attested ratio of gold and silver. It is strange that this electrum cannot be used with the Ionian Revolt

electrum with which it was contemporary. It must be concluded that both groups of electrum were for the purpose of dealing with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> rather than with each other.</p>
            <p>The first at least of these three series of electrum coins, which shows so clearly the reason for the creation of the tetradrachm of 13.09, is of considerable chronological importance, both for the date of the introduction of the tetradrachm and for the origin of the whole series of Thraco-Macedonian tribal issues. The number of coins adduced as evidence is assuredly small. There exist also fractional pieces whose types and fabric are similar. Since these have not been analyzed, it has seemed unwise to argue from them. Electrum currency probably never played a large part in the monetary affairs of the north; the two later series of electrum just discussed, show that it served for only international trade after the middle of the sixth century. Its chief importance is as the source of the much-misunderstood tetradrachm, the vitality of which is attested by the variety of types (i. e., of issuing tribes; cf. Chapter III), its retention by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, and its much later survival in the coinage of Damastion and the Paeonian dynasts. Its ease of exchange with Attic tetra- drachms, at the rate of four to three, and also with the tetradrachms of Ainos,<ref target="#CH2-n52">
                  <hi rend="sup">52</hi>
               </ref> at the rate of five to four, are reasons for its vitality.</p>
            <p>The original stater of 9.82, which is the basis for the luxuriant variety of denominations, disappeared with, or shortly before, the retreat of the <orgName type="ethnic">Persians</orgName>, except at Thasos and possibly the mainland directly opposite that island.

               </ref> and using its type as a reverse for his tetradrachms and some fractional pieces. The varieties used, with their correlation with other currencies used in the northern Aegean, give some indications of the directions of Macedonian commerce, outside the tribal area.</p>

            <p>The fractional issues smaller than no. 6 are difficult to classify, because of the slight possible variation in weights between the heavy and the light obol. It would be of interest to know the Macedonian names for nos. 3-6. Possibly they were referred to by their types, like Athenian "Owls" or Corinthian "Colts."</p>
            <p>In view of the fact that the norms for the denominations used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> have been worked out from the lighter Babylonian mina, it has not been necessary to arrange frequency tables. A list is appended of the weights of the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and Perdikkas, in which the fluctuations are evident. There is no indication of a lowering of the standard, an event which probably occurred much less frequently than supposed. Part of the weight variation may have been caused by wear (this is particularly true in the case of the coins of Perdikkas) and much of it must have been the result of careless preparation of the flans. The two tetrobol denominations show a few wildly aberrant weights in Group I; in Group II, the light tetrobols also show a few, but in later groups this is not the case. I think that the explanation lies in the close approximation in the size of the flans for the denominations. In Group I, there was so much experimentation and change that it is quite possible that workmen got the flans confused; in Group II, some few remaining heavy tetrobol flans may have been carelessly thrown in with the others to be used up, since the heavy tetrobols were not struck during Group II. The variant weights of the tetradrachms defy explanation: some coins struck from the same pair of dies differ widely in weight. I append a list of the weights of all denominations except the small fractions in all groups.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>, xli-xliv, 194-214, 253-254, assigns coins to the Babylonian or to the Phoenician standard. <persName>Babelon</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Traite</hi>, I, 2, 1035-6, 1080, 1095-8 (hereafter <hi rend="italic">BT</hi>) and Gaebler, <hi rend="italic">Die Antiken Münzen Nord-Griechenlands</hi>, (hereafter <hi rend="italic">AMNG</hi>) III, 2, <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>, substantially agree with Head. In a series of articles in the <hi rend="italic">Sitz. Ber. Klass.

Svoronos, <hi rend="italic">JIAN</hi>, 1919, 1-265, <persName>"L'Hellenisme</persName> primitif de la Macédoine" (tableau métrologique, at the end), calls the standard Paeonian, although he does not clearly define the relation of the various denominations to one another and has no historical source for the weights he gives as norms.

                  </hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Coins</hi>, 65 ff., also uses the term Paeonian but his explanation of it is incorrect. Viedebantt, <hi rend="italic">Antike Gewichtsnormen und Münzfüsse</hi>, 70-72, (hereafter <hi rend="italic">AGM</hi>) is substantially correct in his derivation of the stater used in the Thraco-Macedonian area from the Babylonian mina and his recognition that the large "Phoenician octadrachms" are really triple staters, but (a) he does not account for any of the other weights, and (b) he creates a mina of ninety staters to adapt the stater to the Attic system, even though he is forced to leave open the question of the reason for a mina of ninety staters. Giesecke, <hi rend="italic">Antikes Geldwesen</hi>, 39-40, (hereafter <hi rend="italic">AG</hi>) accepts a division of the Babylonian mina as a source, but misnames the stater; recently, in <hi rend="italic">Hamb. Beit. z. Num</hi>., III (1949), 1-15, he changes the name of the stater, but is still wrong.</p>

               <p>So far as I know, there is no generally accepted explanation of the source of the Attic standard, usually reckoned as 8.72. It has been attributed to the Egyptian Delta where a <hi rend="italic">kedet</hi> of 8.74-9.07 was in use (<persName>Gardner</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi> 157) and it has been associated with certain electrum coins usually attributed to Samos (<hi rend="italic">HN<hi rend="sup">2</hi>,</hi> 602) and dated to the period of Polycrates, 532-522. Since the <placeName>Athenian</placeName> coins on the standard which is undefined are the product of Pisistratus (561-527) Samos cannot be a source for them. The Egyptian <hi rend="italic">kedet</hi> is too high in weight. In the course of this study, I have come upon two possible sources for the Pisistratid weight, either of which may be correct and both of which may be wrong. Since, however, the field is still open, I submit my suggestions:</p>
               <p>1. Before the time of Croesus (561-546), there had been struck Lydian electrum coins weighing 10.19, 1/45 of the light Babylonian mina (<hi rend="italic">HN<hi rend="sup">2</hi>,</hi> 644). Pisistratus must have been aware of the Oriental sexagesimal division of the mina, which had long been in use as a weight; from this Lydian electrum (some of the earliest money, probably to be dated about the end of the seventh or the beginning of the sixth century) he may have assumed a mina of 654. 1/75 of this figure is 8.74.</p>
               <p>2. If Pisistratus owned mines in the north, he must have been acquainted with the weight system in use there. The octobol in Column 2 of the chart of Thraco-Macedonian weights (4.36) is almost the exact equivalent of the Attic drachma. <persName>Gardner</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Ancient Coinage</hi>, 157, has already suggested that Pisistratus got his standard from the north, but he referred it to the stater of that area (9.82), the weight of which he thought was ca. 9.07. As the chart shows, the stater is too heavy to have been the model for the heavier Attic tetradrachm of Pisistratus; the octobol of 4.36 is the more likely source.</p>

               <p>Cf. note 1. The name "Paeonian" is misleading because at the time that this standard began to be used Paeonia was not, so far as we know, a unit. Pangaean might be a better term, in view of the major source of metal supply, but Thraco-Macedonian at least has a virtue of exactness of the original place of use.</p>

            <p>A survey of the coinage attributed to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, the first coins in that long series of Macedonian regal issues, reveals a decided difference between them and the coins of the majority of the <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> city- states. Nearly all <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> cities displayed extreme conservatism as regards types, which were few and essentially only variants of one major theme, and denominations, which likewise were few and obviously related to one another. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> coins display as wide a variety of types as of denominations and the variety is as incoherent as the denominations are. The seemingly abrupt appearance of Macedonian regal currency early in the fifth century does not mean that it was the result of spontaneous generation; it is rooted in the past and represents an inheritance from the sixth century tribal issues, long known for their variety of types and incomprehensible weight standard. As <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> used certain denominations used earlier by the tribes, so also he used some of their types.</p>

               <p>For a century or more before the advent of the signed currency of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, the whole Thraco-Macedonian coastal and hinterland area had produced a rich and diversified series of coins. These have been studied painstakingly by Svoronos in the article already cited,<ref target="#CH3-n1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>but his assignments of the various types have not been generally accepted, nor are they all acceptable. Nevertheless, his collection and illustration of the varieties classed as "uncertain, probably Thraco-Macedonian" and homeless, lo, these many years, make it possible to survey the group in its approximate entirety. By considering the coins as a homogeneous group, one is able to see clearly
<pb n="44"/>
a pattern in which three major religious or mythological types are associated with certain denominations, each of which is issued by one or more tribes. No tribe seems to have used all the types and all the denominations: some used several of each; some confined themselves to one. The three types are associated respectively with Dionysus, Ares, and Apollo-Hermes.<ref target="#CH3-n2">

               <p>The types involving oxen, their driver, caduceus, and rose or other solar symbol<ref target="#CH3-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> are those of Apollo-Hermes; the horse, alone, attended, being mounted or ridden, and the dog, possibly the lion, allude to Ares. Dionysiac types are more varied - nymphs, satyrs, centaurs and the vine. There are some additional types: Pegasus, Gorgoneion (see note 3), <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref>, and various animals, which do not fall into these categories. The pattern, reduced to its simplest terms, is this:</p>

               <p>The fractions smaller than the stater continue these types in a more complex pattern, study of which would surely clarify much that is obscure in the arrangement of the coins. The reverses, with their various sorts of incuse and subsequent types, should also prove enlightening in the final attribution of the coins and the location of their issuing agents. Inscriptions <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to have been used first on the obverse and

to have been considered originally as symbols;<ref target="#CH3-n4">

                  </ref> later, they become so complete as to compare favorably with those on Hellenistic coins. The archaic form of some of the letters appearing on the tribal issues is retained on the earliest inscribed coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
               <p>The types most generally used (those of Apollo-Hermes, Ares, and Dionysus, as well as the somewhat less frequently occurring Herak- lean types) have a natural association with the area. Tradition and common consent localized the myth of Hermes and the cattle of the Sun in the north,<ref target="#CH3-n5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> where Apollo was pre-eminently a sun-god. The Pangaean rose, the extraordinary beauty of which was mentioned as late as Pliny,<ref target="#CH3-n6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> has the same applicability as a solar symbol as the canting type of Rhodes, the connection of which with Helios or Apollo is generally recognized. It is quite possible that the "dotted theta" was originally a stylized version of this rose. The rose, or an unidentifiable flowering plant, appears as a symbol with nearly every type and in nearly every denomination. As far as I am able to determine, the caduceus is used as a symbol only in Macedonia; e. g., as a brand on horses (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 5);<ref target="#CH3-n7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref> in the hand of Hermes, it appears in other sectors. All signs point to Apollo as the more important of the two divinities: the legend itself, which makes Hermes' stay in the neighborhood brief and not particularly honorable; the types, which as frequently show the oxen drawing a cart as being led off by an attendant who is presumed to be Hermes even when he lacks the caduceus; and the more frequent use of various solar symbols.</p>
               <p>Ares and Dionysus, who were always a bit embarrassing to the <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> Pantheon, were at home in the north. Ares is associated with the man-eating steeds of Diomedes of Thrace and with the supernatural
<pb n="46"/>
horses of Rhoesus. Later, the "Thracian rider" or <hi rend="italic">eques Romanus</hi> of many reliefs attests the relation. Recently, <persName>Jean Babelon</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH3-n8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> has attempted to give a name to this divine rider, but so much conjecture is necessary in any such essay that it is better simply to say that he is to be connected with the cult of Ares. Whether he be warrior or hunter is difficult to determine; his attire, on the coins, is that of a hunter while the use of the helmet as symbol or reverse type shows that the arts of war are somehow involved. In the catalogue of the Macedonian coins, where a rider is the type, I have used the term "warrior-hunter" because a decision is impossible. Later reliefs show the rider clad sometimes as a hunter and sometimes as a warrior. Dionysus spent his childhood on <placeName>Mt. Pangaeon.</placeName> Brought up by Nys(s)a, he rollicked there with all his merry crew- nymphs, satyrs, centaurs - and his worship was conducted by the Bessi.<ref target="#CH3-n9">

                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>The appearance of the hero <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref> as a type on the tribal issues is quite wide-spread and is explained by his deeds in the north. He captured the horses of Diomedes and then founded the city of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_abdera_thrace">Abdera</placeName>, establishing games there in honor of his friend Abderus, who was killed while helping him secure the horses. It may be mentioned in passing that the later use of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref> or his equipment as a type by the Macedonian kings seems to originate not so much in this natural association of the hero with the area as from the legend which traced the ancestry of the kings to Argos, whose hero <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref> was.<ref target="#CH3-n10">

               <p>Of the animals which are used as types, the goat and the cow with suckling calf, while they are not so obviously appropriate to this area, have some justification. The goat is the canting type of Aegae, and may have a remote reference to Apollo, since in the legend of the coming of the Macedonian kings, the sunlight was their heritage and a goat

                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref> although its significance is uncertain, can plausibly be associated, as a member of the genus <hi rend="italic">bos,</hi> with the Apollo-Hermes group of types in this area.</p>
               <p>The remaining types which appear in the pattern on page 44 the Gorgoneion and Pegasus, are apparently intrusive (but cf. note 3). They may legitimately be considered together on the basis of their blood relationship. Medusa, and Pegasus, are so closely connected with Corinth that there is every likelihood that their use as cointypes in the north arose from the early connection of Corinth with the north. (Cf. Chapter I.) Likewise, some significance may be attached to the fact that the Pegasus type is used on the tetradrachm, the denomination created to be used with the electrum, since the forepart of a Pegasus is one of the obverse types used on the eastern affiliates of the third group of electrum coins. The Gorgoneion appears on the electrum of the second group,<ref target="#CH3-n13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref> in a form stylistically earlier than that employed for coins in the Thraco-Macedonian area. Thus, their source may be either Corinth or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The pattern of type distribution indicates some sort of monetary convention among the issuing agents. The survey made possible by <persName>Svoronos'</persName> collection of material reveals that obverse types were constant for certain denominations, whoever issued the coins, and that some tribes (e. g., the Orrheskians) issued inscribed coins in all three major types in some, but not all, of the denominations devoted to those types. From the extant coins there is no evidence that any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> tribe used <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the denominations above the stater as well all <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the types. Some tribes apparently confined themselves to one
<pb n="48"/>
type and one denomination, disregarding the fractional pieces. The preponderance of coins with Dionysiac types makes them, at first glance, seem the more important. However, the restriction of these types to the staters, and the use of the other types in the larger denominations, can well be taken to mean that the metal was apportioned in fairly equal quantities among the types characteristic of the three divinities, and that commercial or other considerations determined the amount to be used in various denominations. This hypothesis perhaps is over-complex; the assumption that these "rude and barbarous" tribes were capable of establishing and enforcing any such ingenious monetary convention as this may be difficult to accept. Let it be remembered that modern ignorance of these tribes does not prove their barbarous estate. All the evidence of the coins themselves, the variety of types and denominations, the vigor of the art and its stylistic development, indicate that the issuing agents have long been under-estimated because of absence of information about them. It is quite possible that detailed study of the coins would result in considerable modification of the suggestions made here. Such examinations as has been possible shows clearly the absence of hazard and the presence of design in their minting.<ref target="#CH3-n14">

                  <p>This type is a survival of a favorite Minoan motif and appears also on other coins in the north which are not on the standard of the tribal coins.

Its use on tribal coins is always marked by the orientation of the cow: standing r., with head reverted; on coins of another standard, the direction is left. The type was used early by Corcyra, and in the fourth century by Carystus. It may be that a common motif, a familiar survival from a period of which the sixth century tribesmen knew little, was used because those worshippers of Apollo and Hermes interpreted the representation in terms of their own. religious beliefs.</p>

The type is of purely local significance, a canting type which may have given rise to the fictitious oracles (see Chapter I). The quadripartite linear square on the reverse shows the development common to coins of the Thraco-Macedonian area: the earliest examples (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 1) are rude and irregular; the latest are precisely formed (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 5-8).

                  <p>The eight staters on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I show the various stages through which these coins developed. The earliest had no symbol or letter in the field. If one judges from the style of the reverse, the technique of the obverse, and the coins of Acanthus, the first added symbol was the flower, possibly the Pangaean rose. Only with this symbol is the goat represented as advancing left, with head reverted. The next symbol was the dotted theta, which may have been intended to represent a stylized flower or a solar symbol, or both. It was followed by a circular theta with a dot in the center, an obvious technical

advance over the variety made by the drill alone. Then came the monogram <graphic url="NNM126_063.jpg"/> and, finally, the first two letters of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> name, in regular or reverse order.<ref target="#CH3-n20">

                     </ref> On the coins of Acanthus in Desneux' catalogue, his order of nos. 1-92, includes successively those with no symbol, the flower, no symbol, the flower, dotted theta, circular theta, pecten shell, and finally A or AKAN in the field. This group of coins he dates before 480/79; the next series, with AKANΘION on the reverse, he dates after that time, on the analogy of the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>., He places the earliest issue ca. 530 B.C., a date which is probably too low, although the paucity of specimens would seem to justify it were it not for the fact that the 92 die combinations include 88 anvil and 81 punch dies. In other words, there must be a great many missing die combinations.</p>
                  <p>Of the coins which he assigns to the years 480-450 (or possibly a little later, although he is uncertain about an interruption of Acanthian coinage following the promulgation of the Athenian currency decree), there are 23 combinations of 22 anvil and 21 punch dies: again many die combinations must be missing. To be ultraconservative and take the number of extant dies as a close approximation of the total used during the thirty (or more) years, the resultant calculation suggests that the life of a die was a little over a year. On that basis, the dies for coins, nos. 1-92 in his catalogue should cover a period not less than 81 years (the number of surviving punch dies) and the beginning of the coinage of Acanthus should be placed ca. 560. The exact time of origin of the whole series of Thraco- Macedonian coins is uncertain, but for stylistic, metrological and typological reasons it should be placed early in the sixth century, if not at the end of the seventh. The survival of so many (92) die combinations for the early Acanthian coins and the parallelism between the progress of symbols on those coins and on the goat staters are indications that both series of coins began well before the

                     </ref> Since we do not know the date of the accession of Amyntas, it cannot be said that he inaugurated the Macedonian coinage, or at what point he continued it if it had been begun before his time.</p>
                  <p>Turning to the latest of the goat staters, those with <graphic url="NNM126_062a.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NNM126_062b.jpg"/> in the field, we may conclude that they were struck after 498, the earliest probable date for the accession of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. Possibly those with the monogram <graphic url="NNM126_063.jpg"/> should likewise be assigned to that king. The whole series of coins, judged by published specimens, is rather small. It is questionable whether, on this account, one may argue that the monogram group is to be assigned to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>,even though there are so few surviving staters (and one of these plated!) with his own initials. The following list of goat staters and their fractions is not intended to be exhaustive; it contains only already published specimens in their relative chronological order. The larger proportion of surviving coins is in the monogram group, which may represent the issue of Amyntas. At all events, the indications both from the coins of Acanthus, where the floral symbol and the dotted or circular theta occur on so many surviving dies, and from the coins of Aegae, where nearly half the surviving dies are those of the monogram group, are that both series were begun before the middle of the sixth century. Beyond such an approximate date it is not possible to conjecture.</p>
                  <p>The fractional issues (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 9-12) of the same type as the staters, have most frequently two pellets which are surely marks of value, since the coins are diobols. One coin (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 11) has the dotted theta; there are a few others with the first two letters of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> name, always retrograde (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 12). The following is not a complete catalogue, but it should serve to indicate that the stylistic development of the goat staters is a close parallel to that of the tetradrachms of Acanthus.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>In the general survey of the types used in the north, those portraying a horse were considered as referring to Ares. Among them distinctions are to be made if one is to assign coins to their issuing agents. In addition to those coins which show the horse alone as type, those which have the horse and man together show three varieties. The first, which has two poses, occurs on octadrachms and fractions, the second on staters, and the third, also with two poses, on tetradrachms only. Scant attention has been paid to the difference of treatment and style in these types, and consequently careless attributions have been made.</p>
                  <p>The octadrachm type is always a horse with attendant holding the reins and two spears; in both poses, the frequent occurrence of a curious error is noteworthy: the attendant's legs are apparently detached from his body, or he is to be visualized as crouching behind the horse. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 1-4.) One variant of the type, which nearly always bears the Bisaltian ethnic, with curious letter forms, shows the attendant's upper body frontally, although his legs are in profile. (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 1-3.) In some cases, notably <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 2, the proportions of the horse are unnatural. The coins show extensive use of the drill and a general heaviness of musculature in both animal and man. The style of the coins improves considerably, culminating in the piece in the Hunter Collection (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 3) where the drill has been little used or its traces skilfully masked by reworking. The fractions of this type are illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 14 and 15. The other variant (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 4-6), which is never inscribed and which often shows traces of the caduceus as a brand on the horse's rump (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 5, 6), always has the attendant completely in profile to the right. The design is smaller than the other and fits well within its border; the absence of an inscription gives these coins an uncluttered appearance which is pleasing. The drill is used chiefly for decorative effect, since its marks are most often toned down by reworking at the joints, but left untouched for tail, border and exergual

line.<ref target="#CH3-n22">
                        <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                     </ref> The body and musculature of the man are less heavy than in the former variety and the proportions of the horse are in most cases more realistic. A curious exception is <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 6, where the horse's left foreleg is very badly done; this bears a close resemblance to an inscribed coin of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> bearing the same fault. (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 5.) The fractions of this variant are similar to the octadrachms (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 18).</p>
                  <p>The stater type (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 10, 11, 13) is that of a man subduing or mounting a horse, which may be facing in either direction. The horse is spirited, in contrast to the quiet horse of the octadrachms. He is slim and wiry; as he struggles against the restraint of his master, his legs are bent almost double. The man, bareheaded (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 10) helmeted (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 11), or wearing a hat (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 13),<ref target="#CH3-n23">
                        <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                     </ref> is clad in a short chiton; frequently, we see his back rather than his profile. The whole design is fine and sharp; the horse's mane has a pattern somewhat similar to the stylized mane of the second octadrachm variant. On the obverse, these staters bear the ethnic of the Ichnaians (if this be a name of a tribe rather than of a city), the Tyntenians, or the Orrheskians. The reverse of the first two have a wheel as type, one with four spokes, the other with six; the Orrheskian coins have a mill-sail reverse, or one quartered diagonally. The form of the horse on these staters recurs on coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> struck after 476.<ref target="#CH3-n24">
                        <hi rend="sup">24</hi>
                     </ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third type is that of the mounted warrior-hunter, occurring on tetradrachms and fractions. On those tetradrachms,<ref target="#CH3-n25">
                        <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                     </ref> which are inscribed Sermylia, or a variant thereof (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 12), the horse is like that of the staters in breed; he is, however, galloping along
<pb n="55"/>
vigorously while the rider brandishes his spear. The mane pattern is similar to those just described. The reverse is at first a rough incuse; on the later coins, the four-part incuse is curved to the semblance of a clover leaf within the lines. The obverse of the fractions, either a galloping riderless horse or one with a rider, may be seen on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 16, 17. The flower in the field of no. 16 is similar to that on the goat staters and on the coins of Acanthus. The other tetradrachms which employ the warrior-hunter type (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 7-9) in style, technique and design are very like the second octadrachm variant, in spite of the fact that the horse has a rider. The animals are in the same quiet pose, merely lifting a forefoot. These tetradrachms are never inscribed, but have the anonymous four-part linear square within the incuse on the reverse. A few dies are too large for the flans, as in the first octadrachm variant, but they are in the minority.</p>
                  <p>A comparison of these latter tetradrachms and the second octadrachm variant with the coins of Alexander shows clearly that they are Macedonian. Compare, for example, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> II, 6 and III, 5; II, 7, 8, and III, 3; II, 9 and IV, 11, 12. The spears may be held in either hand. When they are held in the outer (right) hand, the elbow is drawn back (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 7 and III, 1-4); when held in the concealed hand, the right arm is straight from the shoulder (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 8, 9, and III, 6). The <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, do not always continue the practice: cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 8a and 11a; but it is in evidence on the tetrobols, cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 23a-33c, as well as on the octadrachms. In spite of the fact that the horse and attendant type does not appear on <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> octadrachms before Group II (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VI and VII), the close association of the uninscribed coins with those of Group I is self-evident; it is also to be noted that the caduceus as brand, which appears on some of the anonymous octadrachms (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 5 and 6), occurs on some of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> octadrachms, e. g. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 5.<ref target="#CH3-n26">
                        <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                     </ref> That these coins are Macedonian rather than Bisaltian cannot be gainsaid; the fractional issues (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 18-21)
<pb n="56"/>
with types both of the octadrachms and of the tetradrachms, show their kinship to the larger coins here attributed to Macedonia and their lack of affinity to the Bisaltian and Sermylian coins (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 14-17). Their anonymity is disconcerting, for there is no apparent reason why the Macedonians should not have used the ethnic as the other tribes did.</p>
                  <p>Various factors indicate that these coins should be dated rather late in the series of tribal issues: the close similarity in style to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> first inscribed coins, the regularity of the quadripartite linear square on the reverse (not shown on the plates), and the absence of such stylistic development as is seen on the goat staters.<ref target="#CH3-n27">
                        <hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                     </ref> It must be concluded that Macedonia, though it struck its earliest coins (the goat staters) on the Thraco-Macedonian standard, did not join the monetary alliance of the tribes until rather late. The list which follows, and which lays no claim to completeness, has been arranged in the relative order of striking on the basis of style. The most that can be said from the coins is that on the Brussels coin (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 9) and the one in the <persName>McClean</persName> Collection, the obverses are very like the tetradrachms of Group I, and the reverses resemble those on the goat staters with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> initials.</p>

                  <p>There can be no doubt that the coins of Group I, struck after 480/79, which abandon the anonymity of the Ares-type coins just discussed, are not the beginning of <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> regal currency. In view of the initials of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on some of the goat staters, they cannot even be termed the first inscribed <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> regal issues. However, the date 480/79 is still to betaken as having some significance for <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> regal coinage, since it marked the freedom of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> from whatever form of restraint the proximity of the <orgName type="ethnic">Persians</orgName> imposed upon him. Therefore, it must be the terminal date of the two earlier groups.</p>
                  <p>The goat staters have been roughly dated from ca. 560 to some time after 498 (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi> pp. 50 and 51); further study of all the tribal issues in the Thraco-Macedonian area is necessary before any more precision is to be attained about this series of coins. In the case of the octadrachms, tetradrachms, and fractions attributed here to the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName>, one can be more definite. Their terminal date has already been given as 480/79 - which <hi rend="italic">may</hi> likewise be the terminal date of the goat staters, although the latter issue may have been discontinued somewhat earlier. In the fragmentary history of Macedonia as we know it, two dates may have some significance for the
<pb n="58"/>
Ares-type coins. They are 514/3, the date of the first recorded embassy of the <orgName type="ethnic">Persians</orgName> to the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName>, the embassy executed through the ruse of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>,<ref target="#CH3-n28">
                        <hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                     </ref> and 492, the time of the first expedition of <persName>Mardonius</persName> to Thrace in preparation for the invasion of Darius.<ref target="#CH3-n29">
                        <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                     </ref> The activities of the <orgName type="ethnic">Persians</orgName> in the Thraco-Macedonian area must have inclined those tribes which had long been party to the monetary convention to a greater common effort. When the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName> came in contact with the <orgName type="ethnic">Persians</orgName>, inamicably, as we see from <persName>Herodotus</persName>, the occasion arose for them to unite to some degree with the other tribes, from whom they had hitherto held themselves aloof, except insofar as the goat stater and its fractions were based on the weight standard used by the tribes. When suddenly the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName> began using Ares-type octadrachms,<ref target="#CH3-n30">
                        <hi rend="sup">30</hi>
                     </ref> tetradrachms and their fractions, it is safe to conclude that a common military danger had compelled them to participate in an alliance of which the only historical record exists in the coins themselves. Between the two dates, 514/3 and 492, the probabilities incline toward the latter. The chief indication is the close similarity of style between the anonymous coins and those of the first group signed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, which would preclude the hypothesis of a long period of striking these coins. The fact that some of the goat staters bear <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> initials shows that they were struck later than 514/3, since <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was not ruling so early. The military danger was not so great in 514/3 as in 492, when some <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName> were enslaved by <persName>Mardonius</persName> in the course of his subjection of territories in the path of the Great King. <persName>Mardonius</persName>' defeat
<pb n="59"/>
at the hands of the Bryges of Thrace may mark the first united activity of tribes in that area: the monetary alliance had become a military one. The circumstances surrounding Macedonian participation in the alliance provide ample reason for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> choice of Ares- types. It therefore seems logical to suggest that the anonymous <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins were struck between 492 and 480/79. The goat staters may be dated in either of two ways: if <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> struck those with the monogram <graphic url="NNM126_063.jpg"/> (the series with the most dies known to me) as well as those with his initials, those with the monogram would date from his accession, 498, to 492; and those with his own initials would be contemporaneous with the anonymous Ares-type coins. If <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> struck only those with his initials, very likely they were struck between 498 and 492. In view of the fact that after 480 <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> suddenly emblazoned his name on the octadrachms and their fractions, and used the goat's head as a reverse type on some of his tetradrachms and <hi rend="italic">their</hi> fractions, I believe that he continued the goat staters during the period when he was also striking alliance coins. However, it may equally well be argued that he deliberately abandoned the goat staters during the period when he was working with the alliance to indicate his complete adherence with the tribes. At present, it is impossible to decide the date.</p>

                     <p>The Apollo-Hermes types all seem to appear on coins of an earlier period than the beginning of the fifth century, with the sole possible exception of those of Getas, king of the Edonians (cf. <persName>Gaebler</persName>, <hi rend="italic">AMNG</hi>, pl. 27, 29. The caduceus symbol (cf. <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, n. 26) is used for a longer period. I believe that the choice of Apollo for the sole obverse coin type of the Chalcidic League is to be associated with the Apollo-Hermes type on the tribal issues, rather than that the choice was made because at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, the Chalcidians looked to Sparta instead of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>.

               <head>3. MACEDONIAN REGAL COIN TYPES.</head>
               <p>The illusion of great variety caused by a casual glance at the <orgName type="ethnic">Alexandrian</orgName> issues is dispelled by finding the roots of his coinage. The main type is that of Ares, similar to that used by other members of the Thraco-Macedonian monetary alliance; the caduceus (which is also used by <persName>Perdikkas</persName>) is the symbol of Apollo-Hermes (cf. note 28); the goat is the local canting type. Dionysiac types are not used, unless the very infrequent leaf as a symbol be a vine leaf (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 15a). One new element is added: the heavy tetrobols have as their reverse type the forepart of a lion. One thinks immediately of the impressive lions on the coins of Acanthus, of the monumental lions of Amphipolis
<pb n="60"/>
and Chaironeia, of coin types from Samos or Miletus, and of the various types of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref> and the lion in the Thraco-Macedonian area. If Ionian or Aegean types were to influence coins in this area, they should have done so a century before.<ref target="#CH3-n31">
                     <hi rend="sup">31</hi>
                  </ref> The monumental lions are much too late.<ref target="#CH3-n32">

                     <hi rend="sup">33</hi>
                  </ref> is as yet unexplained. We know from <persName>Herodotus</persName> (VII, 125) that lions were common enough and bold enough to attack the camels of Xerxes' supply train in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, but that is scarcely a reason for using them as a coin type. Perhaps the best case can be made out for a connection with <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref>, for Heraklean types were used in the north during the period of the tribal issues; the legendary association of that hero with the area provided sufficient reason for it, particularly in the case of Abdera and Thasos. As regards the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName>, the position of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref> as ancestor of the Temenid house of Argos is a more valid source for the use of a type referring to him, since the locale of Heraklean exploits in the north was beyond the sphere of Macedonian influence. The king's efforts to be recognized as <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> might well include this allusion to <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref> on his coins. It should be observed that the types of <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins after 480/79 are exclusively regal; the ethnic is never used. The comparative anonymity of the lion is not relieved until the end of the fifth century, when <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref>' club, quiver and bow appear as a reverse type on a few of <persName>Perdikkas</persName>' fractional issues (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, f, with <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref>' head as obverse). In the fourth century, the lion is accompanied by a variety of Heraklean types and symbols.</p>

               <head>1. MINT TECHNIQUE</head>
               <p>Before a discussion of the coins, their arrangement, and their chronology, some observations may be made upon the technique and procedure of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> mint. These observations are culled from the various groups into which the coins have been divided and from the patterns of their die sequences. The die sequences for all groups are to be found at the end of this chapter.</p>
               <p>Whatever the method of preparing the flans, it seems not to have changed throughout the fifth century. There is no apparent variation in the size of the coins; there are no residual protuberances on the edges of the coins, such as serve to indicate that the flans were cast in a series of moulds; there is likewise very little evidence of insufficient heating of the flans at the time of striking, for the edges of most of the coins are quite regular. The slight difference in the sizes of the flans for the light and the heavy tetrobols indicates that mint officials were able to determine quite accurately the amount of metal necessary for coins weighing within a gram of one another. Where the coins in a comparatively few cases (see pp. 39-40) show very irregular weights, I should prefer to attribute them to carelessness in the selection of flans, rather than to inability to prepare them properly.</p>
               <p>The dies and their size and form may be reconstructed from the coins. In Group I (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> III-V), both dies are smaller than their flans and considerable care has been taken to center them in most cases. With the beginning of Group II, both anvil and punch dies increase in size, except those for the octadrachms (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VI-IX). Here, the border of the obverse and the corners of the incuse on the reverse are frequently off flan. There is evidence (see below Chapter VI) that in Group II other than <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> die-cutters worked in the
<pb n="62"/>
mint. It is impossible to do more than suggest that these outsiders were responsible for the change. Whatever its cause, once made the charge was permanent. There is an apparent exception in the case of the heavy tetrobols: these were not struck in Group II, and the few specimens which remain in Group III do not show much increase over those of Group I. However, the heavy tetrobols of Group IV, struck by <persName>Perdikkas</persName>, show an increase in the size of both dies (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XIII-XV).<ref target="#CH4-n1">

               <p>
                  <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins exhibit a phenomenon which, so far as I can ascertain, is not characteristic of other ancient coins and which is to be explained partly by the design and construction of the dies and partly by the size of the dies in relation to the flans. Because of the pressure applied directly to the punch in the ancient method of striking coins, in most issues more punch than anvil dies are necessary. The opposite is true of these <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins: there are more signs of die damage on the obverse than on the reverse, most often beginning at the edge of the die. The obverse dies are in much higher relief than the reverses, in each denomination; the punch itself was considerably larger than the die contained in it and flat, rather than beveled away from the die.<ref target="#CH4-n2">

                  </ref> The actual size of the punch cannot now be discerned, for its edge is not visible on any of the coins catalogued here. In some cases, one can make out the edge of the anvil die, which
<pb n="63"/>
seems to be very little larger than the border of the design. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 2, left side, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 48a, upper left.) These are both octadrachms, which were the only coins not to show an increase in the size of the anvil die. In the other denominations, the anvil die is so much larger than the flan that part of the design is left off. These technical details indicate that the pressure of the blow from the hammer would fall not only on the rather shallow die, but rather on the whole large area of the punch. In the case of the obverse dies, some of the pressure would fall on the die itself, outside the edges of the slightly smaller flan. Since the higher relief of the die rendered it the more fragile originally, direct pressure without the flan to act as cushion would make it suffer damage. This is not to imply that no punch die shows signs of damage; some do so, and that fact has been noted in the catalogue. Several punch dies, notably T P 17, (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 62b and 63a) and H P 26e (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV, 216-218) show signs of an original miscutting and of use with more than one anvil die without either repair or damage. The example on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, of a goat type reverse, which is in the highest relief of any reverse type, is a good illustration of the salutary effect of the pressure distribution over a punch larger than its die by which the life of these punch dies is prolonged. The following list of known dies shows how constant is the larger number of anvil than punch dies.</p>

               <p>From this chart, it will be seen that there are fewer octadrachm obverse dies (the only ones which did not increase in size) and only two more tetradrachm obverse than reverse dies. Since the extant die combinations in these denominations are so few (22 octadrachms and 28 tetradrachms) the evidence from the smaller denominations, of which there are many more die combinations, is more valuable.</p>
               <p>The pattern of die sequences makes it possible to draw some conclusions about <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> minting practices. In every group, in one or more denominations, three obverse dies are used with one reverse.<ref target="#CH4-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>In Group I, this arrangement occurs in the heavy tetrobols; in Group II, in the octobols and both series of light tetrobols; in Group III, in the tetradrachms; in Group IV, in both the light and heavy tetrobols. Without the appearance of this procedure in the case of the tetradrachms in Group III, it would not be possible to generalize; the manner of producing small denominations might well differ from that for large coins. The evidence, however, allows one to conclude that regular mint activity consisted in using three obverse dies, all probably set in one anvil,<ref target="#CH4-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> with one punch die. The fact that the octadrachms do not survive in sufficient numbers to show this procedure cannot be taken as a sign that it was not used in all denominations; so few octadrachms have survived that it is clear that we
<pb n="65"/>
know only a few of their dies.<ref target="#CH4-n5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> It is worth noting that the coins from Olynthus which immediately precede the League coinage, as well as the League tetradrachms and tetrobols, also show this use of one punch with three anvil dies.</p>
               <p>Elaborations of this pattern occur at two points in the series of coins, once under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, in Group II, where there are other signs of increased mint activity and once under <persName>Perdikkas</persName>, in Group IV, when the mint output is quadrupled. In Group II, the A series of light tetrobols (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 76-95) shows the use of one punch die with five, and another with six obverse dies. In both cases, some of the obverses are used with other punch dies; probably production was doubled by the use of twice the normal number of obverse dies. In Group IV, among the heavy tetrobols, there is a confusing pattern of seven punch dies in use at once, with at least eighteen obverses. Additional charts following the diagrams of die sequences at the end of this chapter show their ramifications. They are discussed in greater detail in Chapter VIII.</p>
               <p>The use of three punch dies with one obverse does not appear before Group II, where it occurs once in the octadrachms, nos. 49-51, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI (the obverse die shows hard use) and twice in the H series of light tetrobols, nos. 99-101 and 103-105, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX. In Group III, it occurs once in the heavy tetrobols, nos. 118-120; and in Group IV, once in the first series of light tetrobols, nos. 138-140, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, and seven times in the heavy tetrobols, nos. 176-178, 186-188, 189-191, 204-206, 221-226, 228-230, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XIII-XV. This is not the normal replacement of worn dies, as would be the case if one obverse die were used with two reverses, or vice versa. The absence of this pattern from Group I may be fortuitous, but its use may
<pb n="66"/>
rather be associated with the need for increased mint output. Group II shows various signs of abnormal mint activity. In Group III, the striking of heavy tetrobols is recommenced after a lapse of about fifteen years; a need may have been felt for more than normal quantities of them. In the light tetrobols of Group IV, the pattern appears at a time when that denomination was the sole product of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> mint. Of the seven instances of it among the heavy tetrobols of the same group, three are near its inception, when that denomination is struck again after a period of about twelve years; four are during the period when the mint was issuing great numbers of these coins. In the last series of <persName>Perdikkas</persName>' coins, there is no sign of it. Given the normal mint activity of three obverse dies with one punch, production would have been tripled when three punch dies were used simultaneously; presumably, that would indicate the use of nine obverses, although there is as yet no concrete evidence for it. The heavy striking of light tetrobols in Group II, when five or six obverse dies were used with one punch, and of heavy tetrobols in Group IV, when seven punches were used at once with at least eighteen obverse dies, points to very extraordinary demands for coinage at those times. In each case, the political situation will be seen to afford a reason.</p>

                  <p>The following system of numbering dies and their combinations has been adopted for the catalogue. On the plates, the catalogue numbers of the die combinations have been used for easier identification. Specimens marked * in the catalogue are illustrated. Die combinations have been numbered consecutively throughout the coinage of both kings. Thus, the first die combination of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> coins is no. 1, the first of <persName>Perdikkas</persName> no. 131. The fractional issues have not been given catalogue numbers, although they have been included
<pb n="67"/>
at the end of the Group with which they are to be associated, because the number of specimens of each type variety is very small and it is well-nigh impossible to determine the denomination of the coin, in most cases. The difference in weight between fractions associated with the tetradrachms and those with the octadrachms is so slight to begin with that nothing is to be gained by dissecting the very irregular fractional issues.</p>
                  <p>Instead of continuous die numbers from the first octadrachm to the last tetrobol, each denomination has its own continuous die numbers throughout the coinage of both kings. The preceding letter indicates the denomination, as:</p>
                  <p>OP 1 = first octadrachm punch die</p>
                  <p>OA 1 = first octadrachm anvil die</p>
                  <p>TP 1 = first tetradrachm punch die</p>
                  <p>TA 1 = first tetradrachm anvil die</p>
                  <p>HP 1 = first heavy tetrobol punch die</p>
                  <p>HA 1 = first heavy tetrobol anvil die</p>
                  <p>LP 1 = first light tetrobol punch die</p>
                  <p>LA 1 = first light tetrobol anvil die</p>
                  <p>SP 1 = first octobol punch die (special issue of Group II)</p>
                  <p>SA 1 = first octobol anvil die</p>
                  <p>This system seems better suited to the coins, since thereby the proportionate number of dies in the various denominations is readily apparent. It also seems better to continue consecutively with this numbering system in the catalogue of the coins of <persName>Perdikkas</persName>, since recommencing with HP 1 and HA 1 etc., might cause confusion in discussing dies.</p>

               <p>Details of die sequence in Group IV heavy tetrobols, Series 2, nos. 195-233.</p>
               <p>Beginning with no. 195 there is a period of abnormal mint activity, marked by a change of obverse type. The walking horse is supplanted by a prancing horse. Eight A dies of the walking horse type are used with seven P dies which are also used with ten prancing horse A dies. These latter A dies are also used with six other P dies, which are then used with other A dies of the prancing horse type. The dies involved have been numbered and lettered:</p>
               <p rend="hang">P 24, followed by a letter (a-g), is a die used with both styles of horse.</p>
               <p rend="hang">A 26, followed by a letter (a-h), is a walking horse A die used with a P 24.</p>
               <p rend="hang">A 27, followed by a letter (a-j), is a prancing horse A die used with a P 24, and in most cases with a P 25 (plus letter, a-h).</p>
               <p rend="hang">A 28, followed by a letter (a-g) is the next series of prancing horse A dies, used with P 25 (a-h) and with P 26 (a-b).</p>
               <p>The combinations with P 24 must be regarded as simultaneous, with an abrupt abandonment of the walking horse dies, since none of those dies (A 26 +letter) is worn. With the use of A 27 (a-j), more than the seven P dies used at the time of the shift are involved. The following charts show the interlocking dies at this point.</p>

Gaebler (<hi rend="italic">AMNG</hi> III, 2, p. 215, 69) is correct in his condemnation of the piece. A comparison between it and the genuine octadrachms on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III shows readily how "out of tune" it is with the others. The conscious archaizing of the musculature and eye is apparent; the die cutter used for the mounted man the frontal torso of the attendant on the Bisaltian coins (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 1-3). He erred in mixing two types. The reverse is betrayed by the form and arrangement of the letters, as well as by the kneeling goat which completely lacks the rude vigor of the goats on the staters. Traces of an earlier striking are faintly visible around the edges of the obverse, in the cast; an examination of the coin itself would be necessary to determine whether they actually are what they appear to be. It may be that the flan is ancient.</cell>

III, 11) is a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> specimen with rider left and goat's head right, wt. 10.30; the other is in the Empedocles Collection, same types, wt. 10.70. The reverse die is the same in both cases, but the obverses are different. The Empedocles coin is certainly plated; the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> coin, which is not listed by Babelon, looks as though it may be, though Gaebler does not say so. The weight would make it probable. The existence of plated coins of <persName>Perdikkas</persName> from official dies is known (see Group IV, light tetrobols, Series 4). In their case it has been possible to establish die identity with unplated coins; these tetradrachms are unique, although they are very like known dies. If these coins are forgeries, they are probably ancient ones.</cell>

Whether the coins appeared first after Salamis or after Plataea, it is impossible to determine. The sophisticated complexity of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> issues can only be the result of a carefully thought-out plan; his use of types and denominations shows clearly that neither the early staters of Aegae, nor his own octadrachms, tetradrachms and fractional issues in the monetary alliance (see Chapter III) were adequate for his purposes. In this first national coinage, three aims were embodied: (1) it was to be readily exchangeable with the most influential currencies of the Aegean area (see Chapter II); (2) it was to be readily recognized as Macedonian; (3) it was to be unmistakably a regal issue.</p>
               <pb n="86"/>
               <p>The coins themselves fall naturally into three groups, as an examination of the octadrachms on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> III, VI, and X will make clear. The smaller coins follow the style of the larger ones. Since there are no magistrates' symbols, or other means of ascertaining dates for these groups, the dates given below are not absolute in all cases. Historical lacunae make it necessary to rely on the coins themselves for information. The date of the end of Group I has been determined by the content of Group II, whose commencement is shown clearly by the coins to be 476/5. The date of the end of Group III is, of course, coincidental with the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. This is usually given<ref target="#CH5-n2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> as 454, but the coins indicate that he ruled some years longer, probably to 451. These then are the suggested dates for the coins of <persName>Alexander I:</persName>

               <p>Group I consists of four major denominations, two large and two small, in addition to fractional pieces whose weights are difficult to classify. The stater (9.82), with the obverse canting type of a goat, is no longer in use; its weight was unsuited to that of other currencies in the Aegean area. The coins struck are octadrachms, with a derived tetrobol, and tetradrachms, with a derived tetrobol. The weight norms for these denominations are:</p>

               <p>The various ways in which such coins could be integrated into other currencies have been discussed in Chapter II. The passing of the stater, the original one-hundredth division of the Babylonian common
<pb n="87"/>
mina on which all the Thraco-Macedonian tribal coinage was based, has been the source of the difficulty of classifying the weights of the fifth century coinages in the area. It had served its term of usefulness and was no longer to have a part in ancient commerce.</p>
               <p>Before discussing the types and their implications, it must be pointed out that the mass condemnation of the tetradrachms of this and subsequent groups by Gaebler<ref target="#CH5-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> cannot be endorsed. It is unnecessary to refute his arguments one by one. His misunderstanding of their weight has already been mentioned. His pronouncements on style and technique are unjustified on comparison of these coins with others in Group I, as well as with those tetradrachms immediately preceding it (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 7-9); his remarks on their color are not corroborated by such coins as I have been able to see. His theory that the reverse type of two of the light tetrobols (nos. 34 and 35, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V) provided a modern forger with models is a misinterpretation. The same Macedonian(s) did the work on all of these coins. A great many of these coins were collected by Rhousopoulos,<ref target="#CH5-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> some in a hoard or hoards, under circumstances which leave their authenticity unquestionable. In the catalogue these coins have been indicated by the insertion of Rhousopoulos' name as their source. Likewise the coins condemned by Gaebler have been indicated in the catalogue. No. 22 (a and b) lists two possible forgeries, one known to Gaebler; the defects of these coins have been discussed at their catalogue entry. Since Gaebler uses the same type of argument, equally unwisely, in his "exposure" of tetradrachms in Groups II and III, no further reference to his conclusions is necessary.</p>
               <p>While the denominations and the main outlines of the typological content of the coins had been determined upon at the time that the coins of Group I appeared, the actual type distribution among the denominations betrays some indecision at first. Combinations are tried out and discarded for others which, at the end of Group I, become
<pb n="88"/>
constant for the denominations and remain unchanged thereafter. The metrological relation of the heavy tetrobols to the octadrachms and of the light tetrobols to the tetradrachms is clearly marked by stylistic details. The obverse type of all denominations is from the Ares-type of the monetary alliance: horse, horse and rider, horse and attendant. In Group I all obverse borders are dotted; subsequently, the dotted circle is retained on the octadrachms and heavy tetrobols, while on the other two denominations it gives way to a linear circle. These latter show on both obverse and reverse an uncertainty of orientation which persists even on the coins of Perdikkas; the others do not.</p>
               <p>The reverses show plainly the conscious association of types with denominations. The octadrachms always have the king's name around a four-part linear square in the incuse. The heavy tetrobols, which introduced the lion type,<ref target="#CH5-n5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> attempted to carry the inscription of the octadrachms also. Fortunately, this attempt was soon abandoned (two dies are known <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, nos. 23-26), for of all the poorly executed lions of Group I, these are the worst. The design is small; the die- cutters were working with an unfamiliar type; the space available for the inscription was microscopic. The letters themselves are illegible on the first die (no. 23) and almost as bad on the second. The tetradrachms and light tetrobols, although they have different obverse types (the obverse of the tetradrachms is the same as that of the octadrachms and heavy tetrobols), share an uncertainty as to reverse type and both show a tendency to replace the dotted square by the linear, which is uniformly used on both denominations in the later groups.</p>
               <p>These reverse types reveal two different elements in <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> coinage. The goats, used first on the light tetrobols and then on the tetradrachms, were taken, in abbreviated form, from the staters; no inscription was necessary on a coin bearing this type. The helmets, first on the tetradrachms and finally on the light tetrobols, are new to Macedonian coins, but cannot be considered a new type since
<pb n="89"/>
many of the tribal issues had a helmet as symbol or reverse type.<ref target="#CH5-n6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> It is possible that this adoption of the helmet as a reverse type is proof that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> conquered at least one of the tribes which he has been credited with subduing and whose coinage he supplanted. The Orrheskians, among others, used the helmet as a reverse type; their staters have already been included among the Ares types having some similarity to the early Macedonian coins (Chapter III and <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 13). Nothing is known of their location.<ref target="#CH5-n7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref> They may have been a tribe incorporated into <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> kingdom, but of sufficient size and importance to have their tribal integrity preserved by the use of one of their types. The helmet continued as a reverse type through the coinage of Perdikkas on the light tetrobols. The goat disappeared finally at the end of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> reign when Perdikkas discontinued the denomination bearing it.</p>
               <p>Symbols are used only occasionally and with no evident purpose. The octadrachms show one anvil die with a leaping hound in front of the horse (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 5). This is the anvil die which appears to be by the same hand as one of the anepigraphic series (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 6). One hound, however, is not quite assurance that the rider should be called a hunter rather than a warrior. No. 4, an octadrachm, has a huge frog below the horse. It is without precedent and is never repeated. Its significance is unknown; though there are a few coins, of Aeginetan weight, attributed to an indefinite Aegean island,<ref target="#CH5-n8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> which have as type a swimming frog, it seems impossible to connect them with this coin. The same anvil die which has the hound also has a caduceus on the horse's rump. This symbol is a reference to the Apollo-Hermes type and had already appeared on some of the earlier, tetradrachms, also as a brand. It keeps recurring in various positions throughout the reigns of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> (as a reverse symbol on tetradrachms and
<pb n="90"/>
small issues) and of Perdikkas (as a reverse symbol on the heavy tetrobols). One tetradrachm reverse die (no. 15) has a leaf, also used on some fractions, below the goat's chin. It has more resemblance to an ivy leaf than to a vine leaf, and it cannot be associated with the flower which appears on the early goat staters and later on Perdikkas' heavy tetrobols. During <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> reign, the small coins have no symbols; in Group I, the first two punch dies for the heavy tetrobols and one anvil die for the light tetrobols have inscriptions or monograms. Types alone were considered sufficient for these pieces, as well as for the fractions. It is not until the time of Perdikkas, when there were no large denominations, that the small coins carried symbols. As Group I remains, it cannot be said that the symbols have any major significance; they afford no help in arranging or dating the coins.</p>
               <p>Even a cursory glance at <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> II, IV, V, shows the homogeneity of Group I, and, in the case of the large denominations, their immediacy of succession upon the octadrachms and tetradrachms of the anonymous coins attributed to the Macedonians.<ref target="#CH5-n9">
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </ref> The small pieces are the stylistic counterparts of the larger ones. A glance at <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VI-IX shows the marked difference in style of Group II. The arrangement of the coins in the various denominations within the Group is dependent upon factors that are susceptible of criticism; therefore, a justification of the methods employed to arrive at the present catalogue order is necessary.</p>
               <p>A. The octadrachms (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III) furnish no clue from the obverse to the order of their striking. The one die link (the A die of nos. 1 and 2) is of no value, since it may very well be that no. 2 is only another specimen of no. 1. The condition of the reverse is so poor that, while the legible portion is almost exactly similar to the reverse of no. 1, the condition of the rest makes it impossible to say that the die is the same. On the other hand, the letter forms and their arrangement on the P dies show changes which furnish some basis for their
<pb n="91"/>
sequence. P 1 (No. 1) has <graphic url="NNM126_104.jpg"/> for A and <graphic url="NNM126_104a.jpg"/> for P; both of these forms occur on tribal issues. P 3<ref target="#CH5-n10">
                     <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                  </ref> (no. 3) has <graphic url="NNM126_104a.jpg"/> for A, but P is regular; the A is tilted across the corner like the A on some Acanthus coins.<ref target="#CH5-n11">
                     <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                  </ref> P 4 (no. 4) has both A and P in regular form, but the initial A is tilted in the corner. P 5 (no. 5) has both A's and the Δ tilted in the corners (again, similarly to some Acanthus coins) and some granulation within the four-part square. P 6 (no. 6) has a fine regular inscription with no tilted letters; there is a trace of granulation within the square. It is logical to conclude that the order given here is close to that in which they were struck. The obverses are very little different from those on the anonymous coins; the die-cutters worked in accustomed forms. The letters were something new and the coins show some uncertainty until P 6 is reached. Here, the letter forms are as good as those in the next Group.</p>
               <p>B. The heavy tetrobols (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V) are the only coins in the group which arrange themselves with something approaching finality. As with the octadrachms, the evidence lies in the reverses rather than in the obverses, since the latter show little stylistic progress. The six punch dies show increasing ability on the part of the artists to master this new type, after the pathetic attempts to include the inscription. Die sequences, of which there are three, are marked by wear and the break in HP 6, which occurs after its first use in no. 31 and is greater in no. 33 than in no. 32. The order of this denomination can be regarded as secure.</p>
               <p>C. The tetradrachms and the light tetrobols (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> IV and V) are susceptible of two different arrangements: the one actually used in the catalogue and another that has been ignored because of the ambiguity of the evidence of the light tetrobols. The difficulty is caused by the duplication of reverse types in the two denominations; each uses both the helmeted head and the goat's head. The arrangement that has not been used would involve the simultaneous use, in both
<pb n="92"/>
series, of these two reverse types. Stylistically, this is quite possible; TP 1, TP 2, TP 3 (nos. 8-10) and TP 7 (no. 14) seem equally early, likewise TA 5 (nos. 12 and 13) and TA 12 (no. 21) are close in style. The fact that there are six TP dies with the helmet and seven and one half<ref target="#CH5-n12">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref> with the goat's head, taken in conjunction with the appearance of six punch dies each for the octadrachms and heavy tetrobols, hints that a figure near that number is the total for each denomination of Group I. Thus, there would be two series of tetradrachms, each equalling in volume the other denominations. Unfortunately, the lack of corroboration for this from the light tetrobols casts light on its validity. There, only one LP die (no. 34) has a goat's head, while all seven others have the helmet. Both types seem contemporaneous on both denominations.</p>
               <p>It is attractive to suppose that LP 1 is the sole survivor of a group of six or seven punch dies of that type, particularly in view of the seven helmet type LP dies. If that could be assumed, then there would have been two issues of both tetradrachms and light tetrobols in Group I. But such speculation is too dangerous; one must confine himself to the extant material. Therefore, the catalogue arrangement has been based on the fact that subsequent Groups show as standard types the rider r., and goat's forepart for the tetradrachms and the horse and helmet for the light tetrobols. The orientation of the riders on the obverse of the tetradrachms affords some evidence that the catalogue arrangement is correct: the obverses of the helmet series all face right; the earlier of the obverses of the goat's head series all face left. The last one (no. 21) which has the best goat's head, has the rider of the obverse facing right, a position which is unchanged thereafter. The catalogue order is admittedly unsatisfactory, since there is no conclusive evidence to justify either the arrangement used or the one discarded.</p>
               <p>The artistic skill of the makers of the dies of Group I has already been mentioned casually. It deserves some special attention, in view of the signs of vigor and ability of the artists. Their mistakes are as
<pb n="93"/>
revealing as their successes. There is no need to reproach them further for the first sorry lion reverses on the heavy tetrobols. One difficulty they never succeeded in overcoming (this is true even in Group III)<ref target="#CH5-n13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref> appears on those obverses where the rider is carrying his spears on the outside (that is, in his right hand if he is facing right, and vice versa). All their skill in differentiating planes and indicating depth was not sufficient to make the spears appear separate from the body of the horse; they curve around it in most unconvincing fashion. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 1, 2, 4 and 5, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 11). A touch of realism on those riders facing left appears in their costume. The chlamys normally was fastened at the right shoulder, thus leaving the right arm free for action; the artist remembered, in showing the other side, that the chlamys covered his left arm completely and he indicated the folds. On the dies where the rider is facing left, the spears are held in the right hand, which is free. This touch of realism raises the question how such a rider managed his reins (held in the left hand) and how the riders facing right, who hold the reins in the right hand, managed to keep both spears in the closely wrapped left hand. These artists never resort to the device used elsewhere (and in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> on the coins of <placeName>Archelaos</placeName>) of having the chlamys hang free from the shoulders to enable the wearer to use both arms.</p>
               <p>All the artists, and it is possible to distinguish the work of individuals, indulged in freedom in details: the angle of the horse's foreleg, the shape and size of the petasus, the length of the chlamys, and the pattern of its folds, are individual matters. One trait they had in common was the decorative use of the drill. The matter of the dotted borders has already been remarked. Dots are used for the exergual line, for the horse's tail, and sometimes for the edge of the lion's or goat's body. Some dies, notably the obverse of No. 5 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III) and of nos. 16 and 17 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV), show an incomplete masking of the original use of the drill along the upper part of the
<pb n="94"/>
outer hind leg of the horse. In most cases, however, traces of the drill are blotted out unless they are to serve as decoration.</p>
               <p>The helmets present peculiarities of detail. The form of the crest is different from that on most other coins; in fact, many helmets on the tribal issues have no crest at all. Such helmets as have been recovered from excavations in Thrace and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>
                  <ref target="#CH5-n14">
                     <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                  </ref> do not have crests. Their material is of course so much more perishable than that of the helmets that their non-survival is not surprising; it is in some cases impossible to tell whether the helmets recovered had a device to which a crest like that of the Macedonian could be attached. At any rate, the Macedonians had a crested helmet; it is not safe to call it either Corinthian or Attic. The shape of the bowl itself has its counterpart on sixth century vases,<ref target="#CH5-n15">
                     <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                  </ref> but the shape of the crest and its close attachment to the bowl can be paralleled only by some of the helmets used as a reverse type or as a symbol on some of the tribal issues.<ref target="#CH5-n16">
                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                  </ref> These helmets, as well as those of Group II, have a nose piece as well as cheek and neck pieces. The artists in all cases inserted a dot for the eye, although there is no other evidence that a helmeted head, rather than simply a helmet, was the type. There is no bit of the neck visible, either below or in the space between neck and cheek pieces. Since it is hardly conceivable that an eye shield was intended, the appearance of the dot for the eye may be considered a bit of archaic attention to detail such as is often evident on early vases.</p>
               <p>Since the period of Group I is precisely defined, between 480/79 and 477/6, the extant dies and their combinations furnish indications
<pb n="95"/>
of length of use of the dies. It will be remembered that in Chapter IV evidence was cited for concluding that normal procedure in the Macedonian mint involved the use of three anvil dies with onepunch. While many dies are lacking from Group I, particularly of the octadrachms, helmet series tetradrachms, and goat series light tetrobols, the survival rate of die combinations and specimens in the heavy tetrobols, the goat series tetradrachms, and the helmet series light tetrobols, makes it possible to draw some conclusions about the original number of dies in use and of the number of dies normally used per year in the Macedonian mint.</p>

               <p>The numbers six, seven, and seven and a half (the half indicates that a die was used first without a symbol and later recut with a symbol: possibly the number should be eight) for P dies and seven, nine, and eleven for A dies lead one to believe that nearly all the punch dies survive. For a period of four years, the rate of two punch dies would demand eight P dies for Group I; any other calculations would not account for the proportion of die combinations to extant specimens in Group I.</p>
               <p>If three A dies were used with each P die, the maximum number of A dies for the four-year period would be twenty-four; this would be the case if no A die was used with more than one P die. The die sequence charts (pp. 69-70) show, however, that this was not the case. Every series except the heavy tetrobols shows one A die link. Since
<pb n="96"/>
three A dies were in use at once with one P die, the minimum number of A dies for the four-year period would be twelve; eleven of the number survive in the heavy tetrobol series, which is the only series not to show A die links. Therefore, the number must be fifteen, eighteen or twenty-one A dies for the four-year period. Fifteen would not be sufficient to compensate for the lack of A die links in the surviving heavy tetrobol combinations; twenty-one is an unnecessarily large figure - possible but larger than survivals from this Group or any other warrant. It seems reasonable to posit eighteen A dies for this four year period, making the life of the three A dies used at one time about two-thirds of a year.</p>
               <p>The two series of tetradrachms present as great a problem in this connection as in the matter of their arrangement. There are enough surviving P dies in each to lead to the conclusion that both series were being struck at the same time, and the total number of A dies is only one more than in the heavy tetrobols. Unfortunately, the only A die links (see p. 70) are within each series, not between them. Here, the question of wear on the dies has some bearing. Nos. 12 and 13 use the same A die. In the first specimen of no. 12 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV), the beginning of a break at the right foreleg is barely visible; in the second (wt. 10.80) there appears to be repair on the coin itself, a cutting away to sharpen the outline of the leg to such a degree that the weight of the coin has been affected. In no. 13 (not illustrated), there are three specimens, showing an increase in the size of the break at the forefoot and another at the tail. The P die used in no. 12 shows no sign of deterioration in either specimen; therefore, the P die used in no. 13 was not a replacement for a worn die. Much the same facts appear from an examination of nos. 16 and 17a (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV). There the anvil die shows no more wear in one than in the other; the order of striking could not be determined if the P die of no. 17 were not that of no. 16 with the caduceus added. In the five specimens of no. 17, the P die shows progressive wear at the edges of the incuse and linear square and the sharpness of the outline of the A die is reduced after no. 17a. It is conceivable that the six (?) missing anvil dies for the
<pb n="97"/>
tetradrachms would provide links between the two series to show that they were struck simultaneously, for a year or two at least.</p>
               <p>The light tetrobols have only one surviving goat's head reverse die, which makes it rash to believe that the two series in this denomination ran concurrently, even though they may have done so in the tetradrachms. Until more dies turn up, the arrangement of the two denominations must be left uncertain; there is no conclusive evidence pointing in one direction. At least it can be said that in the helmet series of light tetrobols and in the heavy tetrobols, a total of eight P dies and eighteen A dies was used for the four years; the same is probably true for the tetradrachms and may be true for the octadrachms, although here few anvil dies survive.</p>
               <p>One other factor must be taken into consideration: the relation of the weights of the coins to those of communities with which <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> came in contact. In the Thraco-Macedonian area, the weights of his coins were the same as those of other issuing agents. Greece proper, with which he sought to unite himself during the Persian Wars and with which he hoped to cooperate subsequently, had no coinage with which the octadrachms (wt. 29.46) were readily exchangeable. It may be that a smaller number of coins of this denomination was struck. The tetradrachms exchanged with Attic tetradrachms at the rate of four to three (13.08 × 4 = 52.32 and 17.44 × 3 = 52.32), a heavy tetrobol and a tetradrachm together equalled a Chian-Rhodian tetradrachm (15.52) and the light tetrobol was exactly equivalent to an Attic tetrobol. Therefore, the numbers of coins struck in all but the largest denomination would be consequent on a far larger trade potential than would the octadrachms.</p>

               <p>There are a number of small coins of various recognizably Macedonian types which are of the same fabric and style as the catalogued pieces in Group I and must therefore be considered a part of that Group. The main varieties are illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, a-e. All but

one have the anonymous four-part linear square in the incuse on the reverse; one has a goat's head right. The first four might be considered as belonging in the period of the uninscribed Macedonian coinage discussed in Chapter III, and, indeed, there is no certainty as to their date, except that they cannot be later than Group I. All obverses show a horse, its forepart, or its head in a dotted circular border. The small size of these coins makes it almost impossible to say that they are or are not stylistically contemporaneous with Group I, since we have already noticed the close similarity in style between the uninscribed earlier octadrachms and tetradrachms and those of Group I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, a and e, are particularly nondescript.</p>
               <p>It is well-nigh impossible to give a name to the majority of these fractions, or to assign them to the standard of the octadrachms or the tetradrachms, for two reasons: (1) The extant weights have no correspondence with the types, and (2) the original difference in the norms is in itself very slight. Given ancient irregularities of striking, one cannot distinguish denominations. The norms are as follows:</p>

               <p>The weights of the coins illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V are: a, .46; b, 2.22; c, 1.03; d, 1.05; e, .85. It will be noticed that b could be a light tetrobol, or even a heavy tetrobol, for the list appended at the end of Chapter II shows some specimens of both denominations which weigh less than <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, b.</p>
               <p>The types do not afford a criterion for determining denominations. The difference in weight between b and c - more than a gram - although both coins have the same type, makes it difficult to believe
<pb n="99"/>
that they were intended to represent the same value. It might be conjectured that b is a light tetrobol of the period before Group I, but the style of its reverse is finer than most of the coins of that time. The forepart of a horse on the obverse of d contradicts its weight, by which it should be the same denomination as c, possibly the diobol on the tetradrachm standard, but such a conclusion leaves out of account the difference in type. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, d and e, both with the forepart of a horse, should be fractions of something - of a light tetrobol and a light triobol? But here again is a duplication of obverse type of coins of two different denominations. The reverse type on e, the forepart of a goat, is stylistically contemporaneous with the tetradrachms (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV) and one light tetrobol (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, no. 34) of Group I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, a, wt. .46, is obviously an obol, but with the difference in the norms only .07, it is impossible to say <hi rend="italic">which</hi> obol this coin is intended to be.</p>
               <p>There are other coins, as yet unassigned, which have the forepart of a horse on the obverse and a kneeling goat on the reverse (Gaebler, <hi rend="italic">AMNG</hi> III, 2, pl. XXVII, nos. 2-5) and one (pl. XXVII, no. 6) with the same type of goat on the <hi rend="italic">obverse</hi> and horse's forepart on the <hi rend="italic">reverse.</hi> The weights range from 1.00 to 1.78. These coins may be Macedonian, struck ca. 492 when the Macedonians under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> joined the tribal alliance against the Persians. It is as difficult to determine their denominations as to explain the reversal of obverse and reverse types.</p>

               <p>The knowledge that we possess of the kingdom of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> after the defeat of the Persians is very scanty, actually not so much knowledge as inference. The events of the "Pentecontaetia" as recorded by Thucydides<ref target="#CH6-n1">

                  </ref> do not include any action by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, but, since the locale of the earliest action of the Delian Confederacy, the reduction of Eion by Cimon, is close to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, we may be sure that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was concerned in it. Remembering the king's words to the Athenian generals when he came secretly to them on the eve of the battle of Plataea,<ref target="#CH6-n2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> we can imagine the eager anticipation with which <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> awaited the arrival of the Athenian fleet. Plutarch<ref target="#CH6-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> is the only ancient author to mention <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in this connection; he says that one of the charges against Cimon in 461 was that he had been bribed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> not to seize <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> when he drove the Persians out of Eion. A nice bit of calumny which arose out of events some ten years later than the time to which it was assigned.</p>
               <pb n="109"/>
               <p>The coins given here as belonging to Group II show first the alacrity of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to assist the Athenians and later his determined opposition to them when in 466/5 they made their first attempt to found a city on the site of the later Amphipolis. The changes in denomination, type and style of the coins show that Group II began as an issue designed (a) to exchange readily with Athenian currency, (b) to rally the moribund, if not defunct, tribal alliance to work with the forces of the Confederacy, and (c) to provide an earnest of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> membership in the Hellenic race. A little less than ten years after these changes were made, they were modified in a way that reflects the disillusionment of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> about the aims of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>.</p>
               <p>a. The change in denomination was a simple one: for the heavy tetrobols (2.45) was substituted a unique issue of octobols (4.36). This substitution made the exchange between Attic and <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> currency a simple affair, for the octobol was the equivalent of an Attic drachma,<ref target="#CH6-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> the light tetrobol was in weight an Attic triobol, and the tetradrachm of 13.09, of the worth of three Attic drachms. The octadrachms, which were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> readily exchangeable with Attic currency, were nevertheless retained, even though their fraction, the heavy tetrobol was intermitted. The reason, I think, is not far to seek. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> needed to make purchases in the north, possibly of supplies for the Athenian fleet, for which he would need the large denomination in the currency of the region. All the smaller coins struck were, of course, a part of the <orgName corresp="#nomisma_thraco-macedonian" type="ethnic">Thraco-Macedonian</orgName> system,<ref target="#CH6-n5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> but they were also Attic in weight. As we do not know the rate of pay at that time for Athenian troops,<ref target="#CH6-n6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> we cannot assume that the light

tetrobols (an unusually heavy issue) and the octobols were designed to help Cimon meet his payroll. It is obvious, however, that these small pieces, as well as the considerable variety of fractional issues (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, a-e) would facilitate trade by the troops with Macedonian χαπήλοι.</p>
               <p>b. The changes in type, which are in a measure consequent on the change in denomination, are significant of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> interest in the earlier tribal alliance, which had turned military in 492.<ref target="#CH6-n7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>I. The type of the octadrachms is once again the horse and attendant of the anepigraphic octadrachms issued in the late sixth (?) and early fifth centuries. At least one Bisaltian octadrachm of the same type (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 3, from the Hunterian Collection) must be dated by its style to this same time.<ref target="#CH6-n8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> The retention of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> name on the reverse shows that he was not merely a participant in the alliance as he had been earlier, but its leader. 2. The tetradrachms, whose type shows no change beyond the substitution of the goat's forepart for its head, have the initial of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> name added to the obverse, at the exergual line, half-way through the series as it now remains. 3. The type of the octobols, obverse and reverse, is the same as that of the octadrachms. This is a major change, for the octobols are metrically related to the tetradrachms, not to the octadrachms. It will be remembered that in Group I (cf. pp. 87-88) the types tended to emphasize the metrological variants. Here, the variants are linked by type. 4. The light tetrobols, while retaining the type which became fixed before the end of Group I (horse-helmet), form two separate series marked by divergencies of style. One series has the letter A above or
<pb n="111"/>
below the horse on ten of its anvil dies. Five of the other six anvil dies are linked by punch dies with the monogram dies; the sixth shows by its style that it belongs in the A series (A 19, no. 86). The other series has the letter H on five of its anvil dies; the remaining three are linked to them by punch dies. The horse itself on the H series, is not a Macedonian horse (see p. 114). The combination of the "foreign" horse and the letter H, which is hard to connect with Macedonia,<ref target="#CH6-n9">
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </ref> are additional indications of the more than national significance of this group. The intermission of the heavy tetrobols leaves their reverse type, the forepart of a lion, unused in Group II. Since this is the only type used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> which did not have a place in the tribal issues,<ref target="#CH6-n10">
                     <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                  </ref> its absence increases the "international" purpose of the Group. The strictly national, or regal, nature of Group I has thus been altered in two respects: (1) exchange with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was facilitated and, (2) emphasis was placed on those types which had more than national meaning.</p>
               <p>c. A comparison of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> III, IV and V with <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VI, VII, VIII, and IX will show clearly the great improvement in style in Group II. Since the group follows immediately upon Group I, the change must be due to a fresh artistic impulse for the origin of which it is natural to look to the south. The greater skill in the execution of the dies is more readily apparent on the octadrachms and tetradrachms. The smaller denominations do not offer quite the scope for beautiful work; the changes, while marked, do not result in such splendid improvement as on the larger pieces. While the interpretation of stylistic change, or variation, is very subjective,<ref target="#CH6-n11">
                     <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                  </ref> it is possible to identify the work of southern artists on some dies. Since the reverses
<pb n="112"/>
of the octadrachms offer an opportunity for little more than fine letter cutting, the obverses only need be considered. No. 45 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI) is probably the best and has been put first for that reason. The proportions of horse and attendant are well calculated; their poses are relaxed yet alert; the head (of the attendant), hair and petasus, as well as the upper part of the chlamys, show a skill which is entirely lacking on the octadrachms of Group I. The horse is sleek and subtly modelled, very similar in its restraint and anatomical simplicity to the handsome and spirited bronze horse in the <orgName>Metropolitan Museum</orgName>, dated between 490 and 480.<ref target="#CH6-n12">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref> Details of mane, hooves and muscles show a close relationship. On the coin, the composition is perfectly adjusted to the available space. Unfortunately, the only specimen is marred by a deep slash at the left side, but the beauty of the piece is still unmistakable. The other octadrachms, except no. 46 show the influence of this one, which surely was made by a Greek, probably an Athenian die-cutter. The smoothness of the musculature, the simplicity of modelling, and the composition of nos. 47-57 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VI and VII) are witness to the ease and speed with which <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> die-cutters learned new methods. It is chiefly in the stiffness of the heads of horse and attendant, in the awkwardness of the bunched folds of the chlamys at the neck, and in the proportions of the petasus that these anvil dies fall short of the first one.</p>
               <p>The obverses of thetetradrachms (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX) show an improvement over those of Group I (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV) comparable to that of the octadrachms, but there is no anvil die demonstrably superior to the others. As will be seen below, one of the octobol dies enjoys this distinction, which fact leads to the conclusion that an Athenian (or, at least, a Greek) artist made one large and one small die as a model for Macedonian workmen. Every coin in Group II shows this diecutter's influence, for all the dies are marked by a smoothness and "polish" which actually enhances the vitality already evident in the heavy, rather clumsy, horses and riders of Group I. Since Group II follows immediately upon Group I, the improvement cannot be con-
<pb n="113"/>
sidered as having its source in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, particularly because of the rather slight advance of the coins of Group I over those of the period just before it, when the Macedonian coins were struck; compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> II and III and contrast them with <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VI, VII and IX. The reverses of the tetradrachms, with the forepart of a kneeling goat, are much more elegant than those of Group I, although, as in the case of the obverses, there is no one die of marked superiority. There is every possibility that one will some day be found, to show that a southern artist made a model for this type also. TP 17, used with two different obverses (nos. 62 and 63, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX) was originally miscut at the left side, but seems to have suffered no subsequent damage in use. There are five specimens of no. 62, among which none shows the A die badly worn; it would appear that TA 17 and TA 18 were in simultaneous use and that the miscut TP 17 was used because of the necessity of heavy striking in this series; production could not be held up while a better die was being cut.</p>
               <p>An examination of the light tetrobols shows an advance in style over those of Group I similar to that of the other series, but as in the case of the tetradrachms, there is no anvil or punch die (with the possible exception of LP 22) which shows clearly that it was made by a southern artist. The reverses show a marked variety in the shape of the helmets, which retain the nose piece shown in Group I. In general, it may be said that the chief change is in the elongation of the cheek piece, although one P die in the earlier Group, that of nos. 39 and 40 (facing 1.) anticipates this lengthening. Likewise, in most cases, the bowl is more sharply differentiated from the remainder of the helmet. The helmets themselves retain the close-fitting crests which seem to be exclusively northern; the articulation of the members may possibly represent (at least in some cases) an interpretation of the northern helmet by southern artists, or the form of the helmet itself may have undergone some modification at this time. One LP die, that used on the last coins of the H series (no. 107, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX) deserves special mention. Here, a head, with the neck visible below, is shown in a helmet with a most peculiar crest, curving
<pb n="114"/>
below the base of the neck. The die is of singular beauty and has no affinities among the reverses of the other light tetrobols. It does not recur in subsequent groups. This may have been the one die where a southern artist used a type of helmet, fanciful or otherwise, which pleased him as an artist, instead of modifying the regular type.</p>
               <p>While the horses of the A series of light tetrobols call for no comment beyond the mention above of their advance in style over those of Group I, those of the H series are in a special category. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX). They are a slim, wiry breed of horse, not at all like the stocky or rangy horse which is customary on <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins, with the sole possible exception of No. 44 in Group I (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V). Even here the similarity is not great. When in motion, and motion beyond the tentative raising of a forefoot is not characteristic of the horses on <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> coins, these horses spring forward in a manner that cannot be described as either prancing or galloping, since all four legs are angularly bent, the foreknees almost touching the chin. On the much later tetrobols of <persName>Perdikkas</persName>, when the regular Macedonian horses start prancing (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XII, 163, 164, 166-9, XIV, <hi rend="italic">passim,</hi> and XV), then galloping (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 170-175), they do so in the manner one expects of a horse; these are quite different. Although the action is more violent, the horses themselves bear a close resemblance to those on the earlier staters of the Ichnaians, Orrheskians and Tyntenians (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 10, 11, 13), in pose and proportions. These coins have already been discussed in Chapter III. Their archaic style is not in evidence on these light tetrobols; the advance in technique is comparable to that of the remainder of Group II. The horses are so different from those on the A series of the same denomination that the one unlinked, anepigraphic, obverse die (that of no. 86, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII) automatically takes its place in the A series because of the style of the horse.<ref target="#CH6-n13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>The style of the octobols (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII) is very like that of the octadrachms. Nos. 66-68 may well be from a die cut by the artist of the octadrachm, no. 45. There is the same easy pose of both animal
<pb n="115"/>
and man, the same slight forward tilt of the man's head, and the same soft folds of the chlamys at the neck. Nos. 69-72 are more like the octadrachms nos. 47-57, showing a smoothness of modelling, but a certain stiffness of pose. The A dies of the last three octobols, nos. 73-75, present a peculiarity which must be taken in connection with the two octobols illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, a and b, and the octadrachm no. 46. The latter two octobols have their obverses from the same die; one reverse has the Bisaltian ethnic, the other has the name of Mosses.<ref target="#CH6-n14">
                     <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>This group of A dies has the lower part of the attendant's chlamys visible below the body of the horse. All three (SA 7, SA 8, and that of the two on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, a and b, have various slight differences: that of those on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI has a small attendant, with a rather long-bodied horse; the composition is not so well fitted to the field. That of no. 73 (SA 7) is the only die either of the octobols or the octadrachms where the attendant is taller than the horse, although the composition as a whole is better than that of the preceding die. The die of nos. 74 and 75 (SA 8) is the best and was, I believe, made by a foreign (southern) artist. It has the
<pb n="116"/>
feature that was imitated on the octobols just mentioned, the chlamys hanging below the body of the horse, but it has a refinement which was not appreciated by the imitators. The horse is standing perfectly still; on the small compass of the octobol, this is a neater pose than the one suitable to the octadrachm, where the horse has his left forefoot raised. There is some question whether the arrangement of the octobols is justifiable, since the dies with the long chlamys, one possibly by a Greek, are put last. My confidence in the rapid response of <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> die-cutters to outside influence leads me to prefer this arrangement on the ground that the native artists would soon have seen effectiveness of the standing horse and would have made their dies accordingly. Since there is no wear on any of the linking P dies, the order could be changed, but there is no tangible, incontrovertible proof for either arrangement.</p>
               <p>The octadrachm, no. 46, which is out of place anywhere in its series, looks like an attempt by a die-cutter who had more courage than skill to reproduce this type variant, for it is closely modelled after the die of nos. 74 and 75. It stands out among the octadrachms and has no compeers among the tetradrachms; its oddness is further emphasized by the fact that the spears are reversed. There is not the slightest reason for condemning the piece, which for all its awkwardness shows the vigor and originality always associated with northern artists, whatever their degree of skill.<ref target="#CH6-n15">
                     <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                  </ref> The arrangement of the octadrachms whereby this coin is placed second in the series may be questioned in view of the fact that the octobols to which it is similar are placed at the end of their series. It has been done because with the exception of no. 45 and it (no. 46), the octadrachms are the work of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName>, among which a little sequence dependent on the few linking dies is possible. Actually, it may be almost contempo-
<pb n="117"/>
raneous with no. 53, the last before the waning moon symbol is added. The chart of die sequences at the end of Chapter IV shows how little of this series remains; consequently, any arrangement depends on intangibles. In this case, it seemed better to isolate no. 45, which is surely not by a <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName>, and no. 46, which, although probably native, is quite unlike the others. If more coins come to light, a different order may be possible.</p>
               <p>Before considering such meager evidence as there is for the duration of Group II, the relation between the peculiarities of the group and the events occurring in the north should be pointed out. At the beginning of this chapter, reference was made to <persName>Cimon's</persName> attack on Eion in 476/5;<ref target="#CH6-n16">
                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                  </ref> there is no hint in Thucydides' abbreviated "Pentecontaetia" that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was consulted or even informed in advance of Greek plans. The clue pointing in such a direction is the A die of the octadrachm no. 45. Since this obviously influenced the makers of the other dies, it was placed first; it is hard to account for the presence of an Athenian (or other Greek) artist in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> at this time if <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was not transacting business with the Greeks and privy in their plans. So far as we know, the two regions were not in close contact with one another so early in the century; it looks as though the plan for the change in denominations and the importation of a southern artist were the result of some sort of planned cooperation between <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and the Greeks. In any case, whether these conclusions be justifiable or not - and if they are not, we have to assume that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> quite independently decided to be ready to work with the Athenians when they arrived - the coins themselves probably did not appear before Cimon and the fleet were in northern waters. Therefore, it is safe to date the beginning of the group in 476/5. This date (and, consequently, that of the end of Group I, 477/6) and that of the beginning of Group I in 480/79 are the only dates in the coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> which can be fixed with any degree of assurance. The date of the end of Group II is hard to define and both beginning and closing date for Group III are somewhat arbitrary, as will be seen in Chapter VII.</p>
               <pb n="118"/>
               <p>From the coins, it seems that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was reviving some portion, at least, of the old inter-tribal cooperation of the sixth century, which in the years of the Persian advance, notably 492 and following, had become a military alliance - probably only for defensive purpose. He succeeded in influencing the Bisaltians, the tribe over which Mosses ruled, the tribe represented by the H and the "foreign" horse, and possibly even the Edonians, to unite. These latter, who struck coins using the Apollo-Hermes types, lived a little above Eion on the Strymon (Thuc. I, 100); hence they would be concerned with Athenian action so near home. The probability of including the Edonians in the "alliance" is enhanced by the form of the letters on some of their octadrachms. These coins bear on the obverse the variety of the Apollo-Hermes type which shows two oxen and an attendant, who is presumably Hermes;<ref target="#CH6-n17">
                     <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                  </ref> the type is thus similar to the form of the Ares type used always by the Bisaltians, with the ethnic on the obverse, used without an inscription earlier by the Macedonians (see Chapter III), and only here with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> name. The form<ref target="#CH6-n18">

                  </ref> of the A in the inscription on the reverse ΓEΤΑΣ BΑΣΙΛEΟ[Σ] HΔΟΝEΟΝ is the one which displaced the <graphic url="NNM126_104.jpg"/> shortly after 479 on <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins and on various others in that area, and which is used on the coins of Acanthus, first inscribed at this time.<ref target="#CH6-n19">

                  </ref> The earlier coins of the Edonians likewise have the form <graphic url="NNM126_104.jpg"/>. It seems fair to conclude that Getas was a ruler of the Edonians contemporary with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, who took part in the renewal of the old alliance revived to give assistance to the Delian League when its contingents moved north.</p>
               <p>Some ten years after the liberation of Eion, the Athenians returned to the north to defeat the Thasians who had differed with them about the ownership of the mainland and the mines. Thucydides<ref target="#CH6-n20">

that at the same time the Athenians sent out 10,000 colonists from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and the allies to found a colony at Ennea Hodoi, on the Strymon, in Edonian territory. This action is generally dated in 465,<ref target="#CH6-n21">
                     <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                  </ref> despite the statement of Diodorus that it took place directly after the release of Eion. Thucydides concludes his brief account of the first attempt at colonizing Amphipolis with the statement that the Athenians, after conquering at Ennea Hodoi, went thence inland and were utterly defeated by all the Thracians at Edonian Drabescus. There is no doubt that this abortive colony at Ennea Hodoi was as unpleasing to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> as to the Edonians. Of course, his realm did not yet extend beyond the Strymon, and we may be sure that any plans he may have had for such an extension were not known to Getas, but for other Greeks to seize land so close to him was as bad as having Persians in the vicinity. He would have felt doubly insulted, for he claimed Greek ancestry and was accepted as a Greek at the great sanctuaries of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_delphi">Delphi</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>.</p>
               <p>It is of some significance that Thucydides, for all his brevity, mentions that the land was Edonian, but does not mention the king, and says that all the Thracians defeated the Athenians. In the first chapter, it was pointed out that the term "Thracian" and "Macedonian" were used rather indiscriminately by both <persName>Herodotus</persName> and Thucydides; thus the wording does not exclude <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName> from

participation in the conflict. This is the action of the revived tribal alliance, no longer cooperating with the Delian League, but opposed to its members. That <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was the prime mover is to be seen from the coins. The latest of his octadrachms (OA 13, 14, 15) carry in the upper left field the unusual symbol of the waning moon. This I take to be <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> way of making known his sentiments to the Athenians, who were at Thasos conducting a siege for two or three years after Drabescus. It was the symbol they had used to mark their defeat of the Persians, interlopers into their world.<ref target="#CH6-n22">

                  </ref> where the story of the charge of bribery is told. Plutarch states that when Cimon was accused of treason in 461, one of the charges against him was that he had taken a bribe not to invade <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> when he freed Eion. It can be conjectured that the Athenians, who felt keenly the defeat at Drabescus, willfully or otherwise confused the monetary assistance given Cimon by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and the tribes in 476/5, and presumably for some time thereafter, with the continued issue of alliance coins and the defeat at Drabescus. It is in a sense the confirmation of the hypothesis that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> led the coalition in 465, since there is no hint in the ancient authorities that the plans of the Athenians in 476 included the annexation of <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> territory.</p>
               <p>The terminal date for Group II is not readily apparent. I believe that the symbol on the octadrachms is to be dated after 465, but how much longer the issue lasted is quite indeterminable. The number of known dies, die combinations and specimens, and the die sequences cast no light on the matter. The die combinations are as follows:</p>

               <p>The evidence from this chart and from the die sequences (Chapter IV) shows how few remain from the two large denominations. Using as a criterion the proportion of three A dies to one P die (see Chapter IV), one can easily judge how large is the number of missing A dies. There is no clue to the number of missing P dies. If we add to this scanty die survival the circumstance that among the octadrachms one of the three links is that where one A die is used with three P dies (nos. 49-51), a sign of increased mint activity, it becomes clear that we have only fragmentary remains of a heavy issue. The fact that there are only two more specimens than die combinations is another indication that many dies or their combinations are lost. The rate of survival of the tetradrachms is somewhat better: there are eight combinations and eighteen specimens, but no significant links.</p>
               <p>The smaller denominations are better represented. The octobols are entirely linked, the links including two occurrences of one P die with three A dies. The rate of twenty-four surviving specimens for ten combinations is quite high. In the two instances where one A die is used with two P dies (nos. 66, 67, and 74, 75) none of the punch dies is worn, which may well mean that they were used simultaneously.
<pb n="122"/>
The H series of light tetrobols is almost as unrevealing as the two large denominations: an equal number of both dies and only three more specimens than combinations. However, the die links, with two instances of one A die used with three P dies (nos. 99-101 and 103-105), provide the series with almost complete linkage and furnish the same evidence of heavy striking as was indicated in the octadrachms. The A series of heavy tetrobols shows the clearest signs of heavy minting, and it may be that this issue, which provided convenient Attic change and which was stamped as <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName>, was more heavily struck than any of the others. Six P dies and eighteen A dies, twenty combinations with twenty-nine specimens, one P die used with five, and another used with six A dies, all indicate a large issue. The incongruity of the evidence is too great for any assumption that all denominations were struck in such quantities as the A series of light tetrobols, and the remains make it difficult to judge the length of the period during which Group II was struck.</p>
               <p>Possibly some such conclusion as this might be reached. In 476/5 the issue was begun with octadrachms (without the moon), tetradrachms (probably without the A), octobols, and both series of light tetrobols, the A series in larger numbers than the other.<ref target="#CH6-n25">

heard about Athenian plans for Ennea Hodoi, the issue of octobols ceased and the letter A was added to the tetradrachms. The Bisaltian octobols and those of Mosses probably ceased with those of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, since the need for that denomination had apparently never been very great in the north. The light tetrobols, even though they were the equivalent of the Attic triobol, had always been popular in the area, to judge from remains, and continued to be struck. After Drabescus (465), the waning moon was added to the octadrachms. The terminal date cannot be reached from consideration of such evidence as we now possess. The conjectured date of 460 is merely a suggestion, based partly on the small size of Group III. It is quite possible that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> struck no coins at all for some years following the waning moon octadrachms. When the Athenians retired from the north, after the subjection of the Thasians, the country may have been quiet and the currency already in circulation sufficient for local needs.</p>

The defeat of the Athenians at Drabescus in 465. 6. The subsequent siege of Thasos, its request for Spartan aid in 464, the Spartan promise and failure of fulfillment because of the earthquake and the revolt of the Helots in the same year. 7. The final capitulation of the Thasians in 463/2, their relinquishment of claims to the mainland and their inclusion in the tribute lists.</p>

                  <p>Information on that subject is extremely scanty at any period. We know that it was raised to three obols a day under Pericles, or a drachma if the troops found their own food. At how early a period pay for troops began is uncertain, but perhaps the levying of tribute from members of the Delian Confederacy was occasioned not only by the need for supplies, but also for the pay of troops who might in a sense be considered as mercenaries. There are some references in Thucydides to rates of pay during the Peloponnesian War.

                  <p>Bisaltian octobols of this style are rather rare. I have been able to find the one illustrated, from Naples, another in Klagenfurt (<hi rend="italic">AMNG,</hi> Pl. XII, 11), and a third in <placeName>Cambridge</placeName> (<hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>McClean Coll</persName>.</hi> II, 3105, Pl. 113, 8). The coin of Mosses illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI is in Brussels. Gaebler condemns all the Bisaltian octobols of this style: the one in Klagenfurt he lists as a forgery without explanation; the other two he dismisses (<hi rend="italic">Falsch.</hi> I, 195 ff.) as copies of the Mosses coin and claims that the reverses as well came from that coin, the forger having left the O of the Mosses inscription in that of the Bisaltian. I have not been able to examine the coins, but his arguments lack force. The Bisaltians struck octobols earlier (see Plate II) one of which (<hi rend="italic">AMNG,</hi> Pl. XII, 8, from <placeName>Berlin</placeName>) has the monogram <graphic url="NNM126_063.jpg"/> on the horse's rump. None seems to have been struck beyond the period of the revived tribal alliance in 492 except these listed here. The coins of Mosses, however, show a continuous development which sets them apart from the Bisaltian coins. For this reason, as well as because of the fact that it seems most unrealistic to assume that a ruler issued only small coins in his own name while issuing both large and small in the name of his people, the supposition that Mosses was a ruler of the Bisaltians is unwarranted. He may well have been one of those tribal chieftains mentioned by Thucydides (II, 99) who retained a measure of autonomy while paying tribute to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. A number of his octobols are illustrated in <hi rend="italic">AMNG</hi>, III, 2, Pl. XXVII, nos. 37-42.</p>

                  <p>This passage in Thucydides (1, 100), and another where reference is made to the first colonizing of the site in describing the settlement of Amphipolis in 437 (IV, 102) have been the subject of considerable discussion because of the ambiguity of the antecedent of αύτοί (1, 100) and οἳ (IV, 102). Who actually suffered defeat at the hands of the Thracians at Drabescus - the settlers, or Athenian troops from the scene of the siege of Thasos? Meritt-Wade-Gery-McGregor, <hi rend="italic">The Athenian Tribute Lists</hi>, III, pp. 106-110, explain the passages sanely, referring αύτοί in I, 100, and οἳ<hi rend="italic"/> in IV, 102, to the Athenians, after the defeat of whom the abortive colony at Ennea Hodoi was withdrawn. Following Isocrates (8, 86) both Walker, <hi rend="italic">CAH</hi>, V, 58, and Gomme, <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Thucydides</hi>, 1, 297, took it to be the settlers. That the military action, as contrasted to the attempted settlement, was undertaken by the military arm is, of course, only logical: Drabescus was at some distance from Ennea Hodoi; the settlers would have no occasion to stray so far inland. Further, Pausanias, I, 29, 4 states that a list of casualties on a stele was the first monument set up by the Athenians for military personnel, in 465/4. This stele is probably <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> I<ref target="#CH6-n2">

                     </ref>, 928, (cf. also <hi rend="italic">ATL</hi>, III, 259) and confirms the conclusion that the defeat at Drabescus was suffered by Athenian troops, not settlers from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and the other allies.</p>

                  <p>The two series of light tetrobols are unconnected by P dies. It is impossible to determine whether they were contemporaneous or successive one upon the other. There is no linking die between them, although the style of the helmet on the reverse of both series is quite similar. It seems best to consider them roughly contemporaneous, with the H series perhaps beginning slightly later, when the tribe represented by that series was brought into the alliance; the two series would subsequently be struck simultaneously.</p>

               <head>3. FRACTIONAL ISSUES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, a-e</head>
               <p>The fractional issues assigned to Group II are stylistically associated with that Group. Coin a on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX has as obverse type a horse very like those on the" A" series of light tetrobols such as <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, nos. 85-88. The reverse is a four-part linear square in the incuse, with an upright caduceus in the center. None of the other fractions in this group or in Group I has the linear square within the incuse, although the incuse is quadrilaterally divided. The weight of the coin illustrated is 1.99 and others of the same type weigh about the same. This probably should be classed as a triobol on the heavy standard (norm 1.83), but it is to be noticed that many of the light tetrobols in all groups weigh no more than this. In Group II, the only coins in the catalogue which are on the heavy standard are the octadrachms. It is rather surprising to find any small coins at all on that standard during this period.</p>
               <p>Coin b, which has a standing horse r., with a leaf above similar to that on the left on the reverse of the tetradrachm no. 15 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi>
                  <pb n="124"/>
IV), wt. .93, likewise appears to be on the heavy standard, a trihemiobol (norm .91), but since the light norm is .81 for the trihemiobol and 1.08 for the diobol, there can be no certainty about the denomination of this piece. Coin c, also a standing horse r., on the obverse, wt. 1.01, is probably the same denomination as b. It will be remarked that the coins here described show the same lack of association of a single type with a single denomination as was the case with the fractions of the first group.</p>
               <p>Coin d is the lightest of the fractions in this group, wt. .53, and is certainly an obol, although one cannot specify the norm. This is an interesting type of fraction, the head of a man wearing a petasus. It is probably not intended as portraiture, but rather as shorthand for the warrior-hunter or the attendant of the horse on the larger coins. The occurrence of a head as type on a coin is certainly no rarity, but if its use here has a fractional value, as does the forepart of a horse on other fractions, it is unique as far as I know. The work is neat, although the dotted border is rather heavy, and the four-part incuse on the reverse is as anonymous as ever. Another similar coin, which must lie outside the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> regal issues, should be mentioned. Unassigned, it has a head, wearing a petasus, and to judge from illustrations, it seems to be stylistically quite close to this coin, even in the matter of the rather coarsely dotted circle. The reverse, however, has an elaboration of diagonals and pellets within the four parts of the linear square which is quite foreign to the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> mint. It is best illustrated in G. <hi rend="italic">AMNG,</hi> III, 2, pl. 26, no. 17, wt. .43. It is conceivable, although incapable of proof, that this is a fractional piece issued by one of the tribes associated with the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName> first to aid the Athenians, then to hinder them. The source for the reverse type is unknown, although it could be taken as an elaboration of the reverse on the electrum pieces i and j on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I. So far as I know, it is not used again.</p>
               <p>The fifth fractional type on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, e, wt. 1.05, perhaps belongs in Group I, since the helmet on the reverse is very like those in that group. It is a light diobol or trihemiobol and may be contemporaneous
<pb n="125"/>
with <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate V,</hi> e. The obverse type is the same and both reverses, helmet and goat's head, had been associated in Group I with coins of the light standard, the tetradrachms and light tetrobols. Because the execution of the coin, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate IX,</hi> e, appears better than that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, e, it has been assigned to Group II.</p>

               <p>At the end of Chapter VI, the lack of any evidence for the terminal date of Group II was indicated and the year 460 was proposed as a working date. In the case of the coins that constitute Group III, literary evidence is completely absent regarding any events which might be connected with it, since even the date of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> death is uncertain. It is given as 454 and 451.<ref target="#CH7-n1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> Consequently, the coins themselves must be the sole source of any information regarding the closing years of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> life.</p>
               <p>A glance at <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> X and XI shows the changes in types and denominations from Group II, and some advancement in style. The latter is not so great as that which separates the two preceding groups from one another and cannot be taken to imply any new influx of outside talent;<ref target="#CH7-n2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> the changes in types and denominations are of
<pb n="130"/>
greater importance. The octadrachms again use the type of Group I (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III), the heavy tetrobols are struck in place of the octobols, using the types peculiar to this denomination, and the light tetrobols are anepigraphic, with the regular <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> horse only. These are strictly national and regal types; there are no tribal issues which compare stylistically with them, such as were struck in the time of Group II.</p>
               <p>The style of the group is quite homogeneous and the standard of workmanship high, except among the light tetrobols. The octadrachms, of which only four specimens survive, have the caduceus' head on the rump as a brand, except in no. 109 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X) and all but no. 108 have a dog below the horse. The one octadrachm in Group I with a dog showed a hound leaping up in front of the horse. Here, the dog is more like a Molossian, though smaller.<ref target="#CH7-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> On no. III, which is a masterpiece of the die-cutter's art, the dog is in much better proportion to the horse and rider than on the other coins. The tetradrachms all have anepigraphic obverses, but two P dies show some inscription. No. 112 has a unique P die, with the first three letters of the king's name in corners of the reverse. The goat's forepart is similar to those of Group II. No. 113, which used the same A die as no. 112, is the first to show the goat's head reverted, a change, but no real improvement in the composition. No. 116 (P 22) has a small A in the upper left corner of the linear square. The heavy tetrobols, whose obverse type is like that of the larger denominations,<ref target="#CH7-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> reveal the familiarity of the die-cutters with this type, even on the reduced scale necessary for so small a die, but likewise, on the reverses, show
<pb n="131"/>
the lack of practice in cutting the lion-forepart type, which had not been used for sixteen or seventeen years. These animals are far cruder than the others of Group III.</p>
               <p>The light tetrobols show vagaries of orientation; this never occurred in Group II and in Group I only on the reverse of nos. 39 and 40. The helmets are without nose-pieces and in some cases are rather carelessly cut: some helmets are too large for their square, and the cheek-piece overlaps the linear square. The horses, the regular <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> type, show more resemblance to the A series of Group II than to the other horses of Group III. This denomination shows a marked deterioration from the standard of the other coins of the group.</p>
               <p>The return to the types and denominations of Group I brings also a renewal of the indication of metrological relationships: the octadrachms and heavy tetrobols have a dotted circular border on the obverse; the tetradrachms and light tetrobols have a linear square within the incuse on the reverse.</p>
               <p>The die sequences (Chapter IV) and the following chart of dies, combinations and specimens show what remains of this group.</p>

               <p>The octadrachms, as always, are very few. The tetradrachms show the use of one P die with three A dies (nos. 113-115), which indicates normal mint activity. Its sole appearance in either large denomination is in this small group; it is possible that the four punch dies known for this denomination are a large proportion of the original number, since thirteen specimens remain from six combinations. The heavy tetrobols, of which only two anvil dies remain, use one of them with three P dies (nos. 118-120); this has been construed to mean more than normal issuing. It may be that the intermission of the denomi-

nation in Group II created a need for increased output for a short time. Thus far there has been a measure of uniformity in the number of surviving dies, particularly P dies (3, 4, 3); the light tetrobols, however, quite spoil the symmetry. Twice as many P dies and at least twice as many A dies (in the case of the heavy tetrobols, four times as many) remain, with only one specimen of each die combination. In addition, there are only the most fragmentary of die links, whereas in the preceding group the light tetrobol links were the most elaborate yet encountered. It is obvious that any estimation of the duration of Group III must take into account this discrepancy, which indicates that the light tetrobols were struck over a period about twice as long as that of all the other denominations.</p>
               <p>The event of greatest importance in the Greek world in the middle of the fifth century was the transfer of the treasury of the League from Delos to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> in 454 and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>' consequent superiority in League affairs. The year 454 is also the earlier of the dates given for the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> (cf. note 1). If a date in the neighborhood of 460 be taken, as suggested, for the beginning of Group III, and if the number of P dies per year be taken as two, as was calculated in Chapter V, twelve P dies would be necessary to cover the period from 460 to 454. In the tetradrachm series, where we have more surviving specimens than in any other denomination, there are four surviving P dies. I suggest that we have remaining about half of the P dies and less than that of the A dies, and that the three largest denominations of Group III were struck between ca. 460 and 454.</p>
               <p>The growing Athenian Empire was sufficiently powerful to influence non-members economically, if not politically. Athenian resentment over Drabescus would not have been permitted to interfere with trade, particularly in such a vital matter as timber, which she acquired chiefly from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia.</placeName> Surely, trade relations with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, who felt himself a Greek, were revived shortly after the Thasian revolt was quelled. One reason for the small size of Group III may be that the financial returns to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> from this trade obviated the need for any great number of coins. The slightly heavier
<pb n="133"/>
striking of tetrobols, at the beginning of the Group, would be for the purpose of local or regional trade. This leaves out of account the light tetrobols, which, from their remains, seem to have been struck over a longer period than the other denominations.</p>
               <p>It will be remembered that the light tetrobols are the equivalent of Attic tetrobols. These, then, would continue to be struck in a time of trade with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, when they would serve for small change. The intermission of the tetradrachms, equal to three Attic drachms, resulted from the influx of Athenian money into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> inpayment for supplies, and, probably unintentionally at first, fitted in with Athenian plans for a curtailment of any but Attic currency. The decree regulating weights, measures and currency used in the empire, formerly thought to have been enacted in the twenties of the fifth century, has, by the discovery of the Cos fragment, been dated 449/8.<ref target="#CH7-n5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> and <persName>E. S. G. Robinson7</persName> has since surveyed the Aegean coinages to determine the effectiveness of the decree. He reports a marked diminution of the city and island coinages at least until the middle of the thirties-and, in some cases, longer. By the last quarter of the fifth century, disregard of the decree was rather general. Whether <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> relaxed the terms (which called for the death penalty for violators) or simply was unable to enforce it, the result was the same.</p>
               <p>Two points are obvious, although apparently little attention has been paid to the first one. (1). <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> would not have promulgated
<pb n="134"/>
such a decree, with such a severe penalty for violators, if she had no previous indication that she would be in a position to enforce it; there probably were coercive efforts on her part, which must have met with some success, before she went so far as to issue the decree. (2). While <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> might coax <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to use only her currency, she was in no position to compel him to do so. Therefore it appears that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> voluntarily suppressed the main part of his coinage in 454 and thereafter struck only the light tetrobols, which could pass as Attic triobols, from that date until his death in 451. Such a <hi rend="italic">volte face</hi> by the man who flaunted his defeat of the Athenians by the waning moon on his octadrachms only ten years earlier should not be too surprising to an age which has seen and is seeing even more abrupt reversals of policy. At any rate, such an interpretation does take into account the discrepancies in Group III, the likelihood that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was working toward making her coinage the only legal tender in the Aegean before she passed the decree to that effect, and the fact that <persName>Perdikkas</persName>, who succeeded <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, struck only these light tetrobols for the first seven or eight years of his reign. It would be interesting to know, but idle to speculate on, what methods of persuasion <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> used on <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
               <p>The interpretation just given of the larger issue of light tetrobols in this last group of coins struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, makes it necessary to assume that he lived beyond 454, although the king's list (see note 1) indicates that date for his death. The change in the coinage could scarcely have taken place before that date, and com<placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>on of the light tetrobols of this group with those assigned to <persName>Perdikkas</persName> (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XI and XII) shows clearly how different the coins of <persName>Perdikkas</persName> are. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> must have struck them, and the majority at least must have appeared after 454. The year 451 is not impossible as a date for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> death from the point of view of his probable age. The first notice of him, (Herod. V, 17-21) as a young adult, occurs in 514. If he were in the neighborhood of 20 at the time, his death in 451 would be at an age only a little over eighty; this is not at all impossible.</p>

                  <p>A stylistic feature of all horsemen, except the one on no. 108, must be pointed out. This is the manner of the arrangement of the drapery. In Group I, the two ends of the chlamys, rather pointed, are visible against the body of the horse. In Group II, some effort is made to represent the folds of the garment as it falls from the shoulder. In Group III, however, with the exception noted above, a pattern has been developed which seems to hark back to the archaic "swallow-tail" pattern of drapery. The folds of both front and back edge of the chlamys are symmetrically arranged in duplicate folds. It is less easy to see on the heavy tetrobols although close examination reveals it. Since the various differences from die to die do not permit the supposition that one artist cut all the dies which show this pattern of folds, the conclusion must be reached that, whoever started it, it became immediately popular and was used by all diecutters. Such careful touches as these make the carelessly prepared dies for the light tetrobols more conspicuous. Perhaps people did not like the idea of falling in with Athenian plans and showed their dislike in this fashion.</p>

               <p>Only three types of fractions can be certainly associated with Group III. Specimens of the three are rare, compared with those in other groups, a fact which may be fortuitous, but which may reflect the already observed small size of Group III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, a, wt. 2.12, from the same pair of dies as a coin in the British Museum, wt. 1.03, is similar in obverse type to the series illustrated by <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, a. The reverses of these coins have a linear square within the incuse, which most of the fractional issues do not have; that in Group II also has an upright caduceus on the reverse which the Group III coins lack. The weights of these two coins from the same dies, 2.12 and 1.05, show clearly the impossibility of defining the denominations of the fractions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, b, is a finer version of the head used in Group II, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, d. The one illustrated, from the Newell Collection, is from the same pair of dies as one in Copenhagen (<hi rend="italic">SNG</hi>, 463); both are nearly the same weight: .56 and .54. This head, in a finely dotted circle, is stylistically superior to the similar coin in Group II and ranks in quality with the head of the rider on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> octadrachm, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, III. The third type (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, c), wt. 1.18, is a development from that Group II (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, e) with the forepart of a horse on the obverse and a helmet in a linear square in the incuse on the reverse. The helmet is of the sort without a nosepiece that occurs only in Group III; therefore its assignment to this group is definite, whatever the doubts about the coin of similar types assigned to Group II (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, e).</p>
               <p>The obverse has three pellets in the field below the horse. These pellets are hard to explain: as marks of value they could indicate a triobol or a trihemiobol. The weights - 1.18 for the coin illustrated, .99 for a similar coin in the British Museum - are a little high for trihemiobols (.81 or .91) but not too high to exceed the bounds of probability. The strange thing is the occurrence of the pellets on coins of this type at one period and nowhere else. Since these small coins would probably have only a local use, their value could easily be regulated by local practice.</p>

               <p>While the literary evidence for the reign of Perdikkas is not so meager as that for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's,</persName> such notices as there are, mainly in Thucydides,<ref target="#CH8-n1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> do not completely clarify his actions. From scattered sources comes knowledge of four brothers, two of whom, <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> and <persName>Alketas,</persName> had some claims to a share in the kingdom.<ref target="#CH8-n2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> There have been suggestions that in turn they held the power at the beginning of the years generally assigned to Perdikkas, but there is no concrete evidence and the coins do not indicate that anyone but Perdikkas was supreme. As the events recorded by Thucydides concern only the years immediately before and during the Peloponnesian War, there is a lacuna of some fifteen years at the beginning of Perdikkas' reign. Probably the earliest datable reference of Thucydides is in I, 57, when in 433 Corinth enlisted the aid of Perdikkas "who was formerly friend and ally of the Athenians." On the basis of the "formerly" in the statement, <hi rend="italic">ATL,</hi> III, p. 313 and note 61 assigns the treaty between Athens and Perdikkas and his relatives (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> I<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 71) to the year 436, on the ground that the foundation of Amphipolis in 437 would make for friendly relations, or at least would make it advisable for Perdikkas to come to terms with the Athenians. But, "formerly" is a vague term and the evidence of Perdikkas' coinage at the time of the foundation of Amphipolis is strongly against the likelihood that he came to terms with the Athenians at that time.</p>
               <p>Between Perdikkas' accession in 451<ref target="#CH8-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> and the year 433 there is only one datable reference, in Strabo (X, 445), who tells of the reception by Perdikkas of refugees from Histiaea in 446/5, "by agreement," the terms of which and its participants are unknown. Two conclusions are to be drawn, (1) that within five years of his
<pb n="149"/>
accession Perdikkas was sole ruler, whatever difficulties he may have had attaining that status, and (2) that he was, if not actively unfriendly to Athens, at least willing to succor her victims. About the same time it is generally concluded<ref target="#CH8-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> the foundation of Brea, "among the Bisaltians"<ref target="#CH8-n5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> by soldiers from the campaign in Euboea, was being made. Nothing is known of the exact location of the town nor of the length of its existence. Its proximity to Argilus, on the very borders of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia,</placeName> is deduced from the fact that Argilus' tribute was reduced in 446/5, probably as the result of loss of territory.<ref target="#CH8-n6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> This event was of great importance to Perdikkas, for the territory of the Bisaltians was actually or prospectively his, and henceforth we might well expect hostility toward Athens on his part. Therefore I should be inclined to date <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> I<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 71 to this time, accepting the new restoration which includes the names of <persName>Perdikkas</persName> and his son <persName corresp="#nomisma_archelaos_abdera">Archelaus,</persName>
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> and his son <persName corresp="#nomisma_amyntas_priene">Amyntas,</persName>
                  <persName>Menelaos,</persName> and <persName>Alketas.</persName> It may be the agreement Strabo mentions in connection with the refugees from Histiaea, and this the price Athens paid for the settlement at Brea.

The inclusion of the names of the Macedonian princes, after that of <persName>Perdikkas</persName> and his son, as well as that of Arrhibaios of Lyncestis, if the new restoration is correct, should point to a time when Athens was content with the supremacy of <persName>Perdikkas</persName> over his brothers and when Macedonian dynastic troubles were at least temporarily settled.</p>
               <p>While the coins of <persName>Perdikkas</persName> do not reveal all the events of his reign, they furnish an illuminating commentary on his relations with Athens before the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. Before the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> we saw the once rich and varied Macedonian coinage dwindle to a mere trickle of rather carelessly struck light tetrobols, equal in weight to Attic triobols. The suggestion was made

in Chapter VII that this phenomenon was the result of cooperation between <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and the Athenians, the cause for which remains obscure. <persName>Perdikkas,</persName> coming to the throne at least two years before the promulgation of the Athenian currency decree<ref target="#CH8-n7">

               <p>Whatever the confusion at the beginning of his reign and whatever measure of independence his brothers may have had, <persName>Perdikkas</persName> must have held the core of the kingdom and control of the metal supply.

for the coins of Perdikkas. He struck no large coins, an almost incredible performance for a reign of nearly forty years. He used the two tetrobol denominations, starting with the light (the Attic triobol) and finally ending with it; the heavy tetrobols were struck at first concurrently with the light, then alone for about ten years, after which time they were abandoned. There are four Series of light tetrobols and three of the heavy tetrobols, with only one date in common. Therefore the light tetrobols have been catalogued first, in their Series, even though they overlap the first heavy tetrobols and follow the last of them. The dates given the seven Series were arrived at through a consideration of dies and their combinations and the historical content of the coins. The evidence furnished by the coins from Olynthus<ref target="#CH8-n12">

               <p>The light tetrobol Series are marked by rather slight differences in type, and seem to have followed directly on one another, with the exception of Series 4. This small issue was struck after an interval during which the mint was closed, and the style was changed completely. The first two Series are connected by an A die; they are separated by a change of type of the P die. Both Series have few die combinations and specimens, while the third and fourth both are more compact. The opposite is the case with the heavy tetrobols: the
<pb n="152"/>
first two Series have a considerable number of die combinations and many more specimens; the last is less well represented.</p>

                  <p>The first Series, nos. 131-147, is characterized by a neat but undistinguished horse on the obverse and a helmet in a single linear square within the incuse on the reverse. The helmet lacks completely the angularity of those on <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> coins, and its crest is attached only on the top of the bowl, with a free hanging plume at the back. This is a rather monotonous succession of coins, with very little difference between the individual dies and with no symbols or initials. They are lacking in the careless irregularity of the last light tetrobols issued by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, but they are pedestrian in the extreme. The surviving links indicate that this Series was struck rather heavily. While none shows the characteristic pattern of three A dies with one P die,<ref target="#CH8-n13">
                        <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                     </ref> nos. 138-140 show the use of one A die with three P dies, none of which shows any appreciable sign of wear. Consequently we may conclude that these coins were struck at double the usual rate, using at least three P dies per year. Since fourteen P dies, with thirteen A dies, survive, a minimum of five years is postulated for Series 1, and the terminal date set at 447/6<ref target="#CH8-n14">
                        <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                     </ref>.</p>
                  <p>The second Series, nos. 148-161, must have followed directly on the first, since A 56 is used with nos. 147 and 148. This is the only link in the Series. The features which characterize these coins are the introduction of the double linear square on the reverse (which continues in the other two Series) and a considerably smaller, almost a dainty helmet. On the reverse the variation from die to die is more pronounced than on Series 1, but on the obverses the horses show no change from the earlier uninspired animals. Both obverse and reverse
<pb n="153"/>
continue without symbol or initial. With no linking P dies as a guide, there is no clue from die sequence for the arrangement of this Series, which therefore is subject to change with the discovery of additional coins. Likewise there is no indication of the period of time over which it was struck. It obviously lasted longer than the first, since there is the same number of P dies (fourteen), one more A die (fourteen), and no links. However, the date of the beginning of Series 3 and of the closely related Series 2 of the heavy tetrobols is quite securely fixed at 437/6, so that the terminal date of Series 2 must be 438/7. This nine-year period, from which there remain fourteen unlinked P dies, must then have been marked by the same heavy striking of which traces remain from Series 1, because at the normal rate of two P dies per year not quite eighteen of them would be necessary. We must assume that a number of P dies must be missing, but not necessarily many A dies.<ref target="#CH8-n15">

                  <p>Series 3 is so involved with the Second Series of heavy tetrobols that discussion of it is better postponed. The final Series of light tetrobols, nos. 170-175, is quite different from all the others and can only have been struck after an appreciable lapse of time. This is apparent from the style of the galloping horses, which in pose and anatomy resemble some of those on the Parthenon frieze and are quite unlike the rather rangy Macedonian steeds. The reverses have an elegant helmet with a luxuriantly curling plume, the double linear square, and as many letters of Perdikkas' name as can be crowded into the remaining crevices and crannies. The design is pleasing, if ornate, but both obverse and reverse lack the vigor and individuality
<pb n="154"/>
which thus far have characterized Macedonian coin types. The die sequence indicates that they were struck heavily and the small number of dies (three P and four A) shows that this Series was very short-lived. It has been assigned to the closing years of Perdikkas' life, 415-413, when he was finally forced to assist Athens in one more attempt on Amphipolis.<ref target="#CH8-n16">
                        <hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>While Perdikkas struck these coins of the weight of Attic triobols at the beginning and at the end of his reign, there was a period of some twenty years when they were intermitted, ca. 435/4-416/5. Shortly before the intermission he began to issue heavy tetrobols (2.45) which had last been struck by his father before 454 (cf. Chapter VII). The two denominations were thus struck concurrently for a time, possibly as long as ten years, while the heavy tetrobols alone were issued between 435/4 and ca. 425/4. Apparently there was a complete cessation of Macedonian mint activity during the years 425-416. It is safe to conclude that the coins reflect Perdikkas' relations with Athens: at the beginning of his reign and at its end he fitted his currency to the Attic. From the time of the founding of Amphipolis he concentrated on an issue which was impossible to exchange with the Attic. It is most unlikely that <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> I<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 71 is to be dated during that period.</p>

on the obverse and the forepart of a lion on the reverse. The obverse type was from the tribal alliance, the reverse a regal Macedonian type. The appearance of these coins signals the end of the period of any rapprochement between Perdikkas and Athens, and with the second Series of them the aim of Perdikkas was clarified, for his use of symbols harking back to the period of the tribal alliance must be taken as a deliberate attempt on the part of the Macedonian to foment opposition to Athenian imperialistic policy. It is worthy of notice that as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> had been the first to aid Athenian financial policy by subordinating its currency to the Attic, so it was the first to break away, although of course there could have been no compulsion in its subordination.</p>

The case is different with these plated coins of Perdikkas. Polyaenus, IV, 102, who is of course late and therefore not above a certain amount of suspicion, says that Perdikkas, when making war, used bronze coins because he lacked silver. There are no bronze coins attributable to him. If this Perdikkas is the one to whom Polyaenus refers (and he seems to be), these plated coins may well be the cause for his comment. There is no way of knowing the reason for his lack of silver; perhaps his enemies got possession of his source of supply in the interior.</p>

mint procedure, and three instances of one A die with three P dies, indicating increased mint activity. At least five years of striking are indicated by the surviving dies; since there are five unlinked die combinations eight years have been allowed for it, 445/4-438/7. The terminal date cannot be lowered because the content of Series 2 indicates that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> must have begun in 437/6.

                  <p>Series 2, nos. 195-233, is an intricate group of linking dies as interesting as intricate. It consists of seventeen P dies and twenty- five A dies in thirty-nine combinations; there are seventy-one specimens. The intricacy of the links is such that special charts have been added at the end of Chapter IV in an attempt to show the details. The obverse type changes from a walking horse with its rider to a gaily prancing one. The horse is still Macedonian, not the''foreign" horse of the Group II light tetrobols with H, but the change serves to point up the attempt at tribal solidarity, further emphasized by the addition of symbols to obverse and reverse. These latter are the caduceus, a survival from the Apollo-Hermes tribal type, which had been used as a symbol by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander;</persName> the flowering or flowerless plant, also a sixth century tribal symbol, and the dog, which had appeared on coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander.</persName> Other dies bear Perdikkas' initial or the first
<pb n="157"/>
letters of his name. These symbols must be taken as propaganda and Perdikkas' purpose nearly the same as that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in the seventies and sixties of the fifth century, but with a slight difference. Where <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was assuredly master in his kingdom and could afford to suppress strictly regal types such as the lion, Perdikkas had rival claimants to his throne, claimants who were even then working for the support of Athens against him. Therefore he could not afford to leave the royal lion off of his coins. And, where <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had first revived the tribal alliance to assist the Greeks in their pursuit of lagging Persians and only turned against the Athenians when they attempted a settlement at Ennea Hodoi, Perdikkas was working to enlist tribal support solely against Athenian imperialism. In both cases Athenian encroachments on Macedonian territory roused the ruling monarch to unite his neighbors against them.</p>
                  <p>The unprecedented scale of mint activity at this time is shown by the fact that there are seven P dies which serve as links between the walking and prancing horse types. Since none of the eight A dies with the walking horse used with these linking P dies shows any sign of wear, we may draw two conclusions: (i) The walking horse type must itself have been struck heavily to have eight dies in simultaneous use and (2) the type must have been abandoned instantaneously without waiting until the A dies wore out. It is not safe to conclude that mint activity increased still further with the use of the prancing horse A dies because ten of them survive with the linking punches; there may easily be two missing walking horse A dies. We can be content with the concrete evidence of seven P dies in use at once, a condition for which I can find no parallel in other mints.</p>
                  <p>This sudden phenomenal activity is to be associated with the Athenian foundation of Amphipolis. Nothing else would so arouse Perdikkas, for the location of the town was of as much importance to him as that of Ennea Hodoi had been to his father. Athenian interest in rivals for his throne, by which means Athens undoubtedly sought to distract Perdikkas, would certainly aggravate his antipathy. Since the mere striking of a lot of coins would not be more than a

gadfly to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens,</placeName> it is obvious that this is only one phase of his activity. He countered Athens' move by urging and assisting the Chalcidians to federate and establish a stronghold near him. In addition to releasing land to them (Thuc. I, 58) he furnished them monetary assistance with the coins of Series 2.</p>
                  <p>The third Series of light tetrobols is marked by the same change of obverse type, although there are no signs of such feverish haste in issuing these coins. In fact, the Series ended very shortly after the change was made. The beginning of it must be dated to 437/6, with that of the corresponding heavy tetrobols. The paucity of dies (five P dies, eight A dies, eight combinations and twelve surviving specimens) shows that it probably ceased by 435/4, the same year that Argilus, Olynthus and Tragilus all were absent from the full panel. The end of this Series marks the end of <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> financial cooperation with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> for a period of twenty years.</p>
                  <p>The short series of Olynthian coins, on the same standard as the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> and showing the same shift of obverse type from a standing horse to a prancing one, which has generally been dated to the thirties of the fifth century<ref target="#CH8-n19">

weight standard, all show the influence of the Macedonian mint. Since only one of the eight A dies has the prancing horse, it is safe to suggest that this issue was begun shortly after the first Series of heavy tetrobols started, possibly ca. 443, and ceased during the first year of Series 2, 437/6. The very heavy issue of the second Series of Perdikkas' heavy tetrobols would thus care for the monetary needs not only of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians,</orgName> but also of the Chalcidians, when the latter were beginning their federation at Olynthus.</p>
                  <p>The evidence of the coins from Olynthus is of considerable interest and importance,<ref target="#CH8-n22">
                        <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                     </ref> although the hoards found there are of no particular significance for the coins of Perdikkas, since only one (Hoard V, buried ca. 421) might be of value in dating them and it contained only three, Series 1, no. 182, and Series 2, nos. 219 and 226. However, the numbers and types of <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins found at Olynthus have bearing on the arrangement and dating of the Series.</p>

                  <p>The total of six light tetrobols as contrasted with thirty-nine heavy tetrobols from Olynthus is partly due to the fact that during the lifetime of the first three light tetrobol Series Olynthus was not yet the large town it became after the formation of the League and partly to the fact that the standard of the heavy tetrobols was that adopted by Olynthus. Nevertheless Series 3, of which no specimens come from Olynthus, is the only one chronologically suitable for representation there. An expansion of the heavy tetrobol chart shows clearly how much new material came from Olynthus.</p>

                  <p>While the same number of coins from Series 1 and Series 3, as well as the same number of die combinations, was found at Olynthus, the proportions run considerably higher for the latest Series. It will also be noticed that the number of new dies from Olynthus is highest in Series 3. These figures are consistent with the fact that Olynthus was striking her own coins during part of the time Series I was struck; the abrupt cessation of these coins shortly after the beginning of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> Series 2 heavy tetrobols made the need for Perdikkas' coins the greater. During the period between the founding of Amphi- polis in 437 and the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, the Chalcidians who were gathering at Olynthus relied on the output of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> mint; the discontinuance of the purely Olynthian types is consistent with the plan for a League or Federation, to which the personality of "Olynthus" was to be subject. The evidence from Series 3 indicates that although Perdikkas was induced to join Phormio's expedition against Olynthus in 431 (Thuc. II, 29) trade continued between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> and Olynthus.</p>
                  <p>For comparative purposes the first three groups of Chalcidic League tetrobols are given; the date are those assigned by <persName>Robinson</persName> and <persName>Clement</persName> on the basis of the number of dies in each group.</p>

                  <p>The total known specimens of Groups A and B, thirty-six, are fewer than the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> tetrobols found at Olynthus, and the number from the site itself, fourteen, is in sharp contrast to the twenty-three tetrobols of Series 2 found there. Although it was not unnatural for <persName>Robinson</persName> and <persName>Clement</persName> to start with the year 432/1 as the <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> for the Chalcidic League issues, and to base subsequent dates upon the number of dies and combinations, the evidence of <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> mint technique, which the Chalcidians borrowed, and of the coins of Perdikkas indicate that the starting year for the League coins should be at least one year later, probably coinciding with Perdikkas' cooperation with Phormio in 431. Group A shows the normal activity of one P die with three A dies and can be assumed to have lasted about two years; the dies become very worn before being replaced by those of Group B, a fact which may be attributed to lack of communication with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> and a subsequent scarcity of workmen capable of making new dies. In Group B, where there are ten die combinations, there is an instance of one A die being used with three P dies, from which we may conclude that the issue was heavily struck, over a shorter period of time than the three years assigned. In Group C, there is another sign of great production in the use of one P die with four A dies. Therefore I should suggest the following dates for the first three Groups of Chalcidic League coins: Gr. A, 431/0-430/29; Gr. B, 429/8-427/6; Gr. C, 426/5-421. This would take into account the evidence of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins found at Olynthus, where Series 2 (437/6-432/1) is largely represented and Series 3 (431/0-425/4) is less well represented than Groups B and C of the League coins.</p>

there. The terminal date has been given as 425/4 merely as a suggestion. There are two possibilities: (1) There may have been a number of years in the middle twenties of the fifth century when Perdikkas was too involved with <persName>Philip, Derdas, Seuthes</persName> and <persName>Sitalkes,</persName> and the <orgName type="ethnic">Athenians,</orgName> to strike coins; indeed the mines themselves may have been shut down during hostilities. The heavy striking of Group C of the Chalcidic League coins may point to a return of the favor done the Chalcidians by Perdikkas and he may have relied on their mint output. (2) There may have been a rather long period when Series 3 was being struck at even less than the normal rate of the mint, and the Series may have lasted until 420, when the League started issuing tetradrachms. While we know that Perdikkas refused the amount he had promised to Brasidas after the expedition against the Lyn- cestians (Thuc. IV, 79-128), that action seems to have been based on indignation rather than on financial embarrassment. Actually, the most that can be said is that the third Series must have ended well before the beginning of the fourth Series of light tetrobols, struck near the end of Perdikkas' reign in a style entirely different from all his other coins.</p>

               <head>3. FRACTIONAL ISSUES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, d-g.</head>
               <p>There are four varieties of fractional issues, all apparently obols, which are identifiable with Group IV. The first, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, d, is the only one with a simple four-part linear square in an incuse on the reverse. Its obverse is a bridled horse tethered to a ring, a type closely similar to the obverse of the Olynthian tetrobols struck at this time. The second variety <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> (XI, e) has a similar obverse, but the reverse has the forepart of a lion with ГEP surrounding it. This type should belong with the heavy Series, and probably the first variety as well, but the weights are inconclusive. I do not know the weight of the coin of the first variety (from Brussels); the two specimens of the second variety (<placeName>London,</placeName>
                  <hi rend="italic">BMC Mac.,</hi> p. 162, 2, illustrated here, and

                  </ref> wts. .64 and .55 respectively, might be obols on either standard, since the norms are .61 and .54. These two varieties are to be dated between 443/2 and 432/1, from their style and types; probably they are on the heavy standard.</p>
               <p>The two other varieties show completely new types and foreshadow the fourth century issues, but since both have ГEP on the reverse there can be no doubt about their assignment. The first (<placeName>London,</placeName> wt. .76, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, f) has a beautiful, strong head of Herakles in his lion-skin on the obverse and on the reverse his bow and club diagonally arranged within the incuse, the spaces filled with the letters ГEP. The choice of the Heraklean type can easily be justified by the Argive ancestry of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> kings, here for the first time clearly marked on the coins. It has already been suggested that the lion forepart contains a remote reference to Herakles, but that type has an uncompromising anonymity.<ref target="#CH8-n25">
                     <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                  </ref> The weight may be that of a trihemiobol on the light standard (norm .81); since this and the following variety must have been struck near the end of Perdikkas' life, when he was striking only light tetrobols, it is to be assumed that the light standard prevailed. The second variety is known to me from only one example (Hirsch, 1909, 471, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, g). The obverse, with the forepart of a galloping horse, recalls the earlier and larger fractions of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> V, d and e; IX, c; XI, c); its reverse has the forepart of a boar, with one leg bent, and faint traces of a club above, with the letters ГEP. This reverse is anticipatory of the reverses of bronze pieces assigned to Amyntas III (cf. <hi rend="italic">BMC Mac.</hi>p. 172, 9 and G. <hi rend="italic">AMNG,</hi> III, 2, Pl. 30, 4 and 5). While it is not safe to draw any conclusions from the weight of one small coin, it is worth remarking that this is the lightest fraction known to me, wt. .40. It may therefore be a coin of Perdikkas III although by the second quarter of the fourth century fractional pieces were regularly issued
<pb n="165"/>
in bronze, rather than silver. It would seem that the only possible significance of the boar is Heraklean, but some unrecorded alliance or amity may have made the Calydonian boar significant as a minor coin type. On the whole it is more probable that this coin should be assigned to Perdikkas II, not least because the style of the half-horse on the obverse is very like that of the horses on the fourth Series of light tetrobols (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, nos. 170-175).</p>

                  <p>The Copenhagen coin appears to lack the ring to which the horse is tethered. As the coin is worn it is impossible to tell from cast or photograph whether it was there originally.</p>

               <head>4. CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>While the coins of Perdikkas do not answer all questions about the events of his reign, they do illuminate fifth century history to a considerable extent. At the beginning of his reign he continued his father's policy of cooperation with Athens by striking only light tetrobols. He was busy keeping his kingdom intact against the efforts of his brothers and his uncles and his cousins. The coins indicate his success, since they are homogeneous, if dull. At a date no longer precisely determinable, but between 446/5 and 443/2, he revived the issue of heavy tetrobols which had not been struck since ca. 454, and struck them at more than the normal rate for the Macedonian mint for over six years. Shortly after the beginning of this issue Perdikkas made friendly overtures to Olynthus and the Chalcidians, going so far as to provide the means for Olynthus to strike her own coins for the first time since the final expulsion of the Persians in 479,<ref target="#CH8-n26">
                     <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                  </ref> or possibly even striking the coins in the Macedonian mint. This almost certainly was a counter-move to the <placeName>Athenian</placeName> plan for Amphipolis. There is every likelihood that Perdikkas' hostile relatives were also involved; certainly the subsequent alignment of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> and Derdas (Thuc. I, 57, 59-61) with Athens, and the agreement with Sitalkes (Thuc. II, 95ff.) indicate Athenian diplomatic manoeuvring in the north. The map reveals the value of Olynthus to Perdikkas; it could serve as a bulwark against Athens more readily accessible to him than
<pb n="166"/>
Potidaea, or than Acanthus, which was nearer the proposed site of Amphipolis. Since the coin types used by the Chalcidians in 479 were from those of the tribal alliance, even though the weight standard was not, it may be concluded that there were traditional ties between the Chalcidians and Macedonians, which did not exist in the case of Potidaea, a Corinthian colony, or Acanthus, both of which used types unrelated to those of the tribal alliance. The second Series of heavy tetrobols, beginning in the year after the foundation of Amphipolis, was very heavy to supply the needs both of the <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonians</orgName> and of the Chalcidians, who, by 436, must have been starting to assemble at Olynthus. It has already been pointed out that the treaty between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and the Macedonians, <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> I<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 71, cannot be dated to this year.</p>
               <p>The start of hostilities in the north brought about a breach between Perdikkas and the Chalcidians for a time at least, and Perdikkas' coins decreased in numbers. The events of the war years thus leave only a negative trace: perhaps some of his hostile relatives gained a foothold in the interior and shut off his supply of metal. This might account for the cessation of his heavy tetrobols, the absence of any coins for some years, and the use of some plated coins in his final Series of light tetrobols. This suggestion would have more weight if there were any coins assignable to his rivals during this, or any other, period. Since there are none, one can only say that <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> coins ceased entirely to be minted for some ten years and that there was a brief final issue by Perdikkas at the end of his life, again on the standard that was the equivalent of the Attic.</p>
               <p>Although Perdikkas had not gained all that he hoped for from the formation of the Chalcidic League, he at least assured the perpetuation of one of the old tribal types, Apollo, and of the tribal weight standard, since they were adopted and continued by the League. The tetradrachms are half the octadrachms of 29.46, with a norm of 14.73, not on the Phoenician standard as they are usually described. The Chalcidians preserved the standard until it again came into <orgName type="ethnic">Macedonian</orgName> use under <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II.</persName>
