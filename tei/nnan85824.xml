counterfeit money in a bag, "which he Delivered to <persName>Jacobs</persName> heaving something over board in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>." <persName>Rush</persName> was imprisoned on the island during <persName>Jacobs</persName>' abode there, and, since the crime had not been committed in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, <persName>Jacobs</persName> brought back <persName>Rush</persName> as a prisoner to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, where <persName>Rush</persName> admitted that he owned the money but claimed he had it from a certain <persName>Edward Coffee</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>. Since the crime had probably been committed in that province and since <persName>Rush</persName> said he had a family there, the Council of the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> wrote to the Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> that they were sending him <persName>Rush</persName> as a prisoner with a copy of Cornelius <persName>Jacobs</persName>' deposition in order that justice might take place and the truth be better discovered.<ref target="#CH1-n15">

               <hi rend="bold">A</hi>t the beginning of the eighteenth century the courts in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> looked upon counterfeiters as cheats and prosecuted those charged with the crime for misdemeanors. As a result cases which in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> would have been tried at Assizes were cognizable in Sessions.<ref target="#CH2-n1">

               </ref> The clipping and passing of Spanish coins was fairly common, and on February 5, 1701, the grand jurors found a bill against a certain <persName>Susannah Elliott</persName> for uttering and putting away clipped and hammered money. She pleaded not guilty in the Court of Quarter Sessions and brought the King's writ of certiorari for removing the indictment and record to the next Supreme Court of Judicature, which was allowed and ordered to be returned.<ref target="#CH2-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> The Supreme Court on October 7, 1701, ordered the record of the <persName>Widow Elliott</persName> to be brought up from Quarter Sessions in the afternoon<ref target="#CH2-n3">

            <p>On May 7, 1701, <persName>Richard Thomas</persName>, a mariner, who had been indicted by the grand jury on the previous day for uttering counterfeit dollars, was tried in Quarter Sessions and found not guilty.<ref target="#CH2-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> The next winter, on February 4, 1702, <persName>William Fowler</persName>, charged with passing sundry clipped "Ryalls" in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, appeared in Quarter Sessions and managed to make an explanation which satisfied the court. His story was that the clipped coins in question were intermixed with a large sum of money, that he did not know the persons who had clipped them, that he did not know there were such pieces among the coins he
<pb n="8"/>
paid out until he had paid the same, and finally that he believed he had received the said money from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode Island</placeName>. Thereupon several persons of note came forward and vouched for his honesty and good fame and reputation. The court then ordered that the clipped coins, 131 in number, be melted down and given to the defendant, who was discharged, paying his fees.<ref target="#CH2-n5">

            </p>
            <p>The clipping and counterfeiting which was going on prompted the common council of the City of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> on October 26, 1702, to resolve to petition the General Assembly of the province that a "Law be made Prohibiting the Coyning &amp; Clipping of the Currt. Money &amp; for uttering base Money in the Room of good."<ref target="#CH2-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> Even before the assembly took action on the petition, two more persons were indicted, the first of whom was <persName>Garrett Onclebagg</persName>, a silversmith and assistant alderman.<ref target="#CH2-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref>
               <persName>Onclebagg</persName> appeared in Quarter Sessions on November 3, 1702, and with his surety, <persName>Ahasuerus Hendrickse</persName>, gave bail in the amount of £100 not to depart the court without permission. The next day the grand jury indicted him for coining and uttering "false Money of base &amp; mixt Mettalls." The defendant prayed that he have time till the next court to traverse the indictment and that he have a copy thereof. His requests were granted, and he provided bail in the amount of £200, and his sureties, <persName>Ahasuerus Hendrickse</persName> and <persName>Lawrence Vanhooke</persName>, each in the amount of £100. When the next court met on February 3, 1703, <persName>Onclebagg</persName> at first pleaded not guilty and requested that his trial be postponed until the following morning, to which the court gave its consent. Later in the day, however, he reconsidered, withdrew his plea with the court's permission, and, though protesting he was not guilty of the "fraud" mentioned in the indictment, nevertheless submitted himself to a fine and prayed the mercy of the court. He was thereupon fined twenty pounds and fees, ordered to stand committed until the same were paid and also to give sureties in the
<pb n="9"/>
sum of £100 for his good behavior for one year.<ref target="#CH2-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> Henceforth he apparently did no more counterfeiting, although he was in the courts not infrequently, for example in 1710 for bastardy and in 1712 for champerty,<ref target="#CH2-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref> and for a time he located in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> to escape accusations but later returned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n10">

            </p>
            <p>On the day after the indictment of <persName>Onclebagg</persName> for coining and uttering the grand jurors presented a certain <persName>Sophia Thomas</persName> "for having in her Custody sundry Clippings of Currt. Silver Money &amp; beaten plate." At the next court, on February 3, 1703, the defendant demurred to the insufficiency of the indictment. When the attorney general joined in the demurrer and the court had heard the argument, it was ordered that the indictment be quashed as insufficient and that the defendant be discharged from her recognizance, paying fees.<ref target="#CH2-n11">
                  <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Possibly the cases of <persName>Onclebagg</persName> and <persName>Sophia Thomas</persName> helped the sponsors of a bill to prohibit coining and clipping which had been proposed by the City Council in October. In any event, a law was passed by the assembly entitled "An Act against Forging, Counterfeiting and Clipping of Foreign Coyn, which is Current Money in the Collony of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>." The text of this act, which was signed by the governor on November 27, 1702, is as follows:
<q>For as much as by the Laws of this Collony no Condigne Punishment is at this time provided for such evil disposed Persons as shall Counterfeit, Forge, Clip, File or otherwise lessen and debase such kind of Gold or Silver of other Realms, as current Money within this Collony of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>, where by divers evil disposed Persons as well without this Collony as within, are encouraged and imboldened Dayly to Counterfeit, Forge, Clip, File and otherwise lessen and debase such kind of Gold and Silver, and utter the same in this Collony, to the great detriment of her Majestys Subjects. Be it therefore Enacted by the Governour and Council and Representatives conven'd in General Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That
<pb n="10"/>
if any Person or Persons hereafter shall falsely Forge, Counterfeit, Clip, File or otherwise lessen or debase such kind of Gold or Silver as is the current Money of this Collony, and is permitted to be current within the same the Offenders therein, their promoters, aiders and abettors, being convicted thereof, according to the Laws of her Majesties Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, of such Offences, shall be Imprisoned for the space of one whole Year and a Day, and forfeit all their Goods and Chattels, any Law, Usage or Custom to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.

            <p>It was not long before a grand jury indicted, on February 3, 1703, one <persName>Anna Vanderspiegel</persName> for having uttered on January 24 newly clipped and filed Spanish money which was current in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. On May 4 the defendant demurred to the insufficiency of the indictment, the attorney general joined in the demurrer and the Court of Quarter Sessions ordered the prisoner discharged.<ref target="#CH2-n13">

            <p>The authorities were with reason concerned about the clipping of coin and the importation of clipped pieces, and on April 17, 1705, the governor and council ordered that a proclamation issue forbidding the importation of clipped bitts and double bitts.<ref target="#CH2-n14">
                  <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
               </ref> On the first of May two persons were indicted for clipping Spanish coin and uttering the clippings. One of them was <persName>Mary Barnes</persName>, a victualler, who was charged with having "fraudulently deceitfully and Craftilly" clipped Spanish Ryalls and pieces of Eight and on April 18 in the <placeName>East Ward</placeName> of the city paid out the clippings. She pleaded not guilty, was prosecuted in Quarter Sessions on August 8 by <persName>Attorney General Bickley</persName>, and was acquitted by the jury. The other individual, likewise accused of clipping "Royalls and double Royalls" and passing the clippings on April 7 in the <placeName>East Ward</placeName>, was a baker named <persName>John Kingston</persName>, who pleaded not guilty and, like <persName>Mary Barnes</persName>, was acquitted by the jury.<ref target="#CH2-n15">

            <p>Before these cases had come to trial, the governor, <persName corresp="#viaf_104145857971223022169">Viscount Cornbury</persName>, in a speech to the assembly on June 14, 1705, said: "I am of opinion it will be necessary to pass An Act to prevent ye clipping &amp; Defacing ye Forreign Coin wch has Currency in this Province."<ref target="#CH2-n16">
                  <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
               </ref> No act was passed, however, and at a meeting of the governor and council on December 13, 1705, a newly appointed member of that body, <persName corresp="#viaf_55943557">John Barberie</persName>, acquainted the board that notwithstanding the endeavors that had been made to prevent the importation of clipped bitts and double bitts great sums of them were daily being brought into <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> from neighboring colonies. He therefore prayed that some measures be taken to prevent this in the future, and the consideration of the matter was deferred until the next meeting of the council.<ref target="#CH2-n17">

            <p>In the spring of 1705 the authorities in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> had their first contact with a counterfeiter of paper money, an extremely slippery individual named <persName>Thomas Odell</persName>. In July of the preceding year <persName corresp="#viaf_76748915">Governor Dudley</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> was so alarmed by the counterfeiting of the twenty shilling bill of his province that he had issued a reward of £50 for the apprehension of anyone concerned in the matter. Within a week two blacksmiths, <persName>Peregrine White</persName> and <persName>Benons White</persName>, a carpenter, <persName>John Brewer</persName>, and a winecooper, <persName>Daniel Amos</persName>, were in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> jail, and their plate and press had been seized.<ref target="#CH2-n18">

            <p>The law which had been passed in 1702 forbidding the clipping of foreign coin had expired after one year but as the colony was still plagued by clipped money the assembly in September, 1708, passed an act to revive the law of 1702, and the measure was signed by <persName>Governor Cornbury</persName> on October 6.

The act of October 30, 1710, provided that whatever was contained in the earlier law so far as it related to clipping only was repealed. It was further enacted that all clippings of foreign coin current in the colony that should make up the weight of money received or passed, should have the appearance of the stamp of the foreign coin on some part of the clipping. It was likewise specified that no dollars or half dollars or any other coin than Spanish coin of "Civil, Pillar &amp; Mexico Plate" was permitted by this act to be clipped.<ref target="#CH2-n31">

<q>had found some Books and Papers, belonging to <persName>Thomas Lynstead</persName> who hanged himself on Saturday last, which Papers and Books discovered That the said <persName>Lynstead</persName> [had been] concerned in Counterfeiting Public Bills of Credit of this Province.

            <p>At the time that <persName>Lynstead</persName>'s affairs were under investigation a number of counterfeit bills were brought into the Court of Quarter Sessions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> and there burned on May 8, 1723: <persName>Robert Walker</persName>, the mayor, produced a bill of three pounds, no. 3010, one of twenty shillings without any number, one of five pounds, no. 1475, another of five pounds, no. 77, and one of thirty shillings, no. 1114; <persName>Mr. Justice Kip</persName> produced one other bill of ten shillings, "all which were taken upon Persons that were passing the same but that no discovery could be made of the Person or Persons who Counterfeited the same being traced back to a great many Persons who had taken the same Bills as good &amp; passed the same from One to another without discovering the fraud."<ref target="#CH3-n20">

            <p>In the same year the passing of counterfeit coin was brought to the attention of the Court of General Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5141784">Ulster County</placeName> meeting in <placeName>Kingston</placeName> on December 18, when <persName>John Crook</persName> and <persName>Jurian Tappan</persName> complained of one <persName>Benjamin Wentwood</persName> and <persName>Isaak More</persName> for tendering false <persName>Lyon</persName> dollars<ref target="#CH3-n21">

            <p>In July of this year, however, two anonymous letters were placed under the door of <persName>William Bradford</persName>, printer of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>'s first newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi>. The first epistle, which was shoved beneath his door on the night of July 15 and discovered the following morning, read thus: "Whereas several of these parts of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> have sustained various Damages by Counterfeit Paper Money, especially <hi rend="italic">

intended, is (as their friend) desirous they may be careful of what large Bills they receive, <hi rend="italic">to wit</hi>, 40 s. or 3 l. or from whom they receive them. This will immediately be put in Execution, if not stopt by timely Notice, and the Evil consequence being such, as the Innocent may suffer as soon or perhaps sooner than the Guilty. It is believed by the Author the Design is chiefly against <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>."</p>
            <p>In printing this item <persName>Bradford</persName> added: "If the Author of the above Letter does know any thing of Counterfeit Bills of Credit as by his Letter he intimates, its expected that he will discover the same. And if he will apply to some Magistrate in this Province, and make a full Discovery of such Counterfeit Bills being made or that are making, he will be suitably Rewarded by the Government for such his Discovery."<ref target="#CH4-n10">

            </p>
            <p>The Saturday morning after <persName>Bradford</persName> published the above he found a second message which he printed in his newspaper on Monday. Its text was as follows:
<q>Your Recommending that Letter which was found under your Door Wednesday Morning, July the 16th, to the Press, has been of very valuable Service both to this Government, and other Governments; tho' the Author cou'd give no visible Proof that he had seen any thing, further than the Proposal of such and such Person to him. concerning the matter; and the Circumstantial Evidences that followed their Proposals. You say, it was expected the Author would give his information against them; which cou'd tend neither to the advantage or disadvantage of the about-to-be Offended, Accused, or Informer, more than render the Informer obnoxious, having no more (probable) to say than has been already here mentioned, which in the Author's Opinion, are not sufficient Evidences. However its desired you may in your next Paper also warn the Inhabitants of receiving 3 l. 40 s. or 30 s. Bills of Credit. I am much convinced the Design is already stop'd; however, I cannot see wherein a second Caution may be amiss The Author is desirous you may produce the Letter you first received, to none, save to such as can produce the True Tokens of it: which may happen to tend greatly to the Advantage of</q>
               <pb n="32"/>

               <q>The Author – – –</q>
               <q>N.B. The former Letter has at the Bottom of it certain Marks, which (I suppose) are those that this Author calls the True Tokens of it. And according to his Request the two Letters shall be kept and ready to produce (in order to serve or save him – – –) when he produces the True Tokens (as he calls 'em).<ref target="#CH4-n11">

            </p>
            <p>Nothing further is known of the author of the letters or the counterfeiting to which he referred. Perhaps the warnings in the newspaper frightened the criminals and caused them to desist from their plans.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, on August 3, the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi> contained this brief item: "A School-master on <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q18432">Staten-Island</placeName> is apprehended and put in Prison there, for Counterfeiting the 30 s. and 3 l.

               </hi>. He did the whole with his Pencil, and so exact that the Difference was not easily discovered. He had passed about 10 or 12 l. before it was discovered." Unfortunately there seems to be no evidence as to the name of the teacher or his fate.</p>
            <p>On October 17, 1730, an act was passed for striking bills of credit in the amount of £3,000 which were to be deposited in the treasury to be exchanged for shattered, torn and defaced bills. The act contained the same provisions about counterfeiting as were included in the earlier act of November 11, 1726.<ref target="#CH4-n12">

            <p>The next counterfeiter to be apprehended, however, had not been making bills but coin. He was a certain <persName>John Conner</persName>, who on November 30, 1730, was indicted for felony and on five other counts, the last of which was "for a Cheat in having Several ps of false coin with tools &amp; Instruments about for the coining of such false coin." To all of these the prisoner pleaded not guilty. The next day he was tried in the Supreme Court, and the following persons were evidences for the King: <persName>John Vanhorne</persName>, <persName>James Vanhorne</persName>, <persName>Abraham Vanhorne</persName>, <persName>Thomas Wenman</persName>, <persName>Jacob Bratt</persName>, <persName>Evert Bratt</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Serjeant</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Zenger</persName>.

               <persName>horne</persName> to the value of upwards of forty shillings and of the indictment of <persName>Mr. Zenger</persName> to the value of six shillings.

            <p>Early in 1732 false dollars were circulating in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, for an item bearing the dateline "<placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>, January 18" appeared in the <hi rend="italic">American Weekly Mercury</hi> of January 25, 1732, and also in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New-England</placeName> Weekly Journal</hi> of February 7, 1732. It read: "There has been a Suspicion of some Counterfeit Dollars being made here in this City; upon which, last Week, a special Warrant was issued, and one of the Persons suspected, is absconded; but no Proof appearing against the other, he is discharged; however this may caution People to take care what Dollars they receive."</p>
            <p>Neither the pillory, carting, whipping nor the gallows put an end to counterfeiting. About the end of May, 1734, the <hi rend="italic">

               </ref> "one <persName>Thomas Copley</persName>, was apprehended here, on Suspicion of Coining and uttering false Dollars, when he found himself discover'd he flung 18 in a Purse over the Fence into a Neighbouring Yard, some that he kept loose in his Pocket he dropt into the Privy, the Purse was immediately found but it is supposed that those which he dropt into the Privy are not all found."</p>
            <p>On August 3 <persName>Copley</persName> was arraigned in the Supreme Court and pleaded not guilty to an indictment for uttering a counterfeit dollar. His trial took place on August 5, and the witnesses for the King were <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Eastham</persName>, <persName>John Eastham</persName> and <persName>Jane McDermot</persName>, so it is probable that <persName>Copley</persName> passed the dollar to the <persName>Easthams</persName>. He was found guilty and the next day the court sentenced him to be set in the public pillory of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> on August 7 from eleven in the morning until noon and on August 9 at the same hour to be given thirty lashes at the public whipping post and then be discharged, paying his fees.<ref target="#CH4-n15">

It is recorded that, on the same day that <persName>Copley</persName> was pilloried, <persName>Justice Cruger</persName> brought into Quarter Sessions eighteen false dollars which had been found on <persName>Copley</persName>, and these counterfeits were then broken to pieces in open court.<ref target="#CH4-n16">

            <p>A law of November 28, 1734, authorizing the striking of £10,000 of new bills, fixed the penalty of death without benefit of clergy for any who should alter, counterfeit, or knowingly pass altered or counterfeited bills of this emission.<ref target="#CH4-n17">

               </ref> The next case to cause a stir in the colony, however, was one concerned with the counterfeiting of the ten shillings bills of an earlier emission, that of October 20, 1730. The governor and council on February 3, 1735, took cognizance of the situation by deciding to issue a proclamation. "It appearing to this board," read their minutes, "that severall of the ten Shillings bills made of that Denomination or vallue with a design to pass them as for the true &amp; reall bills of Creditt of this Collony and that Severall of Such bills have of late been utter'd in payment which if not timely prevented may tend to the great Hurt and damage of many of his Matiës liege subjects within this Collony It is therefore Ordered by his Excellency by and with the advice and consent of his Matiës Councill that a Proclamation issue with a promise of a reward of fifty pounds to any person or persons who Shall discover the author or authors of the aforesaid false or counterfeit bills to be paid to Such person or persons upon the Conviction of such author or authors with a promise likewise of pardon to anyone of the accomplices that are privy to interested or concerned therein who Shall make Such discovery."<ref target="#CH4-n18">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The proclamation, voted by the council and dated February 5, was duly issued by <persName corresp="#viaf_66317250">Governor William Cosby</persName> and published in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi> of February 11. It read:
<q>It having been Represented to me, that several of the <hi rend="italic">Ten Shilling Bills of Credit</hi> of this Colony have been lately counterfeited, or false Bills made of that Denomination, – – – with a Design to pass them as for the true

and real Bill of Credit of this Colony; and that several of such <hi rend="italic">False Bills</hi> have of late been uttered in Payment, which, if not timely prevented, may tend to the great hurt and damage of many of his Majesty's Liege Subjects within this Colony. I have therefore thought fit with the Advice of his Majesty's Council to issue this Proclamation, hereby promising a Reward of <hi rend="italic">Fifty Pounds</hi> to any Person or Persons who shall Discover the Author or Authors of the aforesaid False or Counterfeit Bills to be paid to the Person or Persons discovering the same, upon the Conviction of such Author or Authors. And I do likewise hereby Promise a Pardon to any of the Accomplices that were privy, aiding or assisting to, interested, employed or concerned therein, who shall make such Discovery as aforesaid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The same number of the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> which carried the proclamation also gave the following account of one <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName>, the probable author of the counterfeits:
<q>On Monday they [sic!] 4th Instant some false Ten Shilling Bills of Credit, Dated <graphic url="NNM127_044a.jpg"/> October xx <graphic url="NNM127_044b.jpg"/> 1730 were disovred [sic!] in this City and the Person that had taken some of these Counterfeit Bills, return'd them to one <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName> of this City, a Journey-Man Printer, who being told they were Counterfeit Bills, did not deny the passing of them, but said, I will change them, and gave good Money for them, being in an Agony and Trembled: This was about 7 at night, and about an hour after he began to pack up his goods, and in the dead of the Night removed them; and about 3 in the Morning went off in a Boat, and we hear he landed in the <placeName>Jerseys</placeName> with design to go to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>. This being known on Tuesday Morning, caused People to examine the Bills of Credit they had by them, and said <persName>Johnsons</persName> Wife change a pretty many of them. This gave a suspicion that said <persName>Johnson</persName> was the Maker as well as Passer of these false Bills. Upon this his Excellency the Governor sent to the <placeName>Jerseys</placeName> to have this <persName>Johnson</persName> apprehended, and also called a Council and by their advice issued a Proclamation, Promising the Sum of <hi rend="italic">Fifty Pounds</hi> for the discovery of the Author or Authors of these Counterfeit <hi rend="italic">Ten Shilling Bills of Credit</hi>, which are pretty difficult to be distinguished from the True Bills, the Signers Names being nearly Imitated, but upon a nice observation there is some difference, more Particularly in the Vanes of the Wind-mill, the Flour Cask, and the Letter N in the Arms of the City of <hi rend="italic">

               <pb n="36"/>
               <q>The said <persName>Joseph Johnsons</persName> Wife was Indicted last Wednesday at the Quarter Sessions held for this City and County, for uttering several of said Counterfeit Bills, and is now in Goal in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_halle">City Hall</placeName> of the City of <hi rend="italic">

            </p>
            <p>The first action taken against <persName>Johnson</persName> was by the Court of Quarter Sessions on February 4, whose minutes read: "Whereas <persName>Joseph Johnson Bookbinder</persName> is suspected to have Counterfeited Several Ten Shilling Bills current money of this Colony; and that he lyes Concealed in this City; ordered, the Constables attending this Court do Immediately make diligent Search for the said <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName>, &amp; him to apprehend, and forthwith bring him before this Court to be Examined, and also to make diligent Search for such Counterfeit money."<ref target="#CH4-n19">

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi> disclosed, <persName>Johnson</persName> made off for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> via the <placeName>Jerseys</placeName>. The last that was known of him is a paragraph in a letter from that city which was printed in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi> of February 18, 1735, and read: "On the arrival of the Post and reading of yours, I took a Constable and went to the Lodging of <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName>, &amp; the Person where he lodged told us, that so soon as the Post came by his Door, he went out to the Office, and had not seen him since, &amp; on Sunday Morning I sent one of my Negros to his Lodging, and the Man told him that <persName>Johnson</persName> had not been at home that Night, so that I believe he is gone towards <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>, for I hear that such a Man went over our upper Ferry on <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q605122">Schoolkill</placeName>."</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Johnson</persName> left behind him in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> a small son, also named <persName>Joseph</persName>, and on May 7 the Court of Quarter Sessions made following provision for the child:
<q>Whereas <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName> aged six years the four and twentieth Day of January last past (son of <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName> late of this City, Book binder, who was lately presented in this Court for uttering a Great number of false Bills in the Room and stead of good Bills made current Money of this Colony for which he is fled from Justice and hath left the said <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName> his son, who is likely to become a Charge to the parish) It is therefore ordered, that the said <persName>Child Joseph Johnson</persName> be put out and

            <p>It has been seen that <persName>Johnson</persName>'s wife was indicted in Quarter Sessions for uttering counterfeit bills. <persName>Catherine Johnson</persName>'s case was transferred to the Supreme Court of Judicature, where on April 19 she was arraigned on an indictment for "a misdemeanour" and pleaded not guilty. Two days later <persName>Edward Mann</persName> and <persName>Garret Kettletas</persName> provided bail, each in the amount of twenty pounds, for her appearance at the next term in July. Her trial was held on August 1, and <persName>John Bell</persName>, <persName>Mr. Mann</persName>. <persName>Mr. Kettletas</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Bosch</persName>, and <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Bradford</persName> appeared as witnesses for the King. She was found guilty and on the following day was sentenced to receive twenty-one lashes on her bare back and then be discharged, paying her fees.<ref target="#CH4-n21">
                  <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
               </ref> It is likely that she had passed bad bills to <persName>John Bell</persName> and perhaps to others of the witnesses, and it may well be that her husband had been employed by <persName>William Bradford</persName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Catherine Johnson</persName> was later in serious trouble with the law: in 1766 she was convicted of stealing from one <persName>William Kirby</persName> a piece of check linen worth thirty shillings; on this occasion she pleaded her clergy, which was granted and she was burned in her left thumb in the presence of the court;<ref target="#CH4-n22">
                  <hi rend="sup">22</hi>

               </ref>

            <p>It is highly probable that six counterfeit ten shillings bills which were burnt to ashes in the presence of the grand jury in Quarter

               </ref> had been passed by either <persName>Johnson</persName> or his wife. On September 30, 1735, it was ordered by a Court of Record held at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_halle">City Hall</placeName> that the counterfeit bills formerly lodged with <persName>Robert Lurting</persName>, late Mayor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, and now in the possession of <persName>George Lurting</persName>, be by him delivered to the Clerk of the Court and that the clerk take an account of the bills when received.<ref target="#CH4-n25">

            <p>One counterfeiter, <persName>Obediah Smith</persName>, was more fortunate than <persName>Catherine Johnson</persName> had been, for he escaped punishment through the negligence of a magistrate.

Whereupon <persName>Mr. Hastier</persName> went immediately to a Magistrate and acquainted him of the Case, who desired <persName>Hastier</persName> to give notice when <persName>Flud</persName> came to him again, that he might be apprehended. He accordingly came again, with the said <persName>Steel</persName>, to the Goldsmith on <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> Morning, and said, he was glad that he had met with a Work-man for his Turn; He brought a Ten Shilling <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode-Island</placeName> Bill, and bespoke a Plate for that also, promising the Gold-smith, that he should be well rewarded, he should have Money enough, and he would supply him with those Bills. But the Goldsmith having given Notice to the Magistrate, that those Men were at his House, they were immediately apprehended; and upon Examination there were found in <hi rend="italic">

eleven Counterfeit Five Pound <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode-Island</placeName> Bills, and afterwards two more of the same sort were discovered, which <persName>Steel</persName> had passed &amp; changed that Morning. Upon their Examination <persName>Flud</persName> pretended to have come from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4929055">Andover</placeName> and <persName>Steel</persName> from <placeName>Middletown</placeName> in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Government; that they had met in their Travels at <placeName>Springfield</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>, and had been in pursuit of Iron-Works, and accordingly had taken a Lease of one in Partnership of one <persName>Haywood</persName> in <placeName>the Highlands</placeName>, on the Land of Coll. <persName>Beekman</persName>; and <persName>Steel</persName> being a Bloomer, and pretending to understand the business, <persName>Flud</persName> was to pay him 100 l. as a Consideration for letting him into Partnership with him, That <persName>Flud</persName> had accordingly paid him 50 l. in part of the 100 l. in the Bills now found upon him, which <persName>Flud</persName> denyes.

            <p>Some two weeks earlier the Mayor's Court, on April 16, 1739, passed sentence on one <persName>Margaret Haynnie</persName>, convicted as a public cheat for knowingly endeavoring to utter and uttering a counterfeit milled Spanish dollar made of pewter. She was condemned by the court on the following Wednesday publicly to be given twenty-one lashes on the naked back at the public whipping post. Thence she was to be taken to the <placeName>House of Correction</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, there to be kept at hard labor for three months and then to be discharged.<ref target="#CH5-n8">

The Impression looks some-what feint and obscure in comparison with the Original, and done upon much worse Paper. Upon the Examination of the above <persName>Van Voorhees</persName> he confessed, that he had those 3 Bills of <persName>Samuel Mames</persName>, who came Passenger in the same Vessel, and went on board a Sloop for <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName> on Friday last, who (he said) had a Roll of them as big as the Small of his Leg.

            </p>
            <p>The governor and council were alarmed not only because of these false forty shillings bills but also on account of various other denominations which appeared in circulation and decided to issue a proclamation. The minutes of the council for July 3, 1739, read:
<q>This Board being Informed that Several of the Bills of Credit of this Colony of the Denomination of ten Shillings and five Shillings Struck and Issued in the year 1734 were lately altered or forged so as to make the said bills appear of a much greater Vallue than what they were originally.</q>

               <q>And the Board being likewise Informed that Several large parcells of the forty shillings Bills of Credit of this Colony Struck and Issued in the year 1737 were also Counterfeited or forged by Bills printed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> and lately Imported, And that Several of those forged or Counterfeited Bills as well as of the forged or Altered Bills abovementioned have been uttered or past in payment to many of his Matiés Subjects in this Province which Mischief if not timely prevented may tend to the great Damage (if not the utter ruin) of many of his Matiés people within the same.</q>

               <q>It is Ordered by his Honor by and with the advice and Consent of his Matiés Council that a proclamation Issue notifying the particular Informations this Board has received concerning the same which are as follow, That the false or forged bills of five pounds were altered from a five shillings bill into that vallue by raising out the word (shillings) and in the stead thereof pasting on the word (pounds) in a print of different Types at the Top of the sd. false bills as well as in the body and at the foot of them In the true five pound bill the word (five) appears in letters placed at each corner of the Escutcheon or Flourishing in the Top thereof seperate and apart each from the other and in the Circle of the Castle in the middle of the said Flourishing the letter (V) which don't appear in the forged five pounds bills.</q>
               <q>The forged ten pound bills were altered into that vallue from the ten shilling bills by raising out the word (shillings) and in the stead Thereof inserting the word (pounds) and at the Top of the said forged bills and in the body and at the bottom thereof the word (pounds) is pasted on of different Types from the rest of the bill, but in the true Ten pounds bills at the beginning of the flourishing at the Top the Letter (T) is placed &amp; at the end of that line the Letter (E) In the under part of the Flourishing underneath the Letter (T) is the letter (N) and at the end the Letter (P) and in the middle of the Flourishing towards the bottom of it is the Letter (X) none of which marks are in the bills forged and as a further mark to distinguish the true bills of this Denomination from the false the Letter (S) appears in the false bills to be in the middle of the Escutcheon or Flourishing at the Top and it is further ordered by and with the advice &amp; consent aforesd. that in the proclamation so as aforesd. to be Iss[ued] There be

            <p>The proclamation which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi> of July 9, 1739, had been slightly revised by the Attorney General but the first part of it and the description of the forged bills is almost identical with the above wording in the minutes of the council. The proclamation, however, although promising pardon to accomplices who might inform, offered no reward. The final paragraph of this document, which was signed by <persName corresp="#viaf_31089800">Governor George Clarke</persName> and dated July 3, 1739, did not appear in the minutes of the council and read as follows: "And Whereas <persName>Garrit van Vooris</persName>, who was lately committed to the Goal of this City, for uttering several of the before mentioned Counterfeit <hi rend="italic">Forty Shillings Bills</hi>, and caused a great Number of the same to be Printed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, and imported into this City, on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> Evening last broke out of Prison, and has made his escape, There-

            <p>In spite of the governor's proclamation <persName>Van Voorhees</persName> seems to have remained at large. On August 8, 1739, the minutes of Quarter Sessions contain the following entry: "Whereas <persName>Garret Van Voorhees Mariner</persName> was lately Committed for feloniously Counterfeiting the Two pounds Bills of the Current money of this Province were taken upon him and by his Direction Thirty nine of those bills which were Counterfeit Signed for which Crime before Conviction the said <persName>Garret Van Voorhees</persName> broke Gaol and made his Escape and the said Counterfeit Bills being brought into Court by the Mayor of this City It is ordered by this Court that the said Counterfeit Bills be Immediately Destroyed and Burnt.

            <p>The wide variety of counterfeit bills in circulation at this time is shown by the fact that on the following day, August 9, <persName corresp="#viaf_58946009">Abraham Depeyster</persName>, Treasurer of the Colony, brought into Quarter Sessions false bills amounting to twelve pounds, fourteen shillings and sixpence.

            <p>On October 25, 1739, a law was passed to continue the excise duty and currency of bills of credit emitted thereon, as well as to strike new bills to exchange for old ones unfit to circulate. In this act the duties of the treasurer of the colony were set forth as in the law of November 11, 1726, while those who should venture to counterfeit, alter or knowingly pass the new bills if so counterfeited or altered were to be subject to the same "Pains Penalties &amp; Forfeitures" as prescribed in the act of December 16, 1737.<ref target="#CH5-n13">

            <p>On the twenty-third of the next month the authorities in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> apprehended a counterfeiter for whose arrival they had been waiting. The <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Weekly Journal</hi> of June 23, 1740, reported that affair as follows: "Friday last was committed to our Goal a Sailor who came over Cook to <persName>Capt.

The Magistrates of this Place had received Advice of the Intention and as soon as the Ship Came in the Chests were all search'd and the Money found as above before the Man had endeavoured to pass any off. But the Bills we hear were not Signed."</p>
            <p>The man arrested was <persName>Robert Jenkins</persName> of <placeName>Salem</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, who had taken samples of genuine bills to <persName>Abraham Ilive</persName>, a printer of <placeName>Southwark</placeName>, and from him secured the counterfeits which he brought over in his chest. <persName>Ilive</persName>, after making the money, had reported the matter to the authorities in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and on December 28, 1739, had made a deposition about the matter before <persName>Andrew Stone</persName> and <persName>S.

            <p>No arrests for counterfeiting are recorded during the years 1741 and 1742, but false notes continued to circulate, especially those of five and ten shillings, as is shown by the minutes of Quarter Sessions.

            <p>There apparently exists no definite indication as to the identity of the man committed to jail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> about the end of July, so it is probable that the person was released and not prosecuted. The "Man in the <placeName>Jerseys</placeName>" referred to by the newspaper was a certain <persName>John Stevens</persName>, who was apprehended on or about October 16, 1743.<ref target="#CH5-n25">
                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
               </ref> It is surely to <persName>Stevens</persName> that the following item in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Weekly Post-Boy</hi> of December 26, 1743, refers: "A few Nights ago, a Person lately committed to the Jail of this City on Suspicion of counterfeiting our Paper-Currency, attempted to make his Escape from thence, in order to which he had got out of the Prison Window, and let himself down by Rope; but the Watch happening to discover him before he had quitted his aireal Posture, very kindly received him at his lighting, and civilly conducted him back to his Lodgings again."</p>
            <p>Although the minutes of the Supreme Court of Judicature are lost for this period, <persName>James Alexander</persName>'s brief of the case reveals the evidence used against <persName>Stevens</persName>, who was indicted at the January term of the court for counterfeiting three £3 bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. The story is, in brief, as follows. Sometime in the spring of 1743 <persName>John Stevens</persName> purchased a horse from <persName>Daniel Pierce</persName> for £3/10 and gave his note for this sum. When <persName>Pierce</persName> came for payment he noticed that <persName>Stevens</persName> had a good deal of money and not only received his £3/10 but borrowed three £3 <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bills, giving <persName>Stevens</persName> his note for £5/10. Later <persName>Pierce</persName> paid out one of the bills to a storekeeper, who returned it as false and wrote "counterfeit" on it. At that <persName>Pierce</persName> took the bill to <persName>Stevens</persName> and complained that he had given him bad money. <persName>Stevens</persName>, swearing at the person who had written "counterfeit" on it, took the bill into his house and left <persName>Pierce</persName> at the door. Within a few minutes he returned and gave what he called a good bill to <persName>Pierce</persName>, who later concluded that <persName>Stevens</persName> had merely erased the word "counterfeit" and given the same piece of money back to him again.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Daniel Pierce</persName> now gave the bill in question to his parents, <persName>Silas</persName> and <persName>Sarah Pierce</persName>. <persName>Sarah</persName> soon paid it out to <persName>Doctor Samuel Walker</persName>,
<pb n="53"/>
who claimed it was false and refused it, so that she took it back again. <persName>Doctor Walker</persName> further related the matter to <persName>Justice Nodiah Potter</persName>, who issued a warrant for the arrest of <persName>Silas</persName> and <persName>Sarah</persName>. When they, and eventually their son, had been examined by the magistrate, <persName>Justice Potter</persName> gave a summons against <persName>Stevens</persName> to <persName>Daniel Pierce</persName> for the value of the horse and also prepared a mittimus against him as a cheat in case he should appear. <persName>Stevens</persName>, however, shrewdly sent one <persName>Hepburn</persName> to appear for him at the trial, at which the jury found for <persName>Daniel Pierce</persName> in the amount of £9/16/11. The £3 bill which was the cause of <persName>Stevens</persName>' undoing was lodged with <persName>Justice Potter</persName> and subsequently endorsed "<persName>James Alexander</persName>
               <persName>Nodiah Potter</persName> No. 1." The second £3 bill had been passed by <persName>Daniel Pierce</persName> to <persName>Nathaniel Rolf</persName>, who returned it as counterfeit, and Daniel also delivered it to <persName>Justice Potter</persName> and it was endorsed "<persName>James Alexander</persName>
               <persName>Nodiah Potter</persName> No. 2." Daniel claimed that half of the third £3 bill was accidentally blown into the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q2055835">Passaic River</placeName> as he was crossing it. It may be added that <persName>Sarah Pierce</persName> once told <persName>Stevens</persName> that she feared he had done her son a damage by paying him money of his own making and she claimed often to have heard that <persName>Stevens</persName> made money.</p>
            <p>Before the case came to trial the Crown had other witnesses against <persName>Stevens</persName>. One <persName>Isaac Steele</persName> stated that on or about May 20, 1743, <persName>John Stevens</persName> of <placeName>Ash Swamp</placeName> came to his house in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5102713">Piscataway</placeName>. When <persName>Stevens</persName> entered the room there were several persons present and soon he took pen and ink and wrote this note: "<persName>Mr. Steele</persName> can you favour me with letting me have a Bill of one two or three pounds York Money." The two men soon withdrew to another room and <persName>Steele</persName> asked his visitor why he wanted a York bill. <persName>Stevens</persName> explained that he had lately lost his pocketbook with some thirty or forty pounds. He added that he had then "a large Quantity of Money by him which he could not finish for want of a pattern" and it was for this purpose that he desired a bill. <persName>Steele</persName> refused to accomodate him and told him that "if he did he should be as bad as he."</p>
            <p>A certain <persName>John Wynantz</persName> recounted a tale which did him little credit. He went, he said, to <persName>Stevens</persName> and asked if he had money of
<pb n="54"/>
his make, whereupon <persName>Stevens</persName> answered in the affirmative and produced several bills, particularly one of 40 shillings. At this <persName>Wynantz</persName> asked if he had any to put out at interest, to which <persName>Stevens</persName> replied that he had none then but "could soon get enough." When <persName>Wynantz</persName> requested some of the bills, <persName>Stevens</persName> said that they were not yet finished. When his visitor inquired on what terms he let out money, <persName>Stevens</persName> informed him that "he trusted to Mens Generosity but several had acted like Knaves by him." <persName>Wynantz</persName> added that <persName>Stevens</persName> once gave him a 40 shillings bill of his make to see if it would pass, whereupon he showed it to one <persName>Robert North</persName>, who took it to be a good one. When <persName>Wynantz</persName> returned the bill to <persName>Stevens</persName> again, <persName>Stevens</persName> said he could do even better and that "no man in the Government could come near him."</p>
            <p>Before long, however, the men of the government quite literally did "come near him," for on October 16, 1743, <persName>William Chetwood</persName>, <persName>Samuel Burrows</persName>, and several other persons, armed with a warrant, went to <persName>Stevens</persName>' house and took him in custody. In searching a chest there they found three pieces of paper with several marks on each in the shape of Bills of Credit of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. These papers <persName>Chetwood</persName> took to <persName corresp="#viaf_53152838">Robert Hunter Morris</persName>, <persName>James Alexander</persName> and <persName>Elisha Parker</persName>, and the papers were endorsed with their names and those of <persName>Chetwood</persName> and <persName>Burrows</persName> and numbered on the back 1, 2, and 3. <persName>Robert Morris</persName> delivered them into the hands of <persName>James Alexander</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n26">

            </p>
            <p>The conduct of <persName>Wynantz</persName>, by his own account, was most improper, to say the least, and others whose testimony was desired as evidence for the King at the trial were apparently apprehensive that they in turn might be prosecuted if they ventured into the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. The governor's council learned that several of the witnesses living in East <placeName>Jersey</placeName> had been frightened by <persName>Stevens</persName>' emissaries, who, it seems, said that <persName>Stevens</persName> would turn King's evidence "and impeach all those who should come to appear against him." The minutes of the council for July 17, 1744, which are concerned with this matter, read:
<pb n="55"/>
               <q>And it being of the highest consequence to this Colony that the said <persName>John Stevens</persName> should be prosecuted with the utmost Rigour of the law to deter others from the like pernicious practices for the future. His Excellency by and with advice of his Majesty's Council for this province was pleased to declare and doth hereby declare and assure all persons whatsoever who shall Come to give evidence agt the said <persName>John Stevens</persName> at his Tryal at the next Supreme Court shall be safe in their persons and freed from any Arrest, Imprisonment or punishment whatsoever for their being concerned with him the said <persName>John Stevens</persName> as an accomplice in the crime afd. and shall if required have their pardons under the Great Seal of this province for their offences committed as accomplices with him and also will be protected by the Supreme Court agt all other arrests whatsoever.<ref target="#CH5-n27">

               <persName>John Stevens</persName> was by no means the only money maker at work in 1744. On May 11 of that year the governor signed a warrant for £26/2 to <persName>George Joseph Moore</persName> for money paid by him on account of the prosecution of a counterfeiter of the bills of credit of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n29">
                  <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
               </ref> It is possible that the criminal was <persName>Stevens</persName>, though the amount of money expended would suggest that <persName>Moore</persName> had pursued investigations of considerable extent and perhaps outside the province. Indeed, it was reported from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> on August 2: "A Fellow was this Morning taken up and committed to our Goal, for Counterfeiting the Bills of Credit of several of the neighbouring Governments: He was discover'd by <persName>Tom Bell</persName>,<ref target="#CH5-n30">

               </ref> A second dispatch from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, dated one week later, threw further light on this matter. "Five or six Men and two Women," it read, "are apprehended and committed to our Goal as Accomplices in counterfeiting the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Five Shilling and Forty Shilling Bills, of the Year 1737, and Search is making after others concerned. The Bills are printed from a Plate, very ill engraved, and the Signer's Names to the Five Shilling Bills, are engraved and printed with the Bill. Their Mint was in a Log-house, in a remote Part of the <placeName>Jerseys</placeName>. The Discovery was first made by <persName>Tom Bell</persName>, to whom one of the Gang applied, endeavouring to engage him to be concern'd with them, and to assist in signing their Bills.

            <p>There was apparently a subsequent examination of <persName>Moore</persName> taken upon oath on September 9 before the mayor and one of the aldermen of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>. It was read before the governor and council on September 12 and added the details that <persName>Killet</persName> and <persName>Ryan</persName> coined 150 false dollars at the house of a certain <persName>Patrick Phagan</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>. <persName>Moore</persName> also asserted that the pair coined more than 400 false dollars and some doubloons in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3573345">Bermuda</placeName> while he was there.<ref target="#CH7-n3">

            <p>
               <persName>Moore</persName> himself, as was reported in the <hi rend="italic">American Weekly Mercury</hi> of August 15, 1745, was convicted in the Supreme Court on August 5 of passing counterfeit milled pieces of eight, knowing them to be such, and on August 8 he was given thirty-nine lashes at the public whipping post. On August 13 he was supposed to stand in the pillory (and doubtless the sentence was carried out) "and there part with some Memorials of his Honesty, as the just Reward of his Ingenuity."</p>
            <p>Another case of the counterfeiting of Spanish coin was discovered when at a court of general sessions of the peace of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5129915">Orange County</placeName> held
<pb n="70"/>
at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4835128">Goshen</placeName> on October 31, 1745, one <persName>Jacob Maser</persName> pleaded guilty to an indictment for striving to pass brass pieces for Spanish pistoles. The Court imposed a fine of five pounds and costs.<ref target="#CH7-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> This amazingly light punishment was doubtless due to the fact that the last law imposing severe penalties – – imprisonment for a year and a day and forfeit of all goods and chattels – – for the counterfeiting of foreign gold and silver coin had expired in 1718. On the heels of the crimes of <persName>Killet</persName>, <persName>Ryan</persName>, <persName>Moore</persName> and <persName>Maser</persName> came a dispatch, dated <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, November 21, which was published in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Weekly Post-Boy</hi> of November 25. It stated: "Several counterfeit Pistoles made of fine Brass, have lately appeared among us. They may be known by their extream Lightness; a Piece of Brass equal in Bulk to a Piece of Gold, not being quite half its Weight."</p>
            <p>This situation, and above all the activities of <persName>Killet</persName>, <persName>Ryan</persName>, <persName>Moore</persName> and <persName>Maser</persName>, led the assembly to pass on November 29, 1745, a law fixing the penalty of death without benefit of clergy for those convicted of counterfeiting or passing certain foreign coins. The first line of the act read as follows: "Whereas Evil disposed Persons have Lately attempted to Counterfeit the Spanish French &amp; Portuguese Gold Coins &amp; the Spanish Pieces of Eight &amp; other Spanish Silver Coins imported in to this Colony, To the great Hurt &amp; Damage of the Inhabitants for the Prevention thereof for the future..."<ref target="#CH7-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> Thus the same penalty was fixed for the counterfeiting of either the bills of credit or foreign gold or silver as mentioned above.</p>
            <p>The circulation of false bills also continued at this time, for on September 10, 1745, at a Court of Oyer and Terminer for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4952349">Suffolk County</placeName> four counterfeits, one of £3, two of 10/, and one of 5/, were presented and burnt in the presence of the court. 5 On May 7, 1746, the Mayor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> brought into Quarter Sessions three false bills, one of £10 and two of £5, while Justice <persName>Brandt Schuyler</persName> at the same time produced one of 5/.<ref target="#CH7-n6">

            <p>In 1747 the authorities succeeded in taking up four members of a gang of counterfeiters. As early as March 21, 1747, <persName>Governor Law</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> wrote to <persName corresp="#viaf_38325070">Governor Shirley</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>: "I would inform your Excellency That here has been taken some Counterfeit Plates among which are a 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi> or 8<hi rend="sup">l</hi> and a 9<hi rend="sup">d</hi> or 3<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Plate of your money and 'tis thôt great Use has been made of them. one man now in Irons (who has since delivered up the Plates) is secured in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839366">New haven</placeName> Goal."<ref target="#CH7-n7">

The same paper of July 6, 1747, in an item headed "<placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>, July 6," stated: "There are now no less than four Persons in the Goal of this City, taken up on Suspicion of counterfeiting Gold and Silver Coin, viz. <persName>John Bellemy</persName>,<ref target="#CH7-n8">

<pb n="72"/>
               <persName>Justice Horsmanden</persName> and read by the board. Thereupon the council ordered that the names of the several persons concerned therein who did not reside in the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> should be notified to the several governors of the neighboring provinces in which the said persons resided in order that they might speedily be apprehended and brought to justice.<ref target="#CH7-n9">

               </ref> Since the minutes of the Supreme Court of Judicature for this year are lost and since no further newspaper account is to be found, the outcome of the case is not known.</p>
            <p>Soon the people of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> were plagued by the appearance of false bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>. <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette, revived in the Weekly Post-Boy</hi> of October 26, 1747, warned: "The latest Impression of the <hi rend="italic">

And the next issue of the newspaper did carry the promised description of the 15/ denomination of the emission dated July 2, 1746, the counterfeits of which were "just beginning to appear." The description read:
<q>The Paper of the Counterfeits is thin and smooth, and when look'd thro' in the Light, appears fair and free from Knots: The Paper of the true Bill is thicker, rougher, and when look'd thro' in the Light, appears clouded and uneven: The Counterfeits are wholly done from a Copperplate, the Back as well as the Foreside; the true Bills are printed from common Types, in the common Printing-Press: The three Crowns by the Side of the Arms in the Counterfeits are unlike each other, and more round than those of the true Bills, which are like each other, and the same with thus <graphic url="NNM127_081a.jpg"/>: The Flowers above and below those Crowns in the true Bills the same with this <graphic url="NNM127_081b.jpg"/> in the Counterfeit they are nothing like: The Value of the Bill just over the Signers Names in the true Bills, is the same Characters as here XV SHILLINGS. <graphic url="NNM127_081c.jpg"/> in the Counterfeits the Letters of the Word <hi rend="italic">Shillings</hi> are larger. There are many other Marks by which they may be distinguished, but these, we hope, will be sufficient at present.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Within the same month two other denominations of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> currency had been counterfeited and the <hi rend="italic">

               <q>There is likewise a great deal of Difference in the Border of Flowers round the Sage Leaf on the Back; the flourishing being more open, loose and irregular, in the Counterfeits than in the true Bills; and the Strokes that represent the Fib[er of the] Leaf, not appearing so naturally rough as they do in the true Bills. The Letter S in the Word SIX, at the Top of the Counterfeit Bill, is much smaller than the IX, and the Letters in the Word SHILLINGS, at the Top of the Counterfeit stand very crooked.</q>

"I have reason to believe," he said, "there is a Knot, or Combination of villainous Persons, that are making a Trade of forging the Bills of this Province; And this Matter well deserves your speedy Care and strict Enquiry, as it strikes at the very Vitals of your Currency, and so must nearly affect not only your Commerce, but your other Estates also."<ref target="#CH7-n10">

This is published to put People on their Guard, and that if possible the Authors of this Villany may be discovered."</p>
            <p>At about the same time altered money appeared, for the same newspaper of October 9, 1752, warned: "Last Week a <placeName>Jersey</placeName> One Shilling Bill was pas'd in this City for Six Shillings; the Word <hi rend="italic">One</hi> being cut out, and the Word <hi rend="italic">Six</hi> put in, and the other Parts of the Bill so defac'd, as not to be distinguish'd at first Sight, but may easily be known on close Examination: As there may possibly be more of the same sort People are caution'd to beware of them."</p>
            <p>In October of this year a strange case concerned with the passing of, apparently, counterfeit coin is found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5129915">Orange County</placeName>, where on the last Tuesday in the month one <persName>Peter Bakcas</persName> appeared as a defendant before the Court of General Sessions of the Peace.

               </ref> As the law passed on November 29, 1745, fixed the penalty of death without benefit of clergy for anyone convicted of knowingly passing false Spanish, French or Portuguese gold coins, it would almost seem that <persName>Bakcas</persName> must have been passing uncoined pieces of base metal for gold and hence received the comparatively trifling fine of two pounds.</p>

He had left his pocketbook at the house of one <persName>Edmund Robinson</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, presumably in or near <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>. <persName>Thomas Dote</persName>, a constable, was sent to the house with other persons upon orders of a justice of the peace, and in <persName>Bellemy</persName>'s purse found a counterfeit pistole, about eighty pounds of counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode Island</placeName> money, and a false <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> five shilling note. The above information is contained in the deposition made by a certain <persName>Stephen Barnes</persName>, a blacksmith, on October 7, 1747, before <persName>Chief Justice John Kinsey</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>.

Thus, on May 1, 1753, in Quarter Sessions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> the mayor produced four false bills, one of £10, no. 79, one of £5, no. 210, one of £2, no. 4344, and one of £1, no. 2542, all of which were destroyed before the court.<ref target="#CH8-n1">

            <p>A grand jury, headed by one <persName>Noah Gillett</persName>, on June 8, 1753, presented three persons, <persName>Benjamin Chase</persName>, <persName>Jacob Mace</persName> and one "Solevin," alias <persName>James Shiffel</persName> or <persName>Benjamin Parlon</persName>, for stamping <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode Island</placeName>

<q>The Publick are caution'd to beware of Counterfeit Forty Shilling Bills, that have been lately brought and issued in this Province; they are artfully done, and Persons of small Attention can not readily apprehend the Fraud: For the Benefit of unwary People we give the following Description of the false Bills differing from the true Ones, <hi rend="italic">To wit, First</hi>, They are all dated <hi rend="italic">December</hi> 10, 1737, marked lx. ∫. and are signed, <persName>Peter Schuyler</persName>, <persName>Peter Jay</persName>, <persName>Stephen Wood</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, 1737 in the False, seems something larger than in True. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, And so is the Letters lx. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, the II. 1, under the

            </p>
            <p>These false forty shilling bills appear, with other denominations, among those produced during 1754 in Quarter Sessions. On February 6, 1754, the following counterfeits were brought into that court: one of £3 and one of 20/ by the Mayor; nine of 20/ by <persName>Alderman Benson</persName>; one of £5 by <persName>Alderman Cortlandt</persName>; one of £10, three of 40/, and one of 20/ by <persName>Alderman Livingston</persName>.<ref target="#CH8-n7">

            <p>This prevalence of £3 counterfeits called forth, as might have been expected, this warning in the <hi rend="italic">

            <p>On September 16 the same newspaper gave a further description which read:

               <graphic url="NNM127_093.jpg"/> where the Stroke in the Middle goes quite through: But in the true Bills the Stroke in the Middle goes but half way," and point 5, "After the above <persName>Mark</persName> in the false Bills, are two Flourishes something like ω which are closed: But in the true Bills there is a Space between inclosed. something like ᴜ."</p>
            <p>It has been shown that eleven false 20/ bills were produced in Quarter Sessions at its meeting on February 6, 1754. It is then small wonder that the governor's council took up the matter on March 18, when the governor informed the board that <persName>John Livingston</persName> had delivered to him two letters containing information about counterfeit twenty shilling bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>.

said, had been arrested and searched, and nineteen more bills of the same denomination and date were found in his pocket. The other letter, dated March 7, from <persName>Matthew Greswold</persName>, Attorney General of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>, to <persName>Captain Durfey</persName>, advised that it was necessary to send one of the said twenty shilling bills to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> in order that the difference between that and the true bills might be pointed out.</p>
            <p>The advice of the council on this matter was that the Governor "desire the Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> would be pleased to give directions for the said <persName>Key</persName> to be sent here, in order for his Tryal, assuring him that any request of the like nature will be readily complyed with on the part of this Government. But if the said <persName>Key</persName> should be tryed there (where if convicted he can only receive corporal punishment) and it should appear on Examination that he can and will discover any accomplices, That his Honour in this case be pleased to desire that Government to send the said <persName>Nathaniel Key</persName> hither to be examined as an Evidence against such accomplices, with Promise on this Condition of his receiving his Majesty's most gracious Pardon."<ref target="#CH8-n10">

            <p>The knowledge that <persName>Sullivan</persName> had left his plates in the hands of his accomplices occasioned the passing on July 9, 1756, of a law entitled "An Act more effectually to Suppress and prevent the Counterfeiting of the Paper Currency of this Colony."

            <p>So serious was the evil in that county that two of its justices of the peace, <persName>Jacobus Ter Bos</persName> and <persName>Matthew Du Bois</persName>, in behalf of themselves and other inhabitants of the county, on November 1, 1757, petitioned <persName>De Lancey</persName>, humbly showing:

               <q>That by reason of War and the Incursions of the Enemy a Considerable time hath elapsed since there hath been any Court of Assize or Goal Delivery in this County, and in all probability if the war continues may not be held for some time to come, by which means the said Prisoners may have further opportunity to make their Escape and pass unpunished.</q>

            <p>It is not improbable that much of the counterfeit money circulating in the province in 1758 originated with the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5115580">Dutchess County</placeName> Gang.

               <hi rend="bold">A</hi>n act was passed on December 16, 1737, to prevent the further importation into <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> of copper money. If any was brought in for more than the amount of ten shillings, it was subject to seizure, and one third of any thus confiscated was to go to the informer, whether the money was found on ship or on shore. The master of every vessel was required to report any copper money on board.<ref target="#CH9-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> There appears, however, to have been no special interest in the matter until an article appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Independent Reflector</hi> of May 24, 1753, in which the writer dealt with the overvaluing of copper pence in the Province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> and pointed out that it paid to import them.</p>
            <p>If it was worth the while to import genuine halfpence, it would naturally be much more profitable to introduce counterfeits into the colony, and this is exactly what happened. A dispatch dated <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, August 6, appeared in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> Weekly News-Letter</hi> of August 16 and read as follows: "The Publick are desired to take Notice, that <hi rend="italic">Some</hi>, who undoudtedly have the <hi rend="italic">Welfare of their Country much at Heart</hi>, have lately introduced among us, a large Quantity of bad <hi rend="italic">Half pence</hi>; last Week a Gentleman in this City, found no less than 36 s. in a Bag of 6 l. the Means of their Discovery were, their weighing 2 <hi rend="italic">lb</hi>. less than they should do. They are cast in Sand, look very rough, fil'd round the Edge, Letters bad, very thin and light, and may as well be discovered by the Sound, as any other Method of Tryal; and 'tis suppos'd are some of those that were so current in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> some Time ago, and offer'd to Sale there for 7 d. per <hi rend="italic">lb</hi>.

            <pb n="103"/>
            <p>On September 27, 1753, <persName>Mr. Draper</persName>, publisher of the same <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> newspaper, printed the following communication which had been addressed to him:
<q>
                  <persName>Mr. Draper</persName>, For the Warning of all Persons from being cheated by counterfeit <persName>Copper Money</persName>, I desire you to insert in your Paper a publick Letter I have just now received from <persName>Mr. Agent Bollan. J. Willard</persName>. <placeName>Pall-Mall</placeName>, July 9, 1753.</q>
               <q>"Some Months past great Quantities of counterfeit Half-pence were made at <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName>, each of them being considerably less in Value than a Farthing, and many of them passed in Payments before the Fraud was known; but after its Discovery, the Government by seizing diverse large Parcels of them, and taking other proper Measures, sometime past entirely prevented their further Currency here: Whereupon, as I have lately understood, large Parcels of them were collected together in order to be sent to <hi rend="italic">

                  </hi>, to be passed off in Payments there, part whereof according to my Intelligence was shipt in some of the last Ships and the rest are intended to be sent in some of the next. I have endeavour'd to find out what now remain here with a Design to have them immediately seized, having made the proper Application for that Purpose, but have not yet been able to meet with them: Whether my Motions, or any thing else will prevent their being shipt off according to the Intent of the Parties who collected them, I cannot say; but think it my Duty to send you this Intelligence, so that this villanous Design may not take Effect in the Province."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The false coins, as foreseen, made their way to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName>, where, during the last week in October, 1753, a great number of them were uttered. A search was instituted and several bags of the halfpence were found in the custody of a passenger come from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> on the last ship in under the command of <persName corresp="#viaf_53512278">Captain Cary</persName>.

                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> and the result was an act, passed on December 12, 1753, to prevent the importation or passing of counterfeits of British halfpence or farthings.<ref target="#CH9-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> By this each person importing the coins or causing them to be imported was subject to a fine of £100; the passers of such money were to pay a forfeit of ten times the value, on the oath of an informer, while the justice of the peace had full power if the amount involved no more than £6. Any person to whom these counterfeits were offered was to seize them and take them to a magistrate. Passers were liable to make good the sum if the recipient delivered the money to a magistrate within a week. In disputes over these false pieces, if the sum was under 40/, their goodness could be determined by a justice. In the case of larger amounts, the justice on request was required to take two freeholders to assist him in reaching a decision. Each year the court of sessions was to have the false halfpence and farthings melted down, sell the metal, and give the proceeds to the overseers of the poor for the use of the needy. Anyone knowingly retaining these counterfeits in his custody for ten days was to be treated as if he were an importer of them.
<pb n="105"/>
Finally, a search warrant was to be issued if information on oath was given to a magistrate.</p>
            <p>To cope with the chaotic condition brought about by the circulation of the false copper coins, some seventy-two merchants and shopkeepers of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> drew up and signed on December 18, 1753, a manifesto. They pointed out that the halfpence were short in weight and alloyed. Money, they remarked, for which a sinking fund was not provided, had to be considered in the light of its intrinsic value. They continued:
<q>In regard to Pennies, how shall we sink, or where ship them? Certainly no where, while they pass at such an unreasonable Rate, higher than in any His Majesty's Dominions; and this unhappy Colony must, in the End, be the general Sink of all that worthless Money, and when the Remedy is found absolutely necessary (and that such a Time must come, needs no Argument to prove it) how wretched and confused shall we be to reflect, that tho' we saw the Evil growing every Day more and more burthensome, we wanted Steadiness to administer a Remedy, 'till the Disease became incurable, without shocking the whole Frame. At Home, while they have Copper in the Kingdom, they cannot follow a better Business than supply us in the Manner above stated; nor can all the Monies this Colony has, put together, strike at its Quiet and Interest more effectually.</q>
               <q>The above Reasoning, clearly shews the Necessity there is, for every true Lover of his Country, to endeavour as much as in him lays, the reducing Pennies to <hi rend="italic">Fourteen</hi> for a Shilling.</q>
               <q>We the Subscribers, being sensible that the Importation of <hi rend="italic">British</hi> Copper Half-Pence, is prejudicial to the Interest of this Colony, and a great Means of depreciating our Currency, legally established, Do, for the Prevention thereof, on our Words of Honour, declare, That we will not, after this Day, receive Copper Half-Pence, otherwise than Fourteen for a Shilling, and that we will pay them away at the same Rate; provided Fifty of the principal Merchants of this City, sign this Paper, In that Case we hereby give Leave to the Printers in this City, in their next Week's News-Papers, to make this our Resolution publick.<ref target="#CH9-n7">

In short, the Generality of the Inhabitants of this City, are now so truly sensible, that the lowering of the Pence to fourteen to the Shilling, will be attended with salutary Effect, that very few, if any, will now take them any other Way."</p>
            <p>The situation, however, led to a riot in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> and three persons were arrested, one man for beating a drum, and <persName>Wendal Ham</persName> and <persName>Mathias Sleght</persName>, who, it was alleged, encouraged the mob to riot by throwing halfpence among them.<ref target="#CH9-n9">

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> Weekly News-Letter</hi> of January 24, 1754. It read:
<q>The Papers shew you what have been done about the Penn(ies) but it is yet uncertain whether they will go at Twelve or Fourteen to a Shilling. They not only refuse the Taking of the Pennies lately counterfeited, but all that have not a plain Head and Tail of <persName>King William</persName>, which you know are very many; all those of the same King, which look any Thing whitish. I give you this Caution in Time, that the Rubbish be not palm'd upon the Pennsylvanians.</q>
               <q>Pennies of bad Copper are easily detected, by making them red hot, and striking them with a Hammer, which will make them fly to Pieces; while good Copper will bear forging in a red hot State, and in a lower Degree of Heat, like Iron.</q>

            <p>In <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, however, according to a letter of January 16, 1754, there was not the least talk of taking the pence at twelve to a shilling.

Harrison</persName>, <persName>Surveyor</persName> and <persName>Searcher</persName> of his Majesty's Customs for the Port of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> on Tuesday morning last seized in a Store in this City, and the Whole lodg'd in the Hands of <persName>Alderman Filkin</persName>'s. <hi rend="italic">Such Assiduity as this, in making two considerable Seizures within a Fortnight's Time, will, we trust, be an effectual Step towards preventing the Importation of counterfeit Copper Halfpence, into this Province, so prejudicial to the Country in general, and the fair Trader in particular; and will, undoubtedly, reflect no less Honour on one so zealous for the good of the Common Weal, than Dishonour on the Person or Persons who may at Times import them, contrary to the express Words of the Act of Assembly of this Province, lately made and provided in that Behalf</hi>."</p>
            <p>The confidence of the public in the halfpence was, quite naturally, undermined, so that the same paper on April 24, 1754, printed this comment:
<q>The Confusion among the Inhabitants of this Place, occasioned by the Counterfeit Half-pence, seems to increase daily; and the Infatuation of Mistrust, if it may be so termed, is so unaccountable, that the <persName>King William Half-pence</persName>, are now almost universally refused as counterfeits, altho' it is certain, that there are fewer of that sort bad, than of others; and that they have been passing amongst us without Suspicion these many Years: – – – At the lowering of Half-pence it was a popular Cry, that the Merchants did it, with a Design to ship them away, and now we are taking
<pb n="109"/>
the only possible Measure to oblige them to do it, by refusing almost all of the <persName>King William Half-pence</persName>, even against the Convictions of our own Sense and Reason, on Pretence of their being counterfeits; whilst we know, they are only worn with Use, or scratch'd a little by the Boys playing chuck-farthing with them in the Sand. Where or how this unreasonable Practice will end, God knows; but methinks, every Individual of us, should reflect seriously on the ills we are bringing on ourselves, and which more or less every one must daily feel (unless they are those Incendiaries that imported the bad Ones) and for our own sakes, cause the Matter to be speedily determined; for as we have a greater Number of those Half-pence than others amongst us; we should either continue the Currency of all that are not counterfeits, or else absolutely refuse them all at once; which last will be found to be a heavier Tax than the lowering them; besides the depriving the Place of so much of its running Cash; and yet to continue under the present Infatuation is an Evil greater than either.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Apparently the author of the above need not have been so alarmed, for the panic seems to have subsided soon after this. <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Mercury</hi> of May 16, 1754, informed its readers that the previous week <persName>George Harrison</persName> had made another seizure of between £30 and £40 of counterfeit British halfpence. With that notice the matter disappeared from the public press, and it may be presumed that the legislation that had been enacted, the energetic searches and seizures made by <persName>Mr. Harrison</persName>, and the new rating of the coins largely cured the evil.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">I</hi>n June, 1761, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> was plagued with a flood of altered <placeName>New Jersay</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bills. The first warning of their appearance was sounded by the following item in [<persName>Weyman</persName>'s] <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi> of June 8: "The Public is desired to be cautious how they receive <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName> SIX POUND Bills, as there are Counterfeits of that Denomination now in this City. – – They are dated April 10, 1759, and are made out of <hi rend="italic">Six Shilling</hi> Bills of the same Date. – – The Words <hi rend="italic">Six Pounds</hi>, are ill done with common printing Types, on the Erasure of the Words <hi rend="italic">Six Shillings</hi>; and the Word <hi rend="italic">Ounces</hi> is in larger Letters than those the Bills are printed with.

            <p>On June 22 [<persName>Weyman</persName>'s] <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi> published another caution: "The Public are desired to be cautious how they receive <hi rend="italic">

noticed by the Erasure of the Word <hi rend="italic">Two</hi>, both in the front and left Escutcheons, and the Word <hi rend="italic">Ten</hi> nicely stamped in with printing Types, vastly plainer than in those of the true Bills. – – The Emblem of the <hi rend="italic">Two Pound</hi> Weight in the Middle of the <hi rend="italic">Forty Shillings</hi> Bills, are likewise almost erased, and two Letters, thus (V V) struck in their Stead, in Imitation of those of the true Bills." The <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Mercury</hi> which appeared the same day also warned of the counterfeit ten pound bills, which, it stated, were dated April 21, 1760. It noted that the E and N on every part of the bill were pasted on and appeared smaller than the T. "The V on each of the Weights," it concluded, "are pasted on also, as is the X at the Left Corner, and all the Figures throughout the Bill." Finally the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi>: <hi rend="italic">or, the Weekly Post-Boy</hi> of June 25 repeated the description given in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Mercury</hi> but gave the date of the bill as April 2, 1759, and suggested that the bill be held to the light in order to discover the letters or figures pasted on.</p>
            <p>This same number of the newspaper, which appeared on Thursday, stated that on the afternoon of Tuesday three men, one of whom had long been an inhabitant of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, were apprehended and committed to jail on suspicion of altering <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> two pound bills to ten pound bills. The account continued: "Soon after their Commitment, one of them made a pretty ample Confession of the Fact, and is the same Person in whose Custody the counterfeit Six Pound <placeName>Jersey</placeName> Bills mentioned in this Paper two Weeks ago, were found... It is said, there are some others concern'd, who are absent in order to distribute some of these Bills, but that proper Measures are taken for securing them, and there is no honest Man but what must sincerely wish they may all meet with a Reward suitable to their Demerits."</p>
            <p>On the same day that the suspected counterfeiters were arrested, June 23, the magistrates proceeded to examine the prisoners. One examination read thus:

            <p>It would seem that <persName>Dawson</persName> was not taken, as his case was not to come up at the April term. The fate of <persName>Lewis</persName> and <persName>Cooley</persName> is not known, as neither the newspapers nor court records yield any further evidence. There does exist, however, a document in which the attorney general marshalled the evidence to be presented by each witness against <persName>Richard Cooley</persName> "on Tryal 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> April 1762." The evidences for the King were <persName>Daniel Sullivan</persName>, <persName>Elizabeth Bellknap</persName>, <persName>Robert Bren</persName>, <persName>Joseph Whitehead</persName>, <persName>William Depyster</persName>, <persName>Jacobus Rosevelt</persName>, <persName>Jne Markel</persName>, <persName>Michael Butler</persName>, <persName>Lewis Hamilton</persName> and <persName>Mary Van Kueren</persName>. The notes, because of their brevity and disjointed nature, are not absolutely clear, but the story they tell is essentially as follows. <persName>Cooley</persName> and a certain <persName>Chase</persName> came to the house of <persName>Daniel Sullivan</persName>, who changed a bill for them, giving them twenty-five dollars for it. Later <persName>Sullivan</persName> told one <persName>Lewis</persName>
               <pb n="117"/>
               <persName>Hamilton</persName> of a ten pound bill he had received of a <persName>Captain Skinner</persName> but <persName>Hamilton</persName> believed it had really been passed by <persName>Chase</persName>. <persName>Hamilton</persName> evidently was suspicious of <persName>Cooley</persName> and told <persName>Sullivan</persName> he was sorry for <persName>Cooley</persName>, since a man had paid <persName>Cooley</persName> for a wig with a bad bill. <persName>Sullivan</persName> then went to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_halle">City Hall</placeName>, taxed <persName>Cooley</persName> with passing the bill, and <persName>Cooley</persName> begged him to burn the bill, promising to repay him a dollar at a time by making wigs for <persName>Sullivan</persName>'s lodgers. He refused, however, to tell who had given him, <persName>Cooley</persName>, the bill.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Cooley</persName> went to the shop of <persName>Elizabeth Bellknap</persName> and bought some china, for which he offered a ten pound bill. <persName>Mrs. Bellknap</persName>, as she could not change it, sent it to a neighbor, <persName>Mr. Markel</persName>, for that purpose. <persName>Mr. Markel</persName> said that his negro wench brought him the bill but, as he deemed it false, he sent it to the mayor.</p>
            <p>Again, <persName>Cooley</persName> gave a servant a ten pound bill and asked him to take it to <persName>Mrs. Mary Van Kueren</persName>, from whom he was to purchase some linens. <persName>Mrs. Van Kueren</persName> sent her wench with the bill to be changed to <persName>Jacobus Rosevelt</persName> and <persName>William Depyster</persName>, both of whom refused it as false. She also sent it to a <persName>Mr. Boswell</persName>, who returned it with the message that it was counterfeit. She then went in person to <persName>Robert Bren</persName> and desired him to come to her house, as a man was buying linens there and had a false bill of ten pounds denomination. <persName>Cooley</persName> was next summoned, and, when he came, admitted that he had given the bill to <persName>Mr. Whitehead</persName>'s servant. <persName>Cooley</persName> was then taken to <persName>Alderman Benson</persName> and, it seems, placed under arrest.</p>
            <p>The evidence which <persName>Michael Butler</persName>, apparently an innkeeper, gave was to the effect that in March, 1761, he saw <persName>Cooley</persName>, <persName>Higgins</persName> and <persName>Dawson</persName> upstairs in a room with two soldiers. He heard one of the soldiers say he would not do it, while the other insisted he should. Later he noticed that <persName>Higgins</persName>, <persName>Cooley</persName> and <persName>Dawson</persName> went privately up to his garret, and, suspecting that they were about making false bills, he followed them upstairs but met them already coming down.<ref target="#CH10-n8">

            <p>The hanging of <persName>Higgins</persName> did not put an end, even for a short space of time, to counterfeiting and passing. On February 3, 1762, the mayor produced in Quarter Sessions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> a five shillings bill altered to five pounds and another of five shillings altered to ten shillings, with the numbers defaced on both bills. He also brought in a counterfeit bill of £3, no. 527, and a false one of £2, no. 13652.<ref target="#CH10-n9">

            <p>One counterfeiter and passer of the cobb type of dollars was apparently <persName>James Campbell</persName> of <placeName>Orange Town</placeName>, yeoman, who on February 3, 1763, agreed with one <persName>John Peterse Smith</persName> to lodge with him.

<pb n="122"/>
               <q>In our last we cautioned the Public to beware of counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName> Three Pound Bills, dated in 1761; and Thirty Shilling Bills, dated 1762 and 1764; since which we have seen the following Counterfeits of that Money, viz. Three Pound Bills, two different Sorts of Twelve Shilling Bills, and a Six Shilling Bill. They are all badly done on Copperplate, the Letters being very irregular, and standing much out of the Line; whereas the true Bills are neatly and regularly done, in the common printing Manner. In the first Line of the Face of the Counterfeit Three Pound Bills, the O in POUNDS is shorter and thicker than the other Letters in that Word; and in the third Line the last E in <placeName>JERSEY</placeName> is not like a Printing E, but is made in the Manner commonly used in Writing. — The Twelve Shilling Bills are both dated April 12, 1760. one Sort may be discovered by having a black Line about the Flowers which are around the T, in the Word THIS; also in the Arms, the lower Part of the Unicorn's Body appears naked, and the Words in the Garter, and of the Motto, are plainer than in the True Bills; and at the Back instead of the Printer's Name, <persName>Parker</persName>, it is made Parke. The other Sort is printed on Writing Paper; in the third Line, after the Word Ounce, instead of [<graphic url="NNM127_131a.jpg"/>] Fifteen, is made [<graphic url="NNM127_131b.jpg"/>] Fifteen. – – The Six Shilling Bills are dated December 31, 1763; in the Escutcheon, in the Word <placeName>JERSEY</placeName>, the J is made Bottom upwards; in the third Line, the S in <placeName>JERSEY</placeName> is smaller than the other Letters of that Word; and in the next Line, after Grains, is of which should be of — The above Counterfeits are all printed on three Folds of Paper, pasted together (except the last of the Twelve Shilling Bills) but the true Bills are only on two Folds. In short, they are all so ill executed, that we think, after this Notice, no Body can be imposed on by them. The Three Pound Bills are dated April 8, 1762.</q>
               <q>There have likewise appeared some <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName> Three Shilling Bills altered to Twelve, by having the Word Twelve pasted over the Place where Three should be, which may be discovered by its looking fresher than the other Part of the Bill.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The person responsible for the appearance of these false <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills was one <persName>"Captain" John Davis</persName>. The <hi rend="italic">

He was removed from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5129915">Orange County</placeName> jail and on April 8th lodged in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_halle">City Hall</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>.<ref target="#CH11-n2">

               </ref> The grand jury on April 22 preferred two indictments against <persName>John Davis</persName>, late of the City of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, laborer: one was for deceit in passing counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills and the other for deceit in procuring false <placeName>Jersey</placeName> bills of credit to be passed. It was in the latter specifically charged that <persName>Davis</persName> on January 23, 1766, in the <placeName>West Ward</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> delivered to <persName>Michael Smith</persName> three counterfeit £3 bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> and four 30 shilling bills of the same province and to <persName>William Gilliland</persName> three 30 shilling <placeName>Jersey</placeName> bills with the intent that these men pass the false bills in question. It was also charged that on that day <persName>Smith</persName> passed off <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> counterfeits as follows: one of £3 to <persName>John Divan</persName>, one of £3 and one of 30/ to <persName corresp="#viaf_68776681">Moses Sherwood</persName>, one of 30/ to <persName>Theophilus Hardenbrook</persName>, one of £3 to <persName>John Plantaine</persName>, one of 30/ to <persName>Arnout Cannon</persName>, and one of 30/ to <persName>John Cox</persName>. The jurors also presented that <persName>Gilliland</persName> passed three false bills, one of 30/ to Dennis McCreedy, one of 30/ to <persName>William Newman</persName>, and one of 30/ to <persName>John O'Bryan</persName>. The witnesses for the King included <persName>Smith</persName>, <persName>Gilliland</persName>, the persons to whom they passed the bills, and also <persName>James Leary</persName>, <persName>John Mott</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_36952581">Joseph Towers</persName>, <persName>Catharine Johnson</persName>, <persName>Susannah Burrows</persName>, <persName>Thomas Welch</persName>, <persName>William Chease</persName> and <persName>Mary Chease</persName>.<ref target="#CH11-n3">

            <p>The following day in the Supreme Court <persName>Davis</persName> pleaded not guilty. He was tried on April 24, when, together with some of those mentioned above, <persName corresp="#viaf_2272186">John De Noyelles</persName> and <persName>Mary Clarke</persName> gave evidence against him. The jury convicted him on both indictments, and on July 31 the court sentenced him to stand on August 6 in the pillory for one hour
<pb n="124"/>
between the hours of ten and twelve in the forenoon. Then he was to be committed to the custody of the Sheriff of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> until the first Thursday in the October term and from then until bail should be given in the amount of £500 by himself and in the amount of £250 each by two sureties for his good behavior for one year from the date of such recognizance.<ref target="#CH11-n4">

               </ref> On November 1, 1766, <persName>Davis</persName> entered into the prescribed recognizance, as did his two sureties, <persName>Dennis Hicks</persName> of Peeks Kill, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144050">Westchester County</placeName>, ship carpenter, and <persName>Thomas Martin</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, skinner.<ref target="#CH11-n5">

               <persName>Davis</persName>' agents, <persName>Michael Smith</persName> and <persName>William Gilliland</persName>, were indicted, <persName>Smith</persName> on April 22 for deceit in passing counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> bills. Two days later <persName>Smith</persName> entered into a recognizance in the amount of £100, with two sureties, <persName corresp="#viaf_68776681">Moses Sherwood</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, vintner, and <persName>John Young</persName>, of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, vintner, each in the amount of £50, for <persName>Smith</persName>'s appearance before the Supreme Court in July. On August 1, however, when three proclamations were made and no one appeared to prosecute, the court ordered that he be discharged, paying his fees.<ref target="#CH11-n6">

            <p>The Supreme Court on August 26 ordered the attorney general to file an information against <persName>Gilliland</persName>, who was to stand committed until he should provide bail on the same terms as <persName>Smith</persName> to appear at the July term. The information "for passing <placeName>Jersey</placeName> Counterfeit Bills of Credit" was filed on July 29 and on the next day he pleaded not guilty.

               </ref> During the October term of the court in the following year <persName>Gilliland</persName> was again indicted, this time for allowing men and women of bad name in his house "Drinking Tipling whoreing and misbehaving themselves," of which he was convicted, and he was sentenced to stand an hour in the pillory,

            <p>Others probably implicated by <persName>John Davis</persName> were <persName>Bernardus Bratt</persName>, <persName>Daniel Coe</persName> and <persName>Jeremiah Knap</persName>. <persName>Bratt</persName> was apparently indicted for a "deceit" the same day as <persName>Davis</persName> and <persName>Smith</persName>, and on November 1, 1766, a jury gave judgment for the King against <persName>Bratt</persName>.<ref target="#CH11-n9">

On May 14 at a court of general sessions of the peace of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5129915">Orange County</placeName>, held at <placeName>Orange Town</placeName>, <persName>Coe</persName> and <persName>Knap</persName> were presented by a grand jury "for passing Counterfeit Bills."<ref target="#CH11-n10">

At that court, held in <placeName>Orange Town</placeName> on May 12, 1767, <persName>Coe</persName> was called and, when he did not appear, his recognizance was respited until the following day. He again did not appear and it was ordered that his bail be forfeited.<ref target="#CH11-n11">

               </ref> It would seem that he feared conviction and fled.</p>
            <p>It was the activity of <persName>Davis</persName> and his accomplices which caused the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> assembly to pass on July 3, 1766, an "Act to make it Felony without Benefit of Clergy to counterfeit the Bills of Credit of any of his Majesty's Colonies, which pass in Payment in the Colony of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>." As has been noted, <persName>Davis</persName> was indicted and punished after conviction merely for a "deceit," since his counterfeits were the bills of another province. The new act, intended to deal with such situations by fixing the most severe penalty, read:
<q>WHEREAS many evil disposed and wicked Persons have lately counterfeited, and circulated in this Colony, large Parcels of Bills, in Imitation of

            <p>Although the plague of false <placeName>Jersey</placeName> bills had been checked, New Yorkers had to be on their guard against counterfeits of their own currency and also spurious dollars. In Quarter Sessions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> the mayor produced the following counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bills: at the meeting of February 4, 1766, one £10 bill altered from a 40/ bill, no. 19355 and dated April 2, 1759, a £6 bill, no. 82061, dated July 1, 1714, a £2 bill, no. 2263, dated April 20, 1760, and also two 40/ bills without any number and dated April 21, 1760; at the session of August 7, 1766, fifteen 40/ bills, of which three bore the numbers 5362, 173 and 5650 respectively, while the remaining twelve, all dated April 21, 1760, were neither numbered nor signed.<ref target="#CH11-n14">

            <p>Warnings to the public about false dollars in circulation began to appear in the press in November, 1766, and continued into June of the next year. The <hi rend="italic">

<q>The Publick are hereby caution'd to beware of counterfeit Dollars, many of which have lately been discover'd. They are so well finish'd, as hardly to be distinguish'd from good ones by a close Inspection. We have only now an Opportunity to describe those of one of the Dates, viz. Ferdinand's of 1747. The Metal is rather duller than the generality of the true ones, and often one Side or t'other a little scratch'd as if touched with a File, the Size a small Matter broader and thicker, and does not ring so well as the true ones. The Inscription is nearer to the Edge of the Metal on one Side than the other, and the indenting on the Edges is less distinct and neat than the true ones, but the most remarkable Distinction is on the Edge right over the Point (.) after FERDND. on the Arms Side; and over the Rose, after VNUM, on the Pillar Side, where there is in some of them an Inequality, in others a Flaw, as if in that Place the Metal had been pour'd into the Mould.<ref target="#CH11-n17">

            <p>It is probable that some of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> forty shillings bills were the handiwork of <persName>Gideon Casey</persName> and his associates, and he may also have made some of the false dollars against which the public had been cautioned.

<q>Last Week the <persName>Hon. WILLIAM SMITH</persName>, jun.

Bag containing all the Instruments for coining and milling of Dollars, of the Years 1763, and 1764, Plates for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4482348">North-Carolina</placeName> Money, Instruments for making Pistereens, and several Forty Shilling Bills of this Province, dated April 21, 1760. They were all committed to Goal, and being examined, <persName>Casey</persName> said, that some of the bad Bills were passed in this City but that all the Instruments were left in his Possession about three Years since, and given to him by one <persName>Howe</persName>, a noted Money Maker from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> Government.</q>

            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Supplement to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Journal; or, the General Advertiser</hi> of February 20, 1768, reproduced the account from the <hi rend="italic">

            <p>Two days later the <hi rend="italic">

our Jail on Suspicion of counterfeiting Money; five of which were committed to Jail there for Trial, the other four admitted to Bail; It is said they have Confederates in several other Governments, and it is to be hoped the Bottom of that iniquitous Affair will now be discovered."</p>
            <p>The outcome of proceedings in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4834157">Fairfield</placeName> was given by the <hi rend="italic">Supplement to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Gazette</hi> of March 24, 1768, in a dispatch from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839366">New Haven</placeName>, dated February 26. It read: "Last Friday, pursuant to the sentence of the Superior Court, then sitting at Fairfirld, <persName>Archibald Fippeny</persName>, <persName>Lewis Bennet</persName>, <persName>John Mallet</persName>, and <persName>Nathaniel Bunnell</persName>, were crop't, and branded with the letter C on their Foreheads, for counterfeiting the lawful money bills of this colony, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> bills, dollars, &amp;c. – – Seven others, were try'd, at the same court, on suspicion of being their accomplices, with them in the same crimes, but the evidence not being sufficient to convict them, they were discharged. – – <persName>Seth Porter</persName>, and — — — <persName>Sturges</persName>, not chusing to be try'd forfeited their bonds for appearance, the former one thousand pounds, and the other five hundred. – – They were in partnership with a gang lately taken up at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> ..." The newspaper then briefly told the story of the apprehension of <persName>Casey</persName> and his party and added that on their schooner were found recipes for smelting and varnishing metals.</p>
            <p>It might have seemed that <persName>Casey</persName> and the four with him would have been convicted and punished, but such was not the case, and the printer of the <hi rend="italic">

It may be added that <persName>Joshua Howe</persName>, who had supposedly left counterfeiting equipment with <persName>Casey</persName>, was taken in April at <placeName>Cohass</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5090174">New Hampshire</placeName> and committed in that province on suspicion of counterfeiting dollars.

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette; and the Weekly Mercury</hi> of April 18, 1768, in recounting <persName>Howe</persName>'s arrest, commented: "It is said there is a Clan of these Gentry of at least 500, who correspond thro' all the Colonies,

as far as <placeName corresp="#geonames_4482348">North-Carolina</placeName>. <persName>Howe</persName> denies being concerned in manufacturing any money, but acknowledges he lets out certain Tools at ten Dollars per Day."</p>
            <p>Perhaps one member of the counterfeiting "clan" was a certain <persName>William Stevens</persName>. All that is known of him is that on January 4, 1769, he came under bail into the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5115580">Dutchess County</placeName> and his appearance was entered in the minutes, while the following day <persName>Justice Humfrey</persName> delivered a counterfeit forty shillings bill of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> and it was sworn to <persName>William Stevens</persName>.<ref target="#CH11-n20">

            <p>One person who in all probability was connected with <persName>Gideon Casey</persName>'s gang was <persName corresp="#viaf_78711114">John Jubeart</persName>, whose arrest was thus reported in the <hi rend="italic">

            <p>Two other <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> newspapers of the same date added other details. The <hi rend="italic">

<q>On Thursday last one <persName corresp="#viaf_78711114">John Jubeart</persName>, was committed to Goal for passing false Dollars.

his being detected and threatened to be carried before a Magistrate, he endeavoured to make his Escape, and went into the <placeName>Old Slip-Market</placeName>, where he buried some Dollars among a Parcel of Rubish, which were taken up by some People who had observed him, and produced at his Examination. — The Public are desired to observe, that the Mounts upon the Side of the false Dollars, instead of being raised are indented, and the Milling upon the Edges open and distinguishable from a Genuine Spanish Dollar.</q>

<q>Tuesday last an elderly Man who calls himself <persName corresp="#viaf_78711114">John Jubeart</persName>, was apprehended and carried before a Magistrate in this City, on suspicion of counterfeiting Spanish Mill'd Dollars: – – He had pass'd two or three of them, with different Persons, one of which, suspecting the Fraud, detected him, whereupon he pretended to want to ease himself, and went down to the Dock, where he was seen to attempt hiding something in the Dirt, which being searched, a Purse with six more Dollars of the same kind, and several Implements for counterfeiting were found. On his Examination he said, he was born on <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q18432">Staten-Island</placeName>; was a Blacksmith by Trade, and had formerly followed that of a Tinker, in all the Colonies from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4482348">North-Carolina</placeName>: – – That he had lived near three Years past at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4952078">Stockbridge</placeName> in <hi rend="italic">

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Journal; or, the General Advertiser</hi> of November 23, 1769, printed a <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> dispatch, dated November 16, cautioning people to beware of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> twelve shilling bills dated June 22, 1756. They were done with common printing types; the arms were badly cut, as also the leaf on the back; the face and back were printed on two pieces of paper pasted together, not as thick as the true bills, and the counterfeits appeared much soiled to prevent their being detected; the number and signer's names seemed to be written by the same hand and in the same ink and appeared to be done lately; the names of the signers were not intelligible.</p>

It then gave the following description of them: "They are very badly cut, and stamped; the letters most irregular, and in general larger than the true bills; the arms, and other ornaments, ill done, and appear very pale: The Three POUNDS, at the top of the bill, are placed at a greater distance from the left-hand ornament, than in the true ones. The A, in the Word April, remarkably large, and the THREE

POUNDS, at the bottom of the bill, considerably larger than in the true bills. There are two sorts of them, but both so badly done, that they may easily be detected, after this notice. The backs appear to be done with a pen, and the word <placeName>Woodbridge</placeName>, in some of them, is spelt <placeName>Woodbrige</placeName>." The same notice was printed in the <hi rend="italic">

The counterfeits were on a paper of a blueish cast; the number was indistinct; the sage leaf was imperfect, for the part where it rises from the stem was cut off; the arms were distinct and plain and the
<pb n="144"/>
border was plain and open, resembling a vine with leaves. The red letters were deeper than in the true bills and of a purple cast; the letters were ill formed, disproportionate, and irregular, particularly in the word "Shillings" at the top of the bill.</p>
            <p>Another counterfeited <placeName>Jersey</placeName> bill [<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X] was thus described in the same newspaper of February 3, 1772: "Several Counterfeit <placeName>Jersey</placeName>

            <p>Before the end of June there came a further development. The <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette; and the Weekly Mercury</hi> of June 29, 1772, published a dispatch dated <placeName corresp="#geonames_5223593">Newport</placeName>, June, 22, which read as follows:
<q>Last Tuesday <persName>James Bud</persName> and <persName>Lemuel Gustine</persName>, Were apprehended and committed to goal in this town, on suspicion of being concerned in counterfeiting and passing <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> and <placeName>Jersey</placeName> paper money. About a week before, they, with some others, came from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4944911">Nantucket</placeName> in a sloop, and anchored in <placeName>Mackerel Cove</placeName>, a little within our light house, where these two left her and came to this town, and agreed, with an engraver to cut them a plate for the escutcheon or border of a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> forty shilling bill, for which purpose they cut out the printed part of the bill, and gave the engraver the other part cut into three or four pieces. But before the engraver had quite finished the plate, he accidentally saw a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> bill, which Bud had passed to another man, by which he discovered the real business he was about, and immediately informed <persName>Judge Hazard</persName> of
<pb n="146"/>
the same. After Bud and <persName>Gustine</persName> were examined, the sloop was brought into this harbour, and being searched, upwards of fifty pounds of <placeName>York</placeName> and <placeName>Jersey</placeName> money was found, including a small sum Bud and <persName>Gustine</persName> had about them. They confessed but little on the examination: But it might be easily perceived that one <persName>Wills</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>, one <persName>Smith</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, and a number of others were concerned in this affair.</q>
               <q>The money above mentioned consists of sixty, twenty, ten and five shilling bills, principally of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> currency, most of which are well known to be counterfeits; the <placeName>Jersey</placeName> bills are doubtful, and may probably be some of those taken out of the treasury when robbed.<ref target="#CH12-n19">
                     <hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                  </ref> There is one five pound bill not signed: The forty shilling bill by which the plate was to have been made, is a true one.</q>
               <q>By what could be drawn out of these men, there must be a very considerable amount of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> bills counterfeited to the Westward; as Bud confessed that he saw a great number lying on <persName>Wills</persName>'s table the first time he went to see him.<ref target="#CH12-n20">
                     <hi rend="sup">20</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The two men, according to the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224151">Providence</placeName> Gazette</hi> of June 27, 1772, had been in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224151">Providence</placeName> some ten weeks before, had passed counterfeit bills there at that time, and then had gone eastward and purchased a vessel, supposedly with false money.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that someone, probably an associate of Bud and <persName>Gustine</persName>, tried to secure types, perhaps to print in the letters on bills from the plate which Bud and <persName>Gustine</persName> were to have obtained. The <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Gazette; and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> Weekly News-Letter</hi> of July 2, 1772, stated: "Tuesday last a Person applied to the Printer hereof, for a Number of Types; and said they were for printing some Lines to go to the Bottom of a Family Coat of Arms, 5 of which had been done for as many Brothers by the Name of <persName>Sutton</persName>. There were about a Dozen Lines, ten Words in a Line, and did not seem applicable to any Arms; upon Enquiry, he said he came from the Borders of
<pb n="147"/>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Government, by which it was suspected he wanted the Types for some other Design, and was dismissed."<ref target="#CH12-n21">

            </p>
            <p>The apprehension of Bud and <persName>Gustine</persName> came to the notice of the governor and council of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. His excellency reported on June 25, 1772, to his board that he had received information that several persons had lately been arrested and committed to jail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode-Island</placeName> for passing counterfeit bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>. He had also heard that a number of persons were collected together at <placeName>Pittsfield</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5115580">Dutchess County</placeName> and, the better to answer their wicked purpose of counterfeiting the bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, formed themselves into a company called the Money Company, and, although it was generally known there, yet, from their number, the magistrates were deterred from taking the proper steps to punish them. The council thereupon advised the governor to write to the justices of the peace in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5115580">Dutchess County</placeName>, exhorting them to a vigorous and active execution of their authority and to use every method in their power to break up so dangerous a combination by apprehending and bringing the offenders to justice.<ref target="#CH12-n22">

            </p>
            <p>On July 1, 1772, the matter came up again in council, for Chief <persName>Justice Horsmanden</persName> delivered to the governor a letter which he had received from <persName corresp="#viaf_75245173">Metcalf Bowler</persName>, a justice of assize in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode Island</placeName>, dated June 20 and inclosing the examination of <persName>James Bud</persName>. When this had been read, it was recommended that the chief justice take the proper measures to have Bud and <persName>Gustine</persName> brought to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> for trial and it was ordered that the expenses of bringing them be defrayed by the province.<ref target="#CH12-n23">

               </ref>

            <p>Bud was tried in October at the Superior Court held in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5223593">Newport</placeName> for passing counterfeit money. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was fined £100 and costs.<ref target="#CH12-n24">

<pb n="148"/>

            <p>There is, however, much more evidence concerning another supposed confederate of <persName>William Hooker Smith</persName>, namely <persName>Felix Meigs</persName>, a boatman. On July 30 four indictments were filed against him and on July 5 a fifth one. They were as follows: for passing on June 10, 1772, at <placeName>Montgomery Ward</placeName>, a false £3 <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bill to Arabela, the wife of <persName>John Rutter</persName>; for passing on June 5, 1772, at the Out <persName>Ward</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, a counterfeit £3 <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bill to <persName>Jacob Shourt</persName>; for passing on June 10, 1772, in <placeName>Montgomery Ward</placeName>, a false £3 bill of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> to <persName>Philip Rhinelander</persName>; for passing on the same day and in the same ward another spurious £3 bill to <persName>Vincent Montanije</persName>; and finally for passing on June 5, 1772, in the <placeName>Dock Ward</placeName> of the City, a false £3 bill to <persName>Catherine Dumont</persName>, to all of which he pleaded not guilty.<ref target="#CH12-n27">

            </p>
            <p>For some unknown reason <persName>Meigs</persName> was not tried on the last indictment but instead on another for passing a £3 bill to <persName>John Lockhart</persName>. A certain <persName>John Outhout</persName>, brother of <persName>Catherine Dumont</persName>, made a deposition which shed some light on <persName>Meigs</persName>' actions before he was taken into custody. The text of this document read:
<q>Evidence of <persName>Mr John Outhout</persName> says that on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Day of June, his <persName>Sister Catharine Dumont</persName> gave him a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> Bill of Three Pounds and two Bills of 5/ which this Deponent immediately declared to be counterfeited, that he went in Pursuit of the Person who had passed the said Bills but could not find him untill the next Day, he heard that a Person had
<pb n="149"/>
been detected in paying false money at the East End of <persName>Town</persName>. — That this Deponent then went to <persName>Alderman Blags</persName> where he was informed that the Alderman and a Man who had passed the false money were gone down to the white <persName>Hall</persName>, in Quest of a Person of whom it was pretended the false money had been rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. for a Moses Built Boat, but no such Person could be found, that this Deponent met <persName>Alderman Blag</persName> on the white <persName>Hall Dock</persName>, and informed him that he was in Quest of a Man who has pass'd a false Three Pound Bill &amp; two five Shillings Bills at this Deponents House for a Piece of Callico <persName>Alderman Blag</persName> then told the Deponent he would bring the man to the Deponents House which he did the tenth Day of June, the Man at first denyed having bought any thing at that Shop, but on being reminded by this Deponent of some Circumstances which happened confessed that he had purchased a Piece of Callico there, for which he had given the said Three Pound &amp; five shilling Bills shown him by this Deponent being the identical Bills now in this Deponents Possession — that this Deponent then went with the Man to his Boat, where he opened his Chest and delivered to him the said Piece of Callico That this Deponent does not recollect the Person's Name who passed the said false Three Pound &amp; five Shillings Bills, but heard he was committed to Prison, where he still is, and this Deponent would know him on seeing him again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the close of the above is added the evidence of <persName>John Lockhart</persName>, who said that about the end of May a man came to his shop, asked for some linen, and requested that he cut off five yards of this.

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette; and the Weekly Mercury</hi> of October 5, 1772, revealed that a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bill [<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI] had been counterfeited also. The account was headed "COUNTERFEITS" and read:</p>
            <p>The Publick are hereby notified, That within these few Days, Counterfeit <hi rend="italic">Three Pound</hi> Bills have made their Appearance amongst us, so well executed that it requires the greatest Care to discover them from the true Bills, and are supposed to be done by a Copper plate, constructed on a new Method, that is, by <hi rend="italic">raising</hi>, instead of, <hi rend="italic">sinking</hi> the Letter, which makes the Bills appear as if done with a printing Type. The Bills are dated, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>, February 16, 1771. The <hi rend="italic">false</hi> Bills may be discovered from the <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, by the following Observations: The <persName>Mark</persName> III L at the Bottom of the Print of the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> Bills, near the Arms stand regular, in the <hi rend="italic">false</hi> they are irregular, the first I standing higher than the other two, and the L is sunk much below the Line of the other two II's. The upper part of the Letter K, in the Word NEW-YORK, in the <hi rend="italic">false</hi> Bills, is blotted, and the Comma at the End of the K is split; in the <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, the K and Comma stand fair; — in general the Counterfeits may be discovered by the Face of the Bill, the Paper being smooth as if worked in a rolling Press, and the Arms and Escutcheons are better executed than in the true Ones. These remarks must suffice for the present.</p>
            <p>There was good reason for the provincial authorities to be concerned both for their paper currency and for the foreign coin which

circulated. On October 21, 1772, <persName corresp="#viaf_24873135">Governor Tryon</persName> communicated to his council a letter, dated October 3, which he had received from <persName corresp="#viaf_102326774">Sir William Johnson</persName>, advising that sundry persons from <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> had lately in their traffic with the Indians passed many counterfeit Spanish dollars, three of which had been delivered to him. <persName>Sir William</persName> sent these counterfeits to the governor and expressed the fear that if some means were not quickly devised to prevent this imposition on the Indians, they might retaliate by carrying off the horses and cattle of the whites. It was advised by the council that <persName>Sir William</persName> recommend to the Indians that they exert themselves in apprehending all such offenders, that they might be brought to justice.<ref target="#CH13-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Early in November great numbers of counterfeiters were discovered in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106841">Albany County</placeName>. The <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette; and the Weekly Mercury</hi> of November 9, 1772, reported: "We hear, that a few Days ago no less than 9 Men were committed to Goal in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName>, on suspicion of being concerned in counterfeiting our last Emission of Paper Money, as a Quantity of the same, and many bad Dollars, with Instruments for operating on both, were found in their Possession." Even more would, doubtless, have been imprisoned, had it not been for the large numbers concerned and the support they received, even, in one case, at least, from constables.</p>
            <p>The seriousness of the situation is revealed by a letter sent to <persName corresp="#viaf_24873135">Governor Tryon</persName> on November 24, 1772, by <persName>John Munro</persName> of <placeName>Fowlis</placeName>, a justice of the peace of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106841">Albany County</placeName>. He wrote:
<q>It is with the greatest reluctance that I would offer to trouble your Excellency with any more complaints but when the Public Interest and the wellfare of this Government is so much conserned, I think it my indispensible duty to report the same to your Excellency.</q>
               <q>My chief business for these Ten days past was nothing but taking Examinations of Felons and their associates of which this country abounds.</q>
               <q>I have now in my Custody the <persName>Stamps Moulds Mills</persName> and several other Materials for coining of Dollars (dated 1760) one crown piece dated 1752,

one dollar dated 1766, and one dated 1768 which are all counterfeits &amp; found in the custody of <persName>John Searles</persName> of <placeName>Arlington</placeName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_24021853">Comfort Carpenter</persName> of <placeName>Shafsbury</placeName> which with their own confession upon Oath, was sufficient Evidence to me and after discovering from them all that I could upon Oath I wrote their Mittimus and sent them off to Goal in the charge of two constables and desired as many to their assistance as they thought necessary — the same night they suffered <persName>Carpenter</persName> to make his Escape, then one of the said Constables pursued after <persName>Carpenter</persName> and the other went to Goal with <persName>Searles</persName>, but stoped upon the Road ten days and at last let <persName>Searles</persName> go about his Business.</q>
               <q>What can a Justice do when the whole Country combinds against him — The very night that I sent these two to Goal some of their associates Brock and Destroyed one of my Potash works, which cost me upward of fifty Pound my property is destroyed night and day &amp; durst not say Ill done — by the confession of these Felons (there is a line of money makers from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> to a place called the <placeName>Cowas</placeName> back of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5090174">New Hampshire</placeName>) I have got the names of 17 more. I have sent after them, but I know that the Constables will not be faithfull for they are its my opinion less or more conserned — <persName>Mr Justice Morison</persName> has declined Serving and I hope your Excellency will be pleased to Excuse my acting any longer for I got myself ruined by the conduct of My Good Neighbour...<ref target="#CH13-n4">

The most noted of these Offenders is one <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>, who was at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144336">White Plains</placeName>, whither <persName>Colonel Elijah Williams</persName>, a Gentleman of Character, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> Government, accompanied by an Officer, who had a Warrant from the above-mentioned Justices, went in Pursuit of him, and by an uncommon Dispatch, apprehended the Offender, before he had the least Intimation of his being discovered. There were found in the Possession of the different Offenders, several Plates for striking three Pounds and five Shillings, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Bills, and <placeName>Jersey</placeName> Bills of different Denominations, also two Presses and a Quantity of Types; a Stamp for Dollars, and other Implements, with a Quantity of Bills, some finished and some unfinished.

<q>We hear from the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930396">Berkshire</placeName>, That about five weeks since one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName>, issued his Warrant against several persons of the <persName>Towns</persName> of <placeName>Sheffield</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4952078">Stockbridge</placeName> upon a suspicion that they had been concerned in counterfeiting the Bills of Credit of the province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>.

<pb n="158"/>
declined <persName>Mr. Woodbridge</persName>'s Offer, expressly declaring that such Proceedure would not answer what they proposed to effect. And thereupon immediately and very abruptly left <persName>Mr. Woodbridge</persName> and proceeded thro' the <persName>Town</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4938157">Great-Barrington</placeName> (wherein resided three Justices for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930396">Berkshire County</placeName>, two of whom, viz. <persName>David Ingersoll</persName>, jun. and <persName>Mark Hopkins</persName>, Esqrs. were learned in the <persName>Law</persName>) to the <persName>Town</persName> of <placeName>Sheffield</placeName>, to <persName>Joshua Ashley</persName>, Esq; who granted a Warrant according to their Wishes; by Virtue of which the said Sheriff apprehended those Persons and hastily dragged them out of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930396">Berkshire County</placeName> into the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName>, where they were very rigorously and partially treated, and directly hurried away to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName> Goal, then greatly infected with the Small Pox. Some of them have since been seized with that contagious Distemper and died, and there has been a special Court appointed to try those who survive.

               <q>At the last Court of Oyer and Terminer and Goal Delivery held at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName>, there were five persons convicted, to wit, <persName>William Hulbert</persName>, <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>, <persName>John Wall Lovely</persName>, <persName>Gilbert Beletier</persName> and <persName>John Smith</persName>.

But that a late act having included the place within the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName>, he was under the Necessity of trying them there, and that unless his Excellency shall think it proper to interpose a pardon, the same Act will oblige him to proceed to Judgment. And that if Mercy should be extended to any one of them only, he would recommend <persName>William Hulbert</persName>, who tho evidently guilty had made an ample Confession, and has been instrumental in discovering the principal Offender one Bill, as appears by a Certificate of the <persName>Justices Adgate</persName> and <persName>Whiting</persName> and his own Confession.<ref target="#CH13-n17">

In fact, he claimed that he had sold a good horse for them and further that the people to whom he passed the bills at first took them but some time after on close inspection found that they were bad. He asserted also that the person who returned them to him was repaid with good money but did not give back the false bills and also prosecuted him. The petition closed with the plaint that he had been born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and thus had neither friend nor relative to whom he might apply.<ref target="#CH13-n22">

               <persName>Justice Woodbridge</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4952078">Stockbridge</placeName> in his "resentment" made certain charges to Governor <persName>Hutchinson</persName> against <persName>Colonel Williams</persName>, Sheriff of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930396">Berkshire</placeName>, and <persName>Justice Ashley</persName>, relative to their conduct against counterfeiters, and all this was reported to <persName corresp="#viaf_24873135">Governor Tryon</persName> in a letter, dated <placeName corresp="#geonames_5123400">Kinderhook</placeName>, February 10, written by <persName>H. van Schaak</persName>.<ref target="#CH13-n28">

            <p>Feeling in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>, however, had been aroused over the affair, and on February 20 the council and General Assembly of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> passed a resolution protesting the arrest and detention in jail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName> of <persName>Gilbert Belcher</persName> and others, inhabitants of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930396">Berkshire County</placeName>, for crimes alleged to have been committed west of the line.<ref target="#CH13-n30">
                  <hi rend="sup">30</hi>
               </ref>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_27892715">Governor Hutchinson</persName> on February 20 wrote to <persName>Tryon</persName> enclosing the resolution passed by the council and House of Representatives of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>. It was requested that the sentence of <persName>Gilbert Belcher</persName> and the other inhabitants of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> be not carried out unless it were proved that they had committed crimes to the westward of the line allegedly submitted to by both provinces for several years.</p>
            <p>After consideration of the situation the council on March 1 advised <persName corresp="#viaf_24873135">Governor Tryon</persName> that the law should take its course and that a committee of the board should formulate reasons for this opinion that they might be communicated to <persName corresp="#viaf_27892715">Governor Hutchinson</persName>. This committee, headed by <persName>William Smith</persName>, on March 3 made a lengthy and highly informative report. It pointed out that four of the convicted counterfeiters had committed their crimes beyond twenty miles to the eastward of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q3140">Hudson River</placeName> and that one of them, <persName>William Hulbert</persName>, had been pardoned, leaving <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>, <persName>John Wall Lovely</persName> and <persName>Gilbert Belcher</persName> subject to capital punishment. The committee further noted that for many years the province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> had treated the counterfeiting or altering of its currency – – no matter where the crime was committed – – as felony without benefit of clergy. The committee conceived this practice "is founded upon the aggravated Nature of the Offence, and the great and invincible <persName>Law</persName> of Necessity, for if the mere Circumstance of Counterfeiting the Coin of any Country, beyond the precise Line of its Territory, will render the agent dispunishable, the power of providing for the publick safety,
<pb n="164"/>
a power essential to every Legislative Body, cannot be enjoyed in its proper Extent, and this pernicious practice will receive such Countenance and Encouragement, as must be subversive of Commerce and Confidence, and all the Security of Civil Society."</p>
            <p>No act, the report continued, passed for this purpose was disallowed by the Crown nor until now had given umbrage to any of the neighboring colonies, some of which had assisted in the surrender of offenders to the justice of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. The committee expressed surprise at the intervention of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> for such criminals and also alarm, as the principle on which the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> government seemed to proceed appeared unfriendly to all the colonies, especially at a time when complaints of the corrupting of the currency of the provinces was general and the practice was prevalent in several parts of the continent. The intercession of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>, in the eyes of the committee, seemed to spring from a principle "that renders it impossible to every one of the Colonies to prevent the Corruption of its Coin, and leaves them only the power of punishing the Offence of passing it, an Offence rarely to be proved from the Difficulty of evincing the Scienter, an Offence less malignant than that of coining the Money, and which if this Solecism in polity, is to be submitted to, must nevertheless pass with Impunity, tho the Offender be apprehended within the Limits of the province that is injured."</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_27892715">Governor Hutchinson</persName>, the committee pointed out, claimed that the authority of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> extended only to a line twenty miles east of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q3140">Hudson River</placeName> and that the offence of <persName>Belcher</persName> and the others, being committed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930396">Berkshire County</placeName> to the east of the said line, was by the law of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> no more than a trespass. In answer to this the committee asserted that, even if the jurisdiction of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> up to a line twenty miles east of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q3140">Hudson River</placeName> had been uncontrovertable, it might be expected that an excess of eagerness on the part of constables in capturing the criminals
<q>would scarce have exposed them to censure, since the Guilt of such Offenders ought to render them obnoxious as pirates are by the <persName>Law</persName> of Nations to be proceeded against in the Courts of all States to what Prince
<pb n="165"/>
soever they may be Subject — and tho' the Committee does not mean to assert that a Counterfeiter of public Coin of any Country is subject to the same universal <persName>Law</persName>, yet from the peculiar Malignity of the Crime and its extensive and pestilent Effects the Obligation upon Colonies (which tho' independent of each other are nevertheless connected by the indissoluble Ties of Interest and Subject to the same Sovereign) to act upon a principle of mutual Sympathy, seems to stand upon so solid and immovable a Foundation, as that which justifies independent Nations in proceeding against the Subjects of any other State for such Crimes as are incompatible with human Safety – – Instead therefore of complaining of the Execution of our Laws against such enormous Offenders, we might rather have expected the Aid of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Bay for their punishment, and that by <persName>Laws</persName> of their own they would have conspired to prevent the Infraction of ours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The committee observed that <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> did not complain that any <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> officers had crossed the aforesaid twenty mile line armed with the authority of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> against offenders. And, if they had, the territory from the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q3140">Hudson</placeName> to the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q379648">Connecticut River</placeName> was as much subject to the jurisdiction of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> as of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>. It added that the late act of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> including lands to the eastward of the twenty mile line was "to prevent any Conclusions from being drawn to the prejudice of our Claims in future."</p>
            <p>The report continued:
<q>It was therefore a mere Accident that these Criminals were tried in the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName>, thô the Event has however shewn the Act to be of use in a much more important Article than the Legislature had in Contemplation when it was framed.</q>
               <q>But for that Act, the District in Controversy would have been the only place where the Currency of this province might have been counterfeited, and the Counterfeiter unimpeachable, thô apprehended in the Colony and clearly chargeable with the Fact: For as the <persName>Laws</persName> made to Guard against the Corruption of our Currency Stood before that Act was passed, the Counterfeiter in that Quarter could not have been prosecuted at all, it having escaped the Legislature to provide against the Commission of the Offence, at a place within the Province and yet not within any of its Counties.</q>
               <pb n="166"/>
               <q>And as there is good Reason to believe that a very great part if not all the false Money in Circulation, was made in this very district, the province would have been reduced to the disagreeable Necessity of passing an ex post <persName>Facto Law</persName> or of considering the Agents in this infamous Traffic as chargeable with no Crime, unless they could be convicted of passing the Bills knowing them to be counterfeited.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There was, the report held, no reason for any interposition in their favor even if their crimes had been committed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> or any other place beyond the territorial extent of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. The report continued as follows:
<q>The Offence of counterfeiting the publick Coin by the Laws of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and of many other States is punished as a Species of Treason, and it seems strange to the Committee that so henious an Act should nevertheless by the Laws of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Bay be considered merely as a Trespass, for which the party injured is only to be recompensed in Damages, as thô it was a meer private Wrong committed without Force.</q>
               <q>To the extreme Laxity of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> Laws towards this Species of Offenders it may be owing that the Bills of Credit of this Colony are so generally and greatly disparaged. No less than thirty six Indictments were found against the Makers and passers of false Money at the late Court in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName>. New Offenders have been since apprehended and await their Trials in several other Parts of the province. False Bills to an Amount of more than twelve hundred Pounds have already been Stop'd by the Magistrates, and we hear of fresh Discoveries of Knots of Money Makers in divers Places, so that some exemplary punishment seems to be requisite not only in Justice to the public, but in Mercy to Individuals, who by the blameable Indulgence of Government, may be induced to participate in the Guilt of an Offence that threatens an almost universal prevalence in all parts of the Continent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It appeared that the prisoners had no grounds to complain about the conduct of the court by which they were tried. The only point they made was that their offence was in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> a trespass but in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> a felony. The committee, however, observed that these criminals would have suffered death if their offence had been com-
<pb n="167"/>
mitted in any other colony and that the infliction of that penalty now would probably be a motive to hasten the settlement of the boundary dispute between the two provinces. Further, the committee added, the including of the disputed land in the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName> was no more blameable than its inclusion by <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> in the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930396">Berkshire</placeName>.<ref target="#CH13-n31">

<q>I opened the Court of Oyer &amp; Terminer the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Instant, &amp; on Friday passed Sentence of Death on <persName>Joseph Bill</persName>, <persName>Gilbert Belcher</persName>, and <persName>John Wall Lovely</persName>. — Their Execution is ordered on the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of April.

It read:
<q>
                  <persName>John Wall</persName>, and two others were executed here yesterday, for being concerned in counterfeiting the Paper Currency of this province: — <persName>Wall</persName> was a hardened villain, and I believe a great rogue; after he hung on the gallows, I had the curiosity to take off his cap, and saw, as I before heard, that he was cropt. — Such work as he and his fellow prisoners made the day before they were executed was never known here before; they got off their bolts in the night, and made their escape out of goal, but were soon apprehended, and their irons renew'd, the next morning (when they were to have been executed) they had them off again, barr'd the room they were confined in, bid defiance to the Sheriff and his party and were determined to kill any person that should attempt to take them out; the militia of the whole city was obliged to be got under arms. <persName>Wall</persName> and his two fellows kept them off, and none dare go in, as they were to die at any rate. <persName>Wall</persName> sat fire to the goal, and expected to die so; but the inhabitants soon brought the engines and extinguished it. — His next contrivance was thus; he got about two pounds of powder from some malicious fellows, put it in a bottle, and a match to put to it when the Sheriff or any other person dare venture in: Thus they kept the city in an uproar for some time; at last a party suddenly broke in upon them, and according to his scheme, fix'd his match to the bottle, which he held in his hand, but thro' the mercy of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224151">providence</placeName>, the powder did not take fire. — After which they were carried to the gallows, and executed according to their desert. <persName>Wall</persName> seem'd to die penitent, and sung psalms at the place of execution.<ref target="#CH13-n35">

               <persName>Belcher</persName>'s dying speech, if sincere, indicated penitence. He stated that he was a New Englander of good family and a silversmith by trade, always "of an unsocial, refractory disposition." About seven
<pb n="169"/>
years earlier he had gone to reside in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4938157">Great Barrington</placeName>, where he met with people as perversely inclined as himself. He soon became associated with them and concerted schemes which had no tendency to promote the interests of their neighbors. "No gain," he said, "afforded me so much pleasure as that which I acquired by illicit means. Coining and counterfeiting engrossed my attention, and those who first advised me to transgress, persuaded me to continue my inquitous practices." He added bitterly that those more guilty than he had escaped the danger through the mediation of friends or the powerful efficacy of a sum of money, properly applied.<ref target="#CH13-n36">

               <persName corresp="#viaf_18700040">Joseph Bill Packer</persName>, of whose life and travels a cursory narrative had been already published, in his speech and confession touched thus upon his counterfeiting operations:
<q>I never considered that it was criminal for a mechanic to finish any piece of work that he is employed to execute, whatever mischievous purposes the instrument he makes is applied to, after the artist delivers it out of his hands: For example a gun-smith makes a musket, an assassin purchases it, and with it shoots twenty men, whose lives were very valuable to society, is the innocent mechanic to be made answerable for the damage done by the villain?</q>
               <q>My case is exactly similar; I engraved plates in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4482348">North-Carolina</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and the Jersies, for people who made a practice of counterfeiting the currency of those provinces; but I never passed any bills of credit fabricated by them.</q>
               <q>In the months of March and February last I was applied to, by <persName>William Hulbert</persName> and <persName>Daniel Lewis</persName>, to engrave two copper plates, the one to resemble a three pounds, and the other a five shillings bill, dated February 16, 1771, of the late emission of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> bills of credit; I compleated the work, and received a reward of eighteen pounds when I delivered the plate to <persName>Hulbert</persName> and <persName>Lewis</persName>.</q>
               <q>Afterwards I saw <persName>Hulbert</persName> strike, or impress, about forty bills on the same copper-plates that I had engraved.</q>
               <q>
                  <persName>Daniel Lewis</persName> signed the bills, and his sister (<persName>Miss Polly</persName>, an active, accomplished young lady) distributed the ink upon the plates when the
<pb n="170"/>
impression was struck. <persName>James Budd</persName> was in the room when the work was performed, and <persName>Deacon Kelleck</persName> came to <persName>Lewis</persName>'s house with a watch, in order to exchange it for bills of their manufacture. And, in my opinion, the father of <persName>Daniel Lewis</persName> was not ignorant of the illegal transactions of his son and associates.<ref target="#CH13-n37">

               <persName>John Wall Lovely</persName>, in his dying speech, told of his youth in <placeName>Hampshire</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, his residence on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2646007">Isle of Wight</placeName>, his travels to <placeName corresp="#geonames_9062329">Newfoundland</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName>, and his coming to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName>. After also relating his marriage, which ended in a divorce, he closed his discourse with this story of the counterfeiters:
<q>In the year 1772, I sold a watch for between seven and eight Pounds; the man who bought her gave me an order for the money upon <persName>John Smith</persName>, after receiving the money I passed a thirty shilling bill at <placeName>Reading</placeName>; it was found to be counterfeited, and I was committed to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4834157">Fairfield</placeName> goal. I was urged to discover my associates, but I had none; nor had I any acquaintance of <persName>Smith</persName> before that time. — An intimate acquaintance has since taken advantage of my ignorance and occasioned my overthrow. I sold a horse to him for six pounds, he paid me in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> money which he said was good. Soon after I met with one <persName>Asa Holmes</persName>, at <placeName>Pittsfield</placeName>. I bought a watch from him and gave him two Bills that I received for the horse. The next week he followed me to <placeName>Sheffield</placeName>, but not finding me there, he came to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4938157">Great-Barrington</placeName>, where he apprehended me at the house of one <persName>Haycock</persName>, I settled with him upon his own exorbitant terms, gave him back his watch, and also to make him quiet, I gave him a horse that was estimated at fifty dollars besides a saddle and bridle. When he got from me what he could, him and his vile gang brought me over to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> government. I was examined before 'Squires <persName>Whiting</persName> and <persName>Adgate</persName>. I told them, that I had the bills of <persName>Lewis Benedict Bennet</persName>, and that I could prove it by evidences that were present when I received them; the justices said that I was connected with the Money-makers, and that if I would discover them I should be admitted an evidence and not sent to goal; I told them, that by misfortune I had passed a bad thirty shillings Bill before and was punished for it at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4834157">Fairfield</placeName>: 'Squire <persName>Whiting</persName> said that was nothing, desired me to tell all I knew, &amp; if I was not cleared he should be hanged.</q>
               <pb n="171"/>

            <p>The General Assembly of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> was disturbed by the discovery that so many counterfeits of its latest emission had been struck off. On March 8, 1773, a law was passed entitled "An Act to remedy the Evil this Colony is exposed to from the great Quantities of counterfeit Money introduced into it." The first two paragraphs of this act give the general situation and the remedy prescribed to cure it. They read thus:
<q>WHEREAS the Credit of the paper Currency of this Colony hath been of late greatly injured by the flagitious Practices of artful and wicked Men who have counterfeited and altered the same, and passed such counterfeited and altered Bills knowing the same to be counterfeited and altered: And as it is of the utmost importance to the trade and Interest of the Colony to prevent the Mischiefs arising from the Circulation of counterfeit Currency; and as it may tend greatly to defeat the Designs of the Counterfeiters if the true and genuine Bills be distinguished from such as are false and Counterfeited...</q>
               <q>BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by his Excellency the Governor the Council and the General Assembly, and it is hereby enacted by the Authority of the same That the Treasurer of this Colony for the Time being, <persName>Samuel Verplank</persName>, <persName>Teophilact Bache</persName>, and <persName>Walter Franklin</persName> and the major Part of them are hereby constituted Commissioners, and authorized to cause such plate or plates, and Device or Devices to be formed and engraved as they shall judge to be most difficult to be immitated and counterfeited as they or the major Part of them may think proper; and forty four thousand Copies thereof to be struck off upon thin paper to be pasted, glued or affixed to each of the Bills emitted by the Act [that of February, 1771] aforesaid.<ref target="#CH13-n43">

               <hi rend="bold">P</hi>robably the most resolute and also the most skillful counterfeiter of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> currency during the entire Colonial Period was <persName>Samuel Ford</persName>. Through confessions made in 1773 by his accomplices it was revealed that <persName>Ford</persName> had been in the business of money making for many years and that "in the year 1767, or 8, he followed it in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>; but was apprehended on suspicion of making money, and admitted to bail, and even then set about preparing materials to renew the business..."<ref target="#CH14-n1">

            </p>
            <p>At some time prior to April 18, 1769, <persName>Ford</persName> was arrested, for on that day he appeared under recognizance before the Supreme Court meeting at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_halle">City Hall</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, at which time his case was respited to the 21, then the 22, the 24, the 27, the 28 and finally the 29, when he appeared "and Proclamation being three times made and no Person appearing to prosecute, On Motion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <persName>Kissam</persName> Ordered that the Defendant be discharged from his Recognizance."<ref target="#CH14-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Thus the authorities, probably because of lack of sufficient evidence, allowed a most accomplished criminal to slip through their fingers and ply his business of counterfeiting unmolested for several years to come.</p>
            <p>After his trouble with the law in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>
               <persName>Ford</persName> removed to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5098810">Hanover</placeName>, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>. The first hint of further difficulty for him and his associates was an advertisement placed in <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Rivington</persName>'s <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazetteer</hi> of June 10, 1773, by <persName>Samuel Haines</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_morristown_new_jersey">Morristown</placeName>. It read as follows:
<q>Twenty Pounds Reward. Whereas on Friday or Saturday the 28th or 29th of May, came to my house at <placeName>Morris Town</placeName>, a man of middle size, aged between 25 and 30 years, of a lively countenance, and streight hair:
<pb n="175"/>
Had on a brown coat, striped jacket, white breches and stocking, rode a dark bay horse, says his name is <persName>Reddon</persName>, or <persName>Redmon</persName>, and that he came from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, with whom I chang'd a Ten Pound York bill (of the latest emission of that currency) for twenty-five dollars; the bill was marked on the back H. in one of the corners. The dollars since prove to be counterfeit, of which he had many more with him, and it is supposed will offer them to change for paper money. He enquired the road to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4835128">Goshen</placeName> and it is likely is gone that way. If any person or persons will apprehend and secure him in any of his Majesty's goals, so that he may be brought to condign punishment, shall receive the above reward of Twenty Pounds, by me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>As <persName>Samuel Haines</persName> was involved with <persName>Ford</persName> in counterfeiting, it would almost seem that by his advertisement <persName>Haines</persName> was attempting to avert suspicion from himself.</p>
            <p>In any event the same newspaper, on July 22, 1773, printed this item:
<q>On Friday last was apprehended at his house at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5098810">Hanover</placeName>, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris county</placeName>, the well known <persName>Samuel Ford</persName>, who had been long suspected of counterfeiting the paper currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName>, with which he was accustomed to travel into <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName>, and other provinces, and has for several years passed the same to a very large amount, as the lawful emission of the <placeName>Jersey</placeName> Treasury. He went to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> six years, and to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> eighteen months ago, some time after the last emission of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> currency, no doubt with views of procuring dies, stamps, paper and prints, to imitate the true bills in the most plausible manner, and to carry on this pernicious practice of plundering the public. He broke gaol on Saturday night being aided in his escape by one <persName>John King</persName>, a veteran in villainy and a confederate with him in this species of it. The Sheriff, at his wit's end, on occasion of this unfortunate incident has raised an hue and cry, published a description of their persons, and offered a reward of 50 l. for apprehending <persName>Ford</persName>, and 25 l. for the person of King, which, with many other particulars, will be inserted in this next week's Gazetteer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The advertisement, which all printers were requested, as it was "a Matter of very publick Consequence," to place in their newspapers, was dated "<placeName>Morris-Town</placeName>, 18th July, 1773," and couched in these terms:
<q>FIFTY POUNDS REWARD. Broke from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName> Gaol, the noted <persName>SAMUEL FORD</persName>, accused of, and committed to Gaol for counter-

feiting <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName> Paper Currency. He is a well built Fellow, about thirty Years of Age, five Feet ten Inches high; had on when he went away, a Nankeen Waistcoat and Breeches, a brown Coat, plain brown Thread Stockings, a good pair of Shoes, and silver twisted Buckles: It is supposed he has taken with him a suit of pale sky coloured blue Clothes, with a large silver Twist gay Button, he has short brown curled Hair, very red Cheeks, and a remarkable Dimple in his Chin. He is an artful Fellow, — with the Serious and Grave, can put on the Face of Seriousness, Religion, and Gravity, and with the Gay, can behave with as much Levity as any one. In the Year 1768, he was committed to the Gaol in the City of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> on Suspicion of counterfeiting <placeName>Jersey</placeName> Paper Currency: — Since which, in the Year 1771, he has been in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, from whence he returned in 1772 to <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q20999000">Hallifax</placeName>, from thence to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName>, and so on to this Place: And from that Time to the Day of apprehending him he lived in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, and made frequent Excursions to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>, upon the Business (it is supposed) of exchanging Counterfeit Money. It is suspected that one <persName>JOHN KING</persName>, late of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName>, a square well set Fellow, about five Feet eight or nine Inches high, with short brown coloured straight Hair, full Face, and rather dark Complexion; also accused of making and counterfeiting Money; is in Company with said <persName>Ford</persName>, as he absconded at the same Time, and gave <persName>Ford</persName> Assistance in making his Escape. the said <persName>JOHN KING</persName> has been frequently within a few Years past, at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q5470761">Fort Augusta</placeName>, and in the Year 1770 and 1771, was at <placeName>Wioming</placeName>, and served under the Government of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, against the <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New-England</placeName> People. Whoever takes said <persName>Ford</persName> and secures him in any of his Majesty's Gaols, so that he may be had again, shall receive the above Sum of Fifty Pounds, and all reasonable Charges: And whoever takes said <persName>KING</persName>, and brings him to me, or to the Gaoler of said <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">County of Morris</placeName>, shall receive a Reward of twenty-five Pounds, and all reasonable Charges.

Also a <persName>Captain Joseph Richardson</persName> was informed against for counterfeiting but after his arrest he escaped from the officer who had taken him. He was described as a middle aged man, six feet one or two inches high, of fair complexion and light brown hair, a well made, stout, active man. Further, a reward of £500 was offered for the discovery of the author of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> counterfeits.<ref target="#CH14-n5">

            <p>A letter, dated <placeName>Morris-Town</placeName>, Aug. 30, 1773, and sent to <persName>James Rivington</persName>, gave the results of a special Court of Oyer and Terminer held there for the discovery and trial of the persons concerned in counterfeiting the paper currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>.

<q>This account you would have had sooner, but it was thought (for certain reasons) prudent not to publish it until this time.</q>
               <q>You have already mentioned in your paper that <persName>Samuel Ford</persName> and <persName>John King</persName> had escaped from goal. Their escape made it extreemly difficult to discover their accomplices. The Court opened on Tuesday the 11th, and it was the Friday following before the least intimation could be got of any person concerned, when one of them, who lay under the <hi rend="italic">censure</hi> of three convictions, the one for aiding <persName>Ford</persName> and King in their escape, and the others for high misdemeanors, on being hard pushed, and in order to mitigate his punishment for these crimes, began to make a confession, this soon alarmed another of the accomplices, who made an ample and full confession.</q>
               <q>By which confessions, and those of the persons afterwards apprehended, these facts appeared — That <persName>Ford</persName> had been in the business of money making many years, that in the year 1767, or 8, he followed it in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>; but was apprehended on a suspicion of making money, and admitted

to bail, and even then set about preparing materials to renew the business, that he soon removed back into this county, where he again entered into it, and made a connection in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, with a certain <persName>Captain Joseph Richardson</persName>, from whom he got a supply of types, he then attempted the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> emission of Three Pound Bills, and made a considerable sum, but complained of the thinness of the paper, and the bad credit of the currency; at least in this and the neighbouring provinces, and gave a preference to the <placeName>Jersey</placeName> currency; but it is thought did little at it till the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> emission of 1769 came out, when he with <persName>Captain Richardson</persName> went to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, and from thence to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> and the manufactoring towns, and <persName>Ford</persName> applied himself to learn the business of an engraver and type maker, and from his knowledge before in the art of carving, and an uncommon natural genius, he in the course of three months became so perfect a master of the business, that (on his return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>) he made all the types for his press, and in so masterly a manner, that the imitation of the <placeName>Jersey</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> bills, which were struck by them of Three Pounds, and Thirty Shillings is so exact that the difference cannot be discovered without the most strict examination of a person well acquainted with the true bills.</q>
               <q>From the time of his return, till he was apprehended, he went on with uninterrupted success, and emitted large sums of the <placeName>Jersey</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> currency; but principally of the latter, for these two years past, and was the less apprehensive of being detected for the following reasons:</q>
               <q>1st. His bills had stood the test of several treasurers examination, and had had their sanction, which he ever made an invariable rule to secure before he passed any of his new emissions.</q>
               <q>2dly. His press and all his implements were in an almost impenetrable swamp, at a mile distance from his house, and in which the water, most part of the year, was half leg deep, so that no person could track him, and he must <hi rend="italic">crawl</hi> on his belly some rods before he could reach it.</q>
               <q>3dly. As no person, except King and <persName>Richardson</persName>, knew where he did work, or had ever seen the place, and these, and all others concerned, were sworn to secrecy. — He used to go to his work at day light, in the morning, with his gun, so that no person could suspect him. <persName>Ford</persName> was called the <hi rend="italic">Treasurer for the three provinces</hi>. He signed his own bills. By direction of the Court a number of persons went into the swamp, in search of his types, &amp;c. but found only his press, and a leather that covered the bills when they
<pb n="179"/>
were struck, on which was the impression of a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Bill of £3, of the emission of 1769.</q>
               <q>Upon these facts the following persons (who were only concerned as passers of the money, except <persName>Reynolds</persName>, who procured some types for <persName>Ford</persName>) to wit, <persName>Benjamin Cooper</persName>, Esq; <persName>Doctor Bern Budd</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_29879814">Samuel Haynes</persName> and <persName>David Reynolds</persName>, were indicted and plead guilty to their several indictments, and on the nineteenth they received sentence of death, to be executed the 17th of September next. Few scenes ever were more truly affecting than the one in the court-house, at the time of sentence passing. — These four persons are remarkably handsome fine looking men, three of them about thirty, the other 40, they are all married and have children. All are descendants from the first families in the province, and all have parents living, and numerous relations — the attendance of their relations and friends added much to the solemnity of it, so much that it is better conceived than described — among a thousand people there was scarce a dry eye. The spectators were more sensible affected for those unhappy persons, as it appeared they had been drawn into it by the art, cunning and perswasion of that VILLAIN FORD.</q>
               <q>These were all the persons apprehended for capital crimes, except justice <persName>Ayres</persName>, whose crime was committed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5105168">Sussex county</placeName>, it appeared he had not been in the practice for some time past, and if any judgement can be formed of his repentance, by his conduct and carriage, it was sincere before he was suspected, as his life had lately been so exemplary, that the congregation to which he belonged had promoted him to the rank of deacon, and the parson was so fully convinced of his innocence, that on the Sunday after his committment he PRAYED for his protection from <hi rend="italic">false accusers</hi>, and the Sunday following a report prevailed that he was released, when the Parson returned thanks for it; but alas! before the next Sunday certain accounts were received that he had confessed his crime.</q>
               <q>During these enquiries, sufficient evidence appeared to convince every one present, that <persName>Ford</persName> was one of the Persons that robbed the Treasury of this Province some years since, both, from his own confession to one of the convicts, who declared it on oath, as also from many other circumstance.</q>
               <q>From this account of <persName>Ford</persName>, the Public must view him in the light of the most accomplished <hi rend="italic">Villain</hi>, that this country ever produced, and it is hoped it will stimulate every well-wisher to the community throughout the continent, to be watchfull for, and active in apprehending him, especially
<pb n="180"/>
when they have the promise of 500 l. from the Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, for convicting the Person who counterfeited the Currency of that Province, and of his being the man, against whom there is the fullest Proof. — It is supposed he is gone to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</placeName>, and intends going down to the mouth of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1497">Mississippi</placeName>, <persName>Richardson</persName> has also made his escape.</q>
               <q>The Grand Jury in a polite Address, thanked the Court and Attorney General for the great Pains they had taken, in aiding them in their discoveries, and in a very particular manner gave their thanks; and those of the County to some Persons, whose activity had laid a foundation for detecting and breaking up this nest of public robbers.</q>
               <q>You should have had this at large with the answer to it, but too much of your Paper would be taken up thereby, for one subject to ingross.</q>
               <q>Thus Sir, I have given you a brief account of the facts that appeared to the Court, so far as they relate to the Paper Currency...<ref target="#CH14-n6">

            <p>The pursuit of <persName>Ford</persName> occupied considerable space in the newspapers for some time. On September 9, 1773, <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Rivington</persName>'s <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazetteer</hi> reported: "By a letter from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName>, dated the 6th instant, we have certain intelligence that <persName>Ford</persName> the money-maker, was a few days past on the West branch of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q27538">Susquehanna</placeName>, where a number of persons, from all quarters are gone in pursuit of him, so that the much injured public may now expect this most dangerous man will be apprehended, and exemplarily punished, a circumstance most ardently wished, as it may possibly lead to an extension of mercy in favour of several persons who have been unhappily, through his immediate means brought into the most shocking and desperate circumstances."</p>
            <p>New light on the affair was shed by the following account published a week later in the same newspaper:
<q>On the 3d instant a further and very strict search was made for printing materials (concealed by <persName>Ford</persName>, the money maker) in the swamp where the press was found, when, after much diligence exerted, a set of plates for printing the currencies of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New-Jersey</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>, with a quantity of types and other utensils for carrying on the
<pb n="181"/>
counterfeiting bills of each province, were discovered and secured. In the course of his flight he put off some <placeName>Jersey</placeName> bills of his own manufacture amongst the Indians, who being afterwards apprized that they were counterfeited, very chearfully joined in the pursuit of this most pernicious artist.</q>
               <q>Positive accounts are received that <persName>Ford</persName> and King were at <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q5470761">Fort Augusta</placeName>, near <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q27538">Susquehannah</placeName>, on the 29th of August, he was hovering in a canoe on one of the branches of that river, so he is not very likely to escape.</q>
               <q>We are just now informed that <persName>Ford</persName> and King were on the 5th instant at a village called <placeName>Annaquauga</placeName>, and the chasseurs expected to be up with them the next night.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next number of <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Rivington</persName>'s <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazetteer</hi>, on September 23, devoted space to the latest developments:
<q>Last Friday between ten and twelve o'clock, was executed at <placeName>Morris Town</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q845760">East-Jersey</placeName>, <persName>David Reynolds</persName>, who was convicted of counterfeiting and passing of base money; he died very penitent. <persName>Cooper</persName>
                  <persName>Budd</persName> and <persName>Haines</persName>, condemned with him, are respited to the 15th of October. The public shall shortly be made acquainted with many interesting and authentic particulars relative to this dangerous confederacy. The last accounts of <persName>Ford</persName>, the most heinous of this destructive community, are, that he was seen asleep under a tree, guarded by King, and another man well armed; they take their rest alternately in this manner. <persName>Ford</persName> is reduced by a fever, joined to a complication of the most loathsome distempers, which prevent his travelling now any more than five miles a day, and as there are some very determined people engaged in the pursuit, it is expected he is ere now either found dead or taken alive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reason for the respiting of <persName>Cooper</persName>, <persName>Budd</persName> and <persName>Haines</persName> is probably found in this extract from a letter from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5102578">Perth Amboy</placeName>, dated September 15 and printed in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Journal; or, the General Advertiser</hi> of September 23, 1773: "The Wives and Relations of most of the unhappy Money Makers, now under Sentence of Death, are here with the Governor, in Order to solicit him for a Reprieve.

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette; and the Weekly Mercury</hi> of September 27, 1773, thus recounted the story of <persName>Reynold</persName>'s death and the respiting of the others:
<q>On Friday the 17th Instant at <placeName>Morris Town</placeName> in <placeName>East New Jersey</placeName>, was executed, <persName>David Reynolds</persName>, a Native of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>, about 32 years of age, for counterfeiting the money Bills of Credit of that Colony. He arrived there about ten Years ago, and chiefly followed the farming business till getting acquainted with one <persName>Rosecrans</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH14-n7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref> (executed some time ago for the like Crime, but without declaring his Accomplices) he was by him led into the Scheme of making and passing counterfeit Money; after the Execution of <persName>Rosecrans</persName>, <persName>Reynolds</persName> accidentally met with <persName>Capt. Richardson</persName> (of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName>, who is fled) and getting acquainted with each other's Characters, was by him introduced to <persName>Ford</persName>, <persName>Haynes</persName>, <persName>Cooper</persName>, <persName>Budd</persName>, King, and the rest of the Gang. <persName>Ford</persName> the Principal, termed by the Rest, the Treasurer of the three Provinces, had counterfeited the Money Bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, in so Masterly a manner as not to be distinguished from the true Bills without the nicest Inspection, and also several of the Gold and Silver Coins current in the British Colonies; and in passing these, <persName>Reynolds</persName> and the Rest of the Accomplices continued, till <persName>Ford</persName> and King were apprehended and imprisoned in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris County</placeName> Gaol, from whence they soon after made their escape, as mentioned in the Papers. One of the Gang being convicted of aiding them in their Escape and other high Misdemeanors, to mitigate his Punishment, made some Confessions tending to the Discovery of the Rest, which alarmed another, who made an ample confession of the whole, in Consequence of which <persName>Reynolds</persName>, <persName>Haynes</persName>, <persName>Cooper</persName>, and <persName>Budd</persName>, were tried, confessed their Guilt, and were condemned to be hanged. Their Execution was ordered to be on the 17th Instant; before the <persName>Time</persName>, <persName>Budd</persName> and <persName>Haynes</persName> were respited for a Month, but <persName>Reynolds</persName> and <persName>Cooper</persName> were ordered to prepare for Execution at the Time appointed. A few Minutes before the Time, <persName>Cooper</persName> confessed himself privy to the Robbery of the Treasury at <placeName>Amboy</placeName>, and that he received
<pb n="183"/>
Three Hundred Pounds of the Money; on which he also was respited till he should make further Discoveries. <persName>Reynolds</persName> was therefore ordered for Execution alone...</q>
               <q>
                  <persName>Cooper</persName> confessed that he was privy to the robbery of the Treasury at <placeName>Amboy</placeName>, and received 300 l. of the Money, that it was concerted by <persName>Ford</persName> and perpetrated by him and three Soldiers then quartered there; that the plan was, first to attempt to carry off the Iron Chest, if that fail'd, next to take the <persName>Key</persName> from <persName>Mr. Skinner</persName>'s Bedroom, and to kill him or any Person who should discover them; and that if afterwards any of them should be suspected and convicted, they were to turn King's Evidence and accuse <persName>Mr. Skinner</persName> as being the only Accomplice with them. When some of them were shocked at this Proposal as thereby an innocent Person might lose his Life; <persName>Ford</persName> replied, <hi rend="italic">no, damn him, he will only be condemned, he has Friends enough to save him from the Gallows</hi>. That after breaking into the Treasurer's Office adjoining to his Bed Room, they attempted to carry off the Chest, but finding it difficult, set it down again, and breaking open a Desk in the Room, in hopes to find Money, they therein found an old <persName>Key</persName> to the Money Chest, which was rusty and thought unfit for Use (the <persName>Key</persName> then used being in <persName>Mr. Skinner</persName>'s Bed Room) with this old <persName>Key</persName>, they opened the Iron Chest, and thereby the Lives that would been exposed by their Search for the other <persName>Key</persName>, were probably preservd'.

<q>A letter from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5197085">Lancaster county</placeName> to a gentleman in this town says, "The famous <persName>Richardson</persName>, who has long been in a fair, or rather foul way of making money, after taking leave of his wife and family, who lived in the <placeName>Great Valley</placeName>, lodged, the night before he took flight towards the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</placeName>, at <persName>Mr. M......s</persName>; during his stay there, which was about nine hours, he discovered symptoms of a mind rather warily than fearfully agitated, and seemed resolvedly fixed to defend the most desperate attack on his person. He was well armed, as was also a man that attended him, who, soon as day dawned, took his station before the house, watching narrowly every person who passed, until they departed. On <persName>Richardson</persName>'s going off, being asked if he was not afraid of being taken, he replied, 'no; damn me! A man whose pockets are lined with money, and his heart with courage, has nothing to fear but God; and before I am heard of again in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName>, I shall be out of the reach of pursuit.'"</q>

<pb n="186"/>
               <q>A Discovery was made some time in the beginning of the last summer of a number of persons in the counties of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101160">Middlesex</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101305">Monmouth</placeName>, concerned in making a base kind of Half Johannes, and Spanish Dollars, which happily led to the discovery of another gang of villains in the counties of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101405">Morris</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5105168">Sussex</placeName>, who had for several years past been employed in counterfeiting and passing the paper currency of this and the neighbouring colonies. From the confessions of some of them, corroborated by many striking circumstances, the affair of the robbery of the treasury, which had remained so long enveloped in darkness, has likewise been brought to light. Unluckily some of each gang have made their escape out of the province; but all of the former who were apprehended, and one of the chief of the latter have received that punishment for their crimes which the law would permit; three others, who were sentenced to death, have been respited, for very particular reasons, as you will see by the papers I shall order to be laid before you. No endeavours have been, or shall be wanting on my part, to have those who escaped, apprehended and brought to justice.</q>
               <q>As the Mischief in which these persons were engaged is of such extensive and pernicious a nature, I cannot but congratulate you upon the stop which has been put to its further progress: Nor can I doubt but you will think with me, that the thanks and grateful acknowledgements of the public are due to those Gentlemen who have with great zeal and abilities, and with considerable trouble and expence, been the means of detecting and apprehending the authors of it.</q>
               <q>On this occasion I think it proper to recommend to you the passing of a <persName>Law</persName> to make it a felony to counterfeit in this province the silver and gold coin of foreign countries. Many of them have now so general a circulation here, that the mischiefs resulting from their being counterfeited may be as destructive as the counterfeiting of our own paper currency.<ref target="#CH14-n12">

            <p>The same newspaper on January 20, 1774, was still hopeful that <persName>Ford</persName> and King would be taken.

On January 21, 1773, a certain <persName>John Pell</persName> of <placeName>North Barrington</placeName> was indicted for passing a counterfeit five shilling bill, probably to one <persName>Edward Welsh</persName>. He was arraigned in the Supreme Court and entered a plea of not guilty. On the next day he was tried, with <persName>Edward Welsh</persName>, <persName>Jasper Ruckle</persName> and <persName>Alderman George Brewerton</persName> as witnesses for the King, and <persName>Samuel Avery</persName> and <persName>Samuel Stevens</persName> as witnesses for the prisoner.

               </ref> It may be noted that almost twenty years earlier <persName>Pell</persName> had been in trouble with the law, for Attorney <persName>General Kempe</persName> had filed an information for breach of the peace and assault against <persName>John Pell</persName> of <placeName>Eastchester</placeName> in the County of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144050">Westchester</placeName>, yeoman. He was described therein as "being a disorderly Person and Common Disturber of the Peace." It was specifically charged that in the house of one <persName>Caleb Morgan</persName> he assaulted <persName>Morgan</persName>'s wife, <persName>Abigail</persName>, threatened to kill her, and called her "a damned Negro bitch." When he was ejected from the place, he broke in again, threw part of the door into the street, and also broke open the door of an inner room.<ref target="#CH15-n2">

            <p>That there was a knot of money makers or passers of counterfeits in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144050">Westchester County</placeName> is shown by a petition presented to the governor and his council by the judges and some of the justices and freeholders of that county. They stated that there were in the county jail three persons, <persName>Zephaniah Hubbs</persName>, <persName>Abraham Miller, Jr.</persName>, and <persName>Thomas Smith</persName>, charged with passing counterfeit money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. These men had
<pb n="189"/>
families dependent on their labor for their support. If they were kept in jail until the regular time for holding court, it would bring great loss to the families and cause much trouble to the jailer and others, especially since an attempt had been made by persons without to break open the jail. The petitioners requested, therefore, that a special Commission of Oyer and Terminer issue for that county, and the council at its meeting on April 12, 1773, so advised and the governor gave the necessary order.<ref target="#CH15-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            </p>
            <p>At some time between April 12 and April 28 a second attempt from without on the jail of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144050">Westchester County</placeName> was attended with success, and <persName>Hubbs</persName>, and presumably other prisoners, escaped. At a council meeting on April 28 the governor communicated two papers which he had received from <persName>Justice Ludlow</persName> but which had been written by <persName>Elizabeth Hubbs</persName>, the wife of <persName>Zephaniah</persName>, to <persName>Abraham Hatfield</persName>, a justice of the peace of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144050">Westchester County</placeName>. In them she signified that her husband was willing to reveal the identity of those persons who broke open the jail if he could be safe in so doing. The governor was advised to signify to <persName>Hubbs</persName> that he would be granted the King's pardon if within fourteen days he surrendered himself in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> to one of the judges of the Supreme Court and "discover every thing he knows concerning the breaking the said Goal and Counterfeiting and passing Counterfeit Money, and the Persons by whom either of the said Offences have been perpetrated."<ref target="#CH15-n4">

            <p>
               <persName>Hubbs</persName>, however, was evidently not anxious to walk straight into the hands of the law, for instead of surrendering himself he wrote to Chief <persName>Justice Horsmanden</persName> and informed him that, if he could obtain a pardon, he was able to reveal the names of the persons who aided the prisoners in breaking jail at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144336">White Plains</placeName>. <persName corresp="#viaf_15202764">Horsmanden</persName> sent the letter to the governor, who on July 7, 1773, was advised by his council to issue a pardon to <persName>Hubbs</persName> "on his appearing before the Board to make Confession upon Oath of the Contents of the said Letter."<ref target="#CH15-n5">

Doubtless arrests were made as a result of <persName>Hubbs</persName>' evidence and the persons apprehended were probably to be tried by a Court of Oyer and Terminer early in September, but this court was determined because three of the justices inadvertently left the bench and a new Commission was then ordered.<ref target="#CH15-n6">

            <p>In August, 1773, according to the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Gazette</hi> of September 8, a girl of about twelve years of age was detected passing counterfeit dollars in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224151">Providence</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode Island</placeName>. Her father was immediately arrested and committed to jail. In his pocketbook, which he found means to hide while in the custody of the officer, was found a counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bill. The false dollars were badly done and were dated 1770. Apparently the man was not operating alone, for the authorities promptly took up another person, and further arrests were expected.</p>
            <p>Early in December, 1773, a member of another gang was apprehended in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, a certain <persName>Thomas Williams</persName>. He was examined by <persName>Alderman Brewerton</persName>, to whom he confessed that he was concerned with a gang of money makers in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName>, where, for this crime, he had been branded in the forehead and cropped. He was committed to Bridewell by the alderman. In the newspaper accounts <persName>Williams</persName> was described thus: "He is about 25 Years old, pitted with the Small Pox, and appears to be smart and sensible."<ref target="#CH15-n7">

            <p>The story of this affair is found in great detail in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Provincial Congress</hi> I for the months from May to October. On May 10, 1776, <persName>Jacob Sharpe</persName> produced in the provincial congress a letter from one <persName>Charles Friend</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144040">Westbury</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5133268">Queens County</placeName>. <persName>Friend</persName> wrote that he believed that Continental money was being counterfeited on <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125123">Long Island</placeName>. As a result of this communication a safe conduct was given to <persName>Friend</persName>, who presented himself and gave his testimony. He had heard at <placeName corresp="#geonames_5113196">Cold Spring</placeName> from a certain <persName>John Anderson</persName> that <persName>Henry Dawkins</persName> was living at the home of <placeName>Israel</placeName> and <persName>Isaac Young</persName>, where the three were making money, and that <persName>Isaac Ketcham</persName> was probably concerned with them.</p>
            <pb n="194"/>
            <p>On the evening of May 11 Captain <persName>Jeremiah Wool</persName> crossed the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5116041">East River</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125123">Long Island</placeName>, proceeded to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5121636">Huntington</placeName>, where he was joined by <persName>Thomas Weeks</persName>. They arrived at the house of <persName>Isaac Young</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5113196">Cold Spring</placeName> at 2 A.M. on Sunday and there they found <persName>Isaac</persName> at home. A search revealed a secret door and a stairway which led to a garret, in which were discovered a printing press, an imperfect copy of a <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> bill of twenty shillings and several unfinished counterfeits. Everything was put in a wagon and taken to <persName>Williams' Tavern</persName>, whence men were dispatched who brought in <persName>Dawkins</persName> and a certain <persName>John Henderson</persName>. <persName>Dawkins</persName> made a statement involving the Young brothers, <persName>Townsend Hulet</persName> and <persName>Isaac Ketcham</persName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dawkins</persName>, who had been born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and apprenticed to an engraver in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName>, came to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> after 1750, and for some offence found himself in the jail of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>, probably early in 1776. Israel Young visited him there, offered to get him out of prison, and lent him money with which to pay the rent for his shop. Upon his release <persName>Dawkins</persName> went with his small son to live at the home of the Youngs in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5113196">Cold Spring</placeName>, where he was to print money. The Youngs secured from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> a bookbinder's press but, as this would not serve the purpose, <persName>Dawkins</persName> rubbed off a few <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> bills with a burnisher and one of the Youngs signed them.</p>
            <p>At length a suitable rolling press was brought from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> and bills were run off. <persName corresp="#viaf_26026336">Hugh Gaine</persName>, publisher of the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi>: <hi rend="italic">and the Weekly Mercury</hi>, had secured one of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> bills which had been rubbed off and printed a description of the counterfeits and pointed out how they differed from the true bills. From this newspaper item <persName>Dawkins</persName> made suitable changes in his plate, especially causing the two small crosses after the asterisk and before the obelisk to join together.</p>
            <p>It was revealed that the Youngs had consulted the Tory printer, <persName>James Rivington</persName>, that they had found it difficult to obtain the type of paper needed, and had sent first <persName>Levi Lott</persName> and later <persName>Isaac Ketcham</persName> to try to secure some. Neither agent, however, had any success. <persName>Ketcham</persName> testified that <persName>Dawkins</persName> and the Youngs had figured that the
<pb n="195"/>
Tories would counterfeit money anyway, so that they might as well do it too. It appeared that <persName>Dawkins</persName> had previously cut some plates for the Continental Congress.</p>
            <p>After being imprisoned in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_halle">City Hall</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, the Youngs were sent off to prison in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q754815">Litchfield</placeName>, and <persName>Dawkins</persName> was jailed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144336">White Plains</placeName>, where conditions were so bad that on October 19 he petitioned the Provincial Congress for the death penalty. Eventually, however, he was released, for by the spring of 1778 he was free and making the first engraving for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> State Coat of Arms.<ref target="#CH15-n21">
                  <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
               </ref> The fate of the Youngs is not known. <persName>Isaac Ketcham</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5121636">Huntington</placeName> had been involved in counterfeiting years before and had fled from the constables. Apparently he later made his peace with the authorities. On the present occasion, after spending some time in jail, he probably was released.</p>
            <p>In June two Continental soldiers, <persName>Michael Lynch</persName> and <persName>Thomas Hickey</persName>, were confined in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_halle">City Hall</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> for trying to pass a counterfeit Continental bill and also the back part of a real bill of credit. The provincial congress decided that they could be tried only by court martial, so they were sent off with the evidence against them to <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">General Washington</persName>.<ref target="#CH15-n22">

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi rend="bold">I</hi>nvestigators of social and economic history will find in this study evidence of the wide scope of counterfeiting and its impact on the economy of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> and other provinces. Clipping, counterfeiting, and passing of bad money appeared in the seventeenth century and grew steadily in extent and harmfulness, so that before the Revolution highly organized gangs were working in cooperation throughout the British colonies. It was estimated in 1768 that there was a clan of five hundred counterfeiters in the colonies from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5090174">New Hampshire</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4482348">North Carolina</placeName>. In the light of subsequent revelations the number seems to have been too small. Early in 1773 at a Court of Oyer and Terminer held in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106834">Albany</placeName> no less than thirty six indictments were found against counterfeiters and passers, and within a few months other offenders were arrested in various parts of the province.</p>
            <p>The exact amount of bogus money put into circulation cannot be determined but the evidence proves that it was very large. False bills amounting to more than £707 are recorded as burned by order of the court of Quarter Sessions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> between the years 1720 and 1766, not counting £676 taken from a single counterfeiter, <persName>Garrit Van Voorhees</persName>, One <persName>David Wallace</persName> brought £1000 of false <placeName>Jersey</placeName> bills to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>; in a haystack on the farm of <persName>Dr. William Hooker Smith</persName> bills amounting to £739 were found; in the lodgings of <persName corresp="#viaf_67928799">Zachariah Allen</persName> the authorities came upon thirty-two £3 counterfeits and £70 worth of merchandise presumably purchased with false bills; <persName>Archilaus Lewis</persName> was supposed to have passed between £75 and £85 in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName>; <persName>John Davis</persName>, when arrested in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5129915">Orange County</placeName>, had £3500 in counterfeit <placeName>Jersey</placeName> bills on his person; <persName corresp="#viaf_44738983">Owen Sullivan</persName> confessed to having struck off £12 000 of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224323">Rhode Island</placeName> money and passed £1600 of it in a single day; he also made £10 000 or £12 000 of
<pb n="197"/>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_5090174">New Hampshire</placeName> currency and large sums of four different emissions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>; <persName>Ashur Baton</persName>, apprehended in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, had £1400 in false <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bills on him; a committee of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> Assembly in 1773 reported that more than £1200 in false bills had been recently stopped, while the whole emission of February, 1771, had to be called in to have thin printed slips of paper pasted on the backs of the true bills; <persName>Samuel Ford</persName> had worked at his nefarious trade for many years before he fled and had been so successful and prolific that his associates called him the treasurer of the three provinces. So masterful was his work, that he never uttered any of it until it had first passed the inspection of the treasurer of the province whose bills he was counterfeiting.</p>
            <p>The losses of the poor and ignorant must have been, for those days, enormous, for they were the ones who chiefly suffered. It was due to the enterprise of individuals and magistrates and the severe laws of the colony that the currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> was not discredited, as for example, was that of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>, where, in March, 1773, the governor informed the assembly that all emissions of their currency in circulation were so cleverly counterfeited as to make it "almost impossible for those the most knowing in such Matters to distinguish the good from the bad."<ref target="#CH16-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Indeed, when, in the fall of 1773, the horseraces were held at <placeName>Leedes Town</placeName> on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4366037">Potomac</placeName>, "there was not half the money depending that would have been risqued on this capital event, as the Marylanders would not stake their property against the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> currency, which has been counterfeited in a manner unparalelled."<ref target="#CH16-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>As far as metallic currency is concerned, there was already in the seventeenth century clipping of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_null">Spanish</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> coins, and throughout the entire Colonial Period there were persons who counterfeited Spanish pieces of eight, quarters, half joes, doubloons and guineas, for Spanish, Portuguese and French coin was current in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. In 1753–1754 the City of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> found its economy
<pb n="198"/>
seriously upset by a flood of false English halfpence and the resulting mistrust of all halfpence, good and bad alike. Seven hundred and forty one pounds of these coins were delivered into Quarter Sessions in 1754 and melted down as false.</p>
            <p>It was only logical that persons experienced in working in metals were in some cases tempted to employ their skill in counterfeiting coin, silversmiths such as <persName>Garrett Onclebagg</persName>, <persName>Charles Hamilton</persName>, <persName>Gideon Casey</persName>,<ref target="#CH16-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> and <persName>Gilbert Belcher</persName>, or tinkers, as <persName>Patrick Butler</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_78711114">John Jubeart</persName>; or the son of a brazier, as <persName>Bastian Killet</persName>. Makers of false bills must of necessity possess technical skill, and among those accused or convicted of counterfeiting were printers and engravers, <persName>James Mark</persName>, <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName>, <persName>Lewis Jones</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_44738983">Owen Sullivan</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_18700040">Joseph Bill Packer</persName> and <persName>Samuel Ford</persName>.</p>
            <p>Would-be counterfeiters, however, who were lacking in such technical knowledge had to apply to reputable craftsmen, a proceeding which often would result in a rebuff or in the denunciation of the criminals to the magistrates: thus a <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> printer sent off a man, probably an accomplice of <persName>Budd</persName> and <persName>Gustine</persName>, who made a suspicious request for type; an engraver in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5223593">Newport</placeName> denounced <persName>Budd</persName> and caused his arrest; three other engravers did the same when asked to make plates for printing bills: <persName>Abraham Ilive</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> reported to the authorities <persName>Robert Jenkins</persName>; in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>
               <persName>John Hastier</persName>, goldsmith and engraver, informed about <persName>Samuel Flood</persName> and <persName>Joseph Steel</persName>, while <persName>Elisha Gallaudet</persName> led off <persName>Timothy Green</persName> to a magistrate.</p>
            <p>The temptation to counterfeit and pass proved too strong not only for silversmiths, blacksmiths, tinkers, printers and engravers but also for persons in many walks of life. Among those accused or convicted of those crimes were represented such occupations as the following: yeoman, mariner, laborer, cordwainer, bloomer, carpenter, merchant, victualler, baker, schoolmaster, tailor, boatman, tavernkeeper, perukemaker, doctor, deacon, justice of the peace, soldier, lieutenant, captain, and colonel.</p>
            <pb n="199"/>
            <p>Not many women appear to have been involved in the business in the province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. Four, <persName>Susannah Elliot</persName>, <persName>Sophia Thomas</persName>, <persName>Anna Vanderspiegel</persName> and <persName>Mary Barnes</persName>, were charged with clipping or passing clipped coins but none were convicted. <persName>Catherine Johnson</persName>, however, the wife of the counterfeiter, <persName>Joseph Johnson</persName>, was found guilty of uttering false bills and was given twenty-one lashes on the bare back; <persName>Margaret Haynnie</persName>, who passed false dollars, was given twenty-one lashes and three months at hard labor; <persName corresp="#viaf_18700040">Joseph Bill Packer</persName>, of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106841">Albany County</placeName> Gang, stated that "<persName>Miss Polly</persName>," the sister of <persName>Daniel Lewis</persName>, a money maker, "an active, accomplished young lady, distributed the ink upon the plates when the impression was struck," but there is no evidence that she was ever brought to justice.</p>
            <p>Many counterfeiters who had been apprehended escaped from the constables or from jail and often were not caught again; this was partly due to the generally deplorable insecurity of the jails, against which complaints are numerous in the minutes of the courts of general sessions of the various counties; several justices of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5115580">Dutchess County</placeName>, indeed, in a petition to the governor complained that the county jail was "by no means strong and secure enough" to hold the counterfeiters imprisoned there, while in 1761 the attorney general felt constrained to write to the sheriff of that county, sternly warning him of the penalties in case he allowed the counterfeiter, <persName>Hamilton</persName>, to escape. The high level of intelligence which their activities demanded made it all the more difficult to keep counterfeiters in custody, as is revealed by the escapes of <persName>Van Voorhees</persName>, <persName>Ichabod Higgins</persName>, <persName>Odell</persName>, <persName>Ford</persName> and others.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, money makers in many instances could count on the assistance of confederates and sympathizers, as is illustrated by the jail break of <persName>Hubbs</persName> and others from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144336">White Plains</placeName>, or that of <persName>John Finkell</persName> from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5115580">Dutchess County</placeName> jail, in which his helper may have been a guard. Again, Justice <persName>Munro</persName> informed the governor that two constables, who, he believed, were concerned with the counterfeiters, suffered one felon to escape and let another go free when they were
<pb n="200"/>
supposed to be taking them to jail. "What," wrote <persName>Munro</persName>, "can a Justice do when the whole country combinds against him?" And sometimes even a magistrate could be remiss in such cases, as was <persName>Justice Dunning</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5129915">Orange County</placeName>, who, instead of prosecuting <persName>Obediah Smith</persName> for altering bills, let him go after causing him to burn the evidence.</p>
            <p>The suppression of counterfeiting was rendered almost impossible because of the great difficulty of obtaining convictions, for, as a committee of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> Assembly observed, the passing of counterfeit money was "an Offence rarely to be proved," and the records which have been preserved give the names of sixteen persons indicted but acquitted, or, in a number of cases, not prosecuted because of insufficiency of evidence. Many, also, who were found guilty were pardoned, as <persName>Berry</persName>, <persName>Mark</persName>, <persName>Jones</persName>, <persName>Meigs</persName>, <persName>Hulbert</persName> and <persName>Bassong</persName>. Sometimes, moreover, counterfeiters who were granted bail, as <persName>Coe</persName>, <persName>Lewis</persName> and <persName>Adams</persName>, who might have been brought to trial and convicted, preferred to forfeit their bonds rather than risk the penalty of death. Only three, <persName>Thomas Lynstead</persName>, <persName>Charles Hamilton</persName>, and <persName>Jonathan Woodman</persName>, chose suicide to standing trial.</p>
            <p>There was, upon occasion, cooperation between the provinces<ref target="#CH16-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> but this depended upon the personal relations between the governors or the desire of one governor to oblige another. Often, however, there was apathy about the falsification of the bills of another province, and in this respect the <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> colonies, notably <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>, were particularly blameworthy. "To the extreme Laxity of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> Laws towards this Species of Offenders," read a report of a committee of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> Council, "it may be owing that the Bills of Credit of this Colony are so generally and greatly disparaged." In 1751 a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> newspaper commented bitterly, with reference to the acquittal of <persName>Samuel Dunston</persName> by a jury in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5090174">New Hampshire</placeName>, although he had been involved with <persName>Woodman</persName> and <persName>Bill</persName>: "<hi rend="italic">And it could hardly be unknown to the People of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5091383">Portsmouth</placeName>; since the Account of his flying from hence was in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> Papers, but as those Govern</hi>-
<pb n="201"/>
               <hi rend="italic">ments are soon to have no more Paper Money, they may tis like, be little concerned about it</hi>." And again, when <persName>John Stevens</persName> died on the gallows, the same paper had earlier commented: "<hi rend="italic">If some of our neighbouring Governments would but act with equal Justice, it might be presumed, these Pests of Society would be something scarcer</hi>."</p>
            <p>The detection and apprehension of counterfeiters were sometimes directed by the governor's council, as in the case of <persName>Thomas Lynstead</persName>; in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> the mayor, recorder, aldermen and magistrates took an active part; in the counties the justices of the peace were responsible for such matters, and some who especially distinguished themselves by their zeal were <persName>Bartholomew Noxon</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5115580">Dutchess County</placeName> and <persName>Munro</persName>, <persName>Adgate</persName>, <persName>Whiting</persName>, <persName>Savage</persName> and <persName>Culver</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106841">Albany County</placeName>. Particularly brilliant work was carried out by persons from other provinces: <persName>Colonel Elijah Williams</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> played a leading part in breaking up the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5106841">Albany County</placeName> Gang, while <persName>Robert Clarke</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> and <persName>Justice Samuel Canfield</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> deserve the credit for bringing about the downfall of the <placeName>Oblong</placeName> Gang. <persName>Eliphalet Beacher</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4831725">Connecticut</placeName> brought about the arrest and conviction of <persName corresp="#viaf_44738983">Owen Sullivan</persName>. The persons who actually caught <persName>Jonathan Woodman</persName> and his associate, Bill, were apparently <persName>Robert Benson</persName> and <persName>Abraham Mills</persName>.</p>
            <p>The laws of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> were severe and by the time of the Revolution almost every conceivable form of counterfeiting, altering, or passing was punishable by death without benefit of clergy. The sentences meted out and the development of the legislation concerned with counterfeiting show that in the earliest period counterfeiting, clipping and passing were treated as "cheats." Thus, in 1680, <persName>Burrell</persName>, who confessed, was ordered to make restitution and fined, while <persName>Shore</persName>, who made no confession but was convicted, was given thirty lashes on the bare back; in 1698 <persName>Ludlow</persName>, convicted of passing, was sentenced to make restitution, pay the costs of the special sessions at which he was tried, pay £3 for the use of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5141390">Trinity Church</placeName> where the trial was held, and give security for his good behavior for three months; in 1702 <persName>Garrett Onclebagg</persName>, convicted of counterfeiting coin,
<pb n="202"/>
was fined £20 and costs and ordered to give security for his good behavior for one year. Such cases as these and the need of a remedy produced the law of 1702, to be in effect for one year, which set the penalty of imprisonment for a year and a day and forfeit of all goods and chattels for counterfeiting, filing, clipping or passing of foreign coin which was current in the colony.</p>
            <p>In 1706 two false coiners — the law of 1702 had expired — <persName>Vank</persName> and <persName>Roberts</persName>, were whipped at the cart's tail and sentenced to pass one hour in the pillory. Doubtless their cases and perhaps others not recorded caused the government on October 6, 1708, to revive the law of 1702, now to be in force for ten years. In 1709 the first law for the emission of paper bills was passed, and this, and all succeeding acts of the same nature, made the counterfeiting of the bills a felony without benefit of clergy. Thus, when in 1713, <persName>Berry</persName> and <persName>Mark</persName> were convicted of the offence, they were sentenced to be hanged and only escaped death through a royal pardon.</p>
            <p>A law of November 19, 1720, established the death penalty without benefit of clergy for counterfeiting, altering or passing counterfeited or altered bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. In 1725 <persName>John Jones</persName> was convicted of passing such an altered bill and doubtless would have been sentenced to die on the gallows if a pardon had not been granted him. On November 11 of the following year a law was passed authorizing the stopping of counterfeited and altered bills and the destruction of them before a court.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Wallace</persName> and <persName>Willson</persName> in 1727 were convicted of passing false bills, but, as these were currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> and not of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, their offence was not a felony but a cheat, for which, however, extremely harsh punishment was inflicted: <persName>Wallace</persName> was sentenced to spend an hour in the pillory, to be carted, to be given thirty-nine stripes in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q500416">New York County</placeName>, then to spend one hour in the pillory and to be given thirty-nine stripes in both <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q11980692">Kings County</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5133268">Queens County</placeName>, next to stand an hour in the pillory and to receive twenty stripes in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144050">Westchester County</placeName>, and finally to remain six months in jail in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> and then to be discharged, paying his fees; <persName>Willson</persName>'s

punishment was somewhat lighter, an hour in the pillory, twenty-eight stripes and carting in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q500416">New York County</placeName>, an hour in the pillory and twenty-eight stripes in both <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q11980692">Kings County</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5133268">Queens County</placeName>, one hour in the pillory and ten stripes in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144050">Westchester County</placeName>, all this to be followed by three months imprisonment in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> and discharge upon payment of fees.</p>
            <p>In 1730 <persName>John Conner</persName>, convicted of coining, was hanged, on the basis of what law does not seem clear, since the law of 1708 had expired; in 1734 <persName>Thomas Copley</persName>, found guilty of uttering a false dollar, was sentenced to one hour in the pillory, thirty lashes and payment of fees, and in the light of this penalty it is difficult to explain the imposition of the death penalty in the case of <persName>Conner</persName>. The following year <persName>Catherine Johnson</persName>, convicted of passing counterfeit bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, for which offence she could have been put to death, was let off, perhaps because of her sex, with twenty lashes and payment of fees. <persName>Patrick Butler</persName>, found guilty of passing counterfeit coin, in 1737 was sentenced by the Mayor's Court to spend a quarter of an hour in the pillory, to be carted and to be given thirty-nine lashes, after which he was to be deported to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5144050">Westchester County</placeName> and forbidden to return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York City</placeName> for six months.</p>
            <p>A law of December 6, 1737, reaffirmed the death penalty of the act of November 19, 1720, but added that even if the crime was committed outside of the colony, indictments could be found against those guilty of counterfeiting, altering or passing counterfeited or altered bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>. In 1739 <persName>Samuel Flood</persName>, whose offence was requesting an engraver to make plates for him, was sentenced by the Mayor's Court to be carted and given thirty-nine lashes, after which he was ordered to leave the city and province within forty-eight hours and forbidden to return within six months. The same year this court sentenced <persName>Margaret Haynnie</persName>, convicted of uttering false dollars, to receive twenty-one lashes and spend three months at hard labor in the <placeName>House of Correction</placeName>, a considerably lighter penalty than that meted out in 1734 to a man, <persName>Thomas Copley</persName>, for the like offence.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>John Stevens</persName>, convicted of making and passing false bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, in 1744 received the death penalty. The next year the counterfeiting and passing of foreign coin by <persName>Killet</persName>, <persName>Ryan</persName>, <persName>Moore</persName> and <persName>Maser</persName> apparently brought about the passage of the law of November 29, 1745, which fixed the penalty of death without benefit of clergy for the counterfeiting or passing of counterfeited French, Spanish or Portuguese gold or silver money. It should be noted that <persName>Maser</persName>, for want of a severe law, had escaped with the trifling fine of £5 and costs. After the new act of 1745 it is difficult to explain why the Court of General Sessions of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5129915">Orange County</placeName> in 1752 let off one <persName>Peter Bakcas</persName>, convicted of passing brass and other base metal for gold, with a fine of £2 and costs, unless the metal he passed was not coin.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1756 the notorious <persName corresp="#viaf_44738983">Owen Sullivan</persName> paid with his life for having counterfeited the bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, and, as his plates, tools and materials were being concealed by his accomplices, the law of July 6, 1756, fixed death without benefit of clergy for those concealing these or contriving such objects or assisting therein.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>John Higgins</persName>, found guilty of altering and passing <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> bills, was hanged in 1762, in accordance with law. <persName>John Davis</persName>, however, convicted in 1766 of passing and causing to be passed false bills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>, could not be punished with death, since his offence was technically a "deceit." He was, therefore, required to pass one hour in the pillory and find security in the amount of £1000 for his good behavior for one year. The <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> Assembly promptly moved to close the loophole by which <persName>Davis</persName> had escaped death, and on July 3, 1766, the penalty of death without benefit of clergy was fixed for counterfeiting the bills of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> colony which passed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The following year <persName>Timothy Green</persName>, who confessed to having tried to have a plate made for counterfeiting the currency of another colony, was sentenced for this "misdemeanor" to spend one hour in the pillory, to be whipped through the city at the cart's tail, and to receive thirty-nine lashes on the bare back. In 1769 <persName corresp="#viaf_78711114">John Jubeart</persName> was hanged for passing false dollars; in 1773 <persName>Lovely</persName>, <persName>Packer</persName> and <persName>Belcher</persName> died on the gallows for counterfeiting and passing the currency of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>, while <persName>Hulbert</persName>, who received the same sentence for the crime, was
<pb n="205"/>
pardoned. Another recipient of royal grace was <persName>Felix Meigs</persName>, who had been condemned to death in 1772 for passing false £3 bills. In 1775 <persName>Nicholas Bassong</persName> was convicted of passing a false Spanish quarter of a dollar, but was pardoned before sentence was imposed. And, finally, in 1776, <persName>Henry Dawkins</persName> and the Young brothers, who a little earlier would beyond doubt been have been sentenced to death for their counterfeiting activities, were sent to prison by the Provincial Assembly of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The path of the counterfeiter in Colonial <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> would have been a much easier one, had it not been for the public spirited activity of the printers of the newspapers. Cautions, which warned the public of false bills and coins and pointed out the harmful effects of their circulation on fair traders, commerce, and the people in general, were generally accompanied by careful directions how to tell the spurious from the genuine. "Cautions of this kind," stated one newspaper in 1761, "whenever necessary, are certainly right," and it added that it should be the care of everyone to bring the offenders to punishment. Indeed, the printers of the newspapers often had a very personal interest in detecting counterfeit bills, as well as the background necessary to point out the manner in which the false ones differed from the true, for in many instances the printer of the newspaper had also printed the true bills of credit of the province. Thus the emissions of July 24, 1724, of November 11, 1726, of October 17, 1730, of November 28, 1734, and of October 25, 1739, were all printed by <persName>William Bradford</persName>, publisher of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName>'s first newspaper, <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New-York</placeName> Gazette</hi>.<ref target="#CH16-n5">

            <p>It has been seen that not even the penalty of death could eradicte counterfeiting. There was, to be sure, one method which would unquestionably have reduced the extent of the mischief and furthermore this method was known. This is the use of a "WATERMARK." As early as September 27, 1739, the printer of the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName> Weekly News-Letter</hi> wrote:
<q>Notwithstanding the Laws made to prevent counterfeiting the Bills of Credit currently passing among us, it seems the Penalty of Death itself will not deter Persons from that wicked Practice, it plainly appearing from Time to Time that there are large Quantities of Counterfeit Bills put off and shifted about, to the great Damage of the Commonwealth in general and of the Honest Dealer in particular: We are therefore desired to inform the Publick of the Method which the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> took to prevent the counterfeiting of their Bills or Notes, which they never could do till they came to it: They procured a Pair of Paper-Moulds exactly the Dimension of their Bills, with several Devices in the said Moulds: They also engag'd a Paper-Maker who procured a peculiar sort of Stuff for making the Paper, which is of that Nature and Quality that no other Paper is made of the same; and it is of such Strength as that it wears ten Times longer than any other sort of Paper whatever; and the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> have never had one Bill counterfeited since they have followed the above Method.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Had the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> authorities heeded this suggestion, their troubles with counterfeiters would have been fewer.</p>
            <p>As it was, in spite of the cautions in the newspapers, the severity of the laws, and the rewards offered from time to time by the government for the conviction of counterfeiters, the evil grew steadily with the increase in population, both in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5128581">New York</placeName> and in the other colonies. Thus, when the Revolution broke out, there were hundreds of skilled counterfeiters banded together to defraud the public. The majority of them doubtless adopted the same philosophy as that of <persName>Henry Dawkins</persName> and his associates, who figured that the Tories would
<pb n="207"/>
counterfeit the Continental and provincial issues, so that they might as well do it too. And when the British and the loyalists undertook the business of counterfeiting the currency of their opponents in order to undermine the Continental economy, their efforts, added to those of the criminal gangs already in existence, contributed largely to the utter collapse of the Continental currency.<ref target="#CH16-n9">
