            <p>In this monograph we have attempted to make a preliminary reconstruction of the monetary systems of Chinese antiquity. From the pages which follow we hope our readers will find that our attempt has been fruitful.</p>
            <p>The reason for the choice of this topic is twofold. Firstly, practically no historical literature has been preserved which provides information concerning ancient Chinese coinages, though the coinages must have played an important part in the nation's economic, social and political development. Secondly, coins of ancient <name type="place">China</name> have been found in such large numbers in recent decades that they should provide helpful data for serious works in the field of historical studies, and negligence to use them should be inexcusable.</p>
            <p>The American Numismatic Society possesses, in our opinion, the largest single collection of Chinese coins in the world. Its officers and council have long felt the necessity of such a work as the present one as a step towards developing the scholarly potentialities of its cabinet in the advancement of numismatic and historical studies of Chinese civilization. For this reason, I was generously granted the opportunity and provided with all necessary facilities to prepare this monograph.</p>
            <p>The collection of the ancient Chinese coins at the Museum of the American Numismatic Society consists of 4,350 specimens not including cowries, cowrie imitations and the so-called "Ant Nose Money." A part of the Museum's collection was acquired by the Society itself in the course of many years. The greater part was donated by Mrs. <name type="pname">Eric N. Baynes</name>, daughter of the late <name type="pname">John Reilly, Jr</name>., who during his life time made the collection of Chinese coins his chief interest and built up a very large and excellent cabinet. The bulk of the Reilly collection was originally that of <name type="pname">Henry Ramsden</name>, the famous numismatist of the early years of this century. It was on the basis of the collection at the Museum of the American Numismatic Society, occasionally supplemented by information gathered from previously published coin catalogues, that this monograph was prepared.</p>
            <pb n="viii"/>
            <p>In preparing the monograph at the Society's Museum, I have enjoyed the complete confidence of Mr. <name type="pname">Sydney P. Noe</name>, Chief Curator of the Society, who relieved me from administrative duties in order to let me concentrate on my research. I benefited also from the kind encouragement and advice of Dr. <name type="pname">George C. Miles</name>, Curator of Islamic Coins and President of the <name type="place">New York</name> Oriental Club. Everyone of my colleagues at the Museum have extended assistance to me, especially Mr. <name type="pname">Sawyer McA</name>. <name type="pname">Mosser</name>, Secretary and Editor, and Mr. <name type="pname">William L. Clark</name>, Curator of Mediaeval and Modern Coins. To Mr. <name type="pname">Mosser</name> I must particularly express my heartfelt thanks for the revision of the manuscript. Without his help this monograph might have never reached the public.</p>
            <p>Outside the Museum generous assistance has been received from friends and libraries. Dr. <name type="pname">Roswell S</name>. <name type="pname">Britton</name>, Professor at <name type="place">New York</name> University, was consulted on various questions. He and Dr. <name type="pname">L. Carrington Goodrich</name>, Professor at Columbia University, read the manuscript and made valuable suggestions which have been incorporated in the monograph. Mr. <name type="pname">H. F. Bowker</name>, a Fellow of the American Numismatic Society, kindly lent books from his private library, and the Eastern Asiatic Collection of Columbia University, the Chinese and Japanese Library of Harvard University, and the library of the American Geographical Society also extended to me the privilege of using their facilities. Miss <name type="pname">Miwa Kai</name>, Senior Assistant at the Eastern Asiatic Collection, Columbia University, frequently assisted me, and checked transliterations of Japanese personal names and titles of Japanese books.</p>
            <p>These are only a few of the names which might be mentioned in grateful acknowledgement. The author has likewise benefited from the labor of the coin collectors, numismatists, and scholars in the general historical field of the past as well as from the academic achievements of those of the present.</p>
            <p>If any contribution has been made to Chinese numismatics and the historical studies of ancient <name type="place">China</name> in this monograph, it certainly has not been made by this writer alone.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Though still young as a science, Chinese numismatics has had a long history. It may be said to have had its inception in the sixth century when a scholar named Liu compiled <name type="place">China's</name> first coin catalogue, which was entitled <hi rend="italic">Ch'ien chih</hi> (Records of Coins). According to Sun I-jang (1848—1908), the numismatist Liu was Liu Ch'ien (484—550) who is better known for his other scholarly works.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> Liu Ch'ien's catalogue seems to have been lost some time during the <name type="place">Sui dynasty</name> (581—618). Our information about him and his numismatic work is derived from references to him and a few quotations from his writings by a contemporary, <name type="pname">Ku Hsüan</name>, compiler of the famous <hi rend="italic">Ch'ien p'u</hi> (Coin catalogue).<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The text of <name type="pname">Ku Hsüan's</name> catalogue has also been lost. The work is recorded in the section on literature in the official history for the <name type="place">Sui dynasty</name>, and passages from it are quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Ch'üan chih</hi> (Records of Coins) by <name type="pname">Hung Tsun</name> (1120—1174).<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> Judging from these quotations, <name type="pname">Ku Hsüan's</name> catalogue seems to have had no specimens of coins of the Chou period, and of the periods following the <name type="place">Chou dynasty</name> he apparently recorded only the few coins which he had seen himself. The later the coin, the more detailed his description, which usually included the coin's design, its legend and its issuing date. His method of coin description became the pattern for later Chinese numismatists.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Ku Hsüan</name> was followed by a few numismatists during the T'ang dynasty (618—907). Among them the most famous is <name type="pname">Füng Yen</name>, a scholar who is better known for his "Things Seen and Things Heard," whose work on coins is entitled <hi rend="italic">Hsü ch'ien p'u</hi>, presumably a coin
<pb n="2"/>
catalogue supplementing the one by <name type="pname">Ku Hsüan</name>. Although this work is lost also, enough fragments have been preserved to give us an idea of the work done in numismatics by the T'ang scholars. The first recorded discovery of <name type="place">Chou</name> coins seems to have taken place in <name type="pname">Füng Yen's</name> time. For each coin known to have come from a find, he recorded the circumstances of its discovery and the conditions under which he was able to examine it.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> Otherwise, his statements were confined to the shape and size of the coin and the structural composition of the characters in the legend. He did not, however, venture to interpret the meaning of the legend.</p>
               <p>Though limited in scope, the numismatists of T'ang were unpresumtuous and their reports seem to be reliable. The same cannot be said of the numismatists of the <name type="place">Sung dynasty</name> (960—1279 A. D.) which followed T'ang. By their time both the Early Knife coins and the Old Spade coins of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period had been unearthed. Judging from the information available, all these pieces bore legends. Puzzled by the strange archaic forms of the characters in the inscriptions and firmly believing in the legendary stories of prehistoric <name type="place">China</name> which had been built up gradually since the Han time (206 B. C.—220 A. D.), the numismatists and historians of the <name type="place">Sung dynasty</name> indulged in conjectural decipherment and interpretation of the <name type="place">Chou</name> coin legends. They believed all these coins to be of prehistoric origin. Tung Yu (fl. 1101—1125), compiler of a coin catalogue, assigned some <name type="place">Chou</name> coins as issues of the period of T'ai-hao, a legendary figure of the very early mythical history of <name type="place">China</name>. Dissatisfied with Tung Yu's attribution as being too late, Lo Mi, an historian well versed in legendary history, placed a coin as early as Kuo-t'ien,<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> another mythical figure who, if he ever actually lived, would have been contemporary with the Peking Man. <name type="pname">Hung Tsun's</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ch'üan chih</hi>, the earliest coin catalogue extant, was a product of this period.</p>
               <pb n="3"/>
               <p>However ill founded the allegations of the Sung scholars were, their opinions prevailed for some six hundred years in the field of Chinese numismatics and lasted well into the eighteenth century. <name type="pname">Liu Shih-lu</name>, one of the foremost numismatists of the nineteenth century, still attributed spade coins of Liang, capital of the state of <name type="place">Wei</name>, of the Chan-kuo period (403—221 B. C.), to the dynasties of Yü and Hsia, both of which precede the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty in the second millennium B. C. Another of his conjectures, likewise groundless, considered these coins as issues for use in the payment of fines. His interpretations are contained in his essay, the <hi rend="italic">Yü Hsia shu-chin shih-wün</hi>,<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> which later became a classic, widely read and admired by both Chinese and Western numismatists into the early years of the twentieth century. The dependence of Chinese numismatic studies on mythology did not disappear until Ts'ai Yün (1764—1824), an historian and philologist interested in numismatics, declared that the ancient copper coins preserved today were not objects of remote antiquity but were rather currencies which "flourishingly circulated during the Ch'un-Ch'iu and the Chan-kuo periods (770—221 B. C.)."<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Like Chinese classics, philology and history, Chinese numismatics witnessed an unprecedented advancement in the Manchu period (1644—1911) and produced a methodology that can be considered scientific. In the decipherment of the coin inscriptions, especially those on the coins of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period, there are the famous names of Ts'ai Yün, Ma Ang and <name type="pname">Liu Hsin-yüan</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> Of these, Ts'ai Yün is also known for his contribution to the studies of coin chronology. These scholars demonstrated that the legends on the <name type="place">Chou</name> coins are not the names of T'ai-hao and Kuo-t'ien but the names of cities or towns of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period. Not one of these three scholars, however, was a professional numismatist; their chief interest and contributions were historical and epigraphic.</p>
               <p>In a narrow sense of the term, scientific numismatics was not
<pb n="4"/>
established in <name type="place">China</name> until the publication in 1864 of the famous catalogue, <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'üan hui</hi>, by <name type="pname">Li Tso-hsien</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> This catalogue contains illustrations of more than five thousand specimens accompanied by decipherment of their legends and, whenever possible, notes of their history. The author examined carefully and determined the authenticity of every specimen in his catalogue, and excluded those whose authenticity he could not verify. This careful attitude is not found in the works of any of his predecessors. It may be safely said that his is the first scientific work in Chinese numismatics. Up to the present time his catalogue is still regarded as the best and most reliable by numismatists. It constitutes the backbone of the comprehensive <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'ien ta tz'ǔ-tien</hi> (Encyclopaedia of Old Coins) published in 1938.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In spite of the progress made by scholars and numismatists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, study of coins in <name type="place">China</name> failed to arouse wide attention. It was pursued largely by a limited group of wealthy gentry and retired officials. These elderly gentlemen, withdrawn from the tumultuous experiences of earlier years, foundserenity of life in the companionship of antiquities. In satisfying their personal desires for large collections and in persistent search for rare specimens, they did a great service to the study of an important phase of ancient Chinese civilization in gathering the basic materials for its serious study. The only regrettable fact is that, in many cases, these men, not being trained historians and philologists, were unable to undertake satisfactorily the study of the coins. As a result, they needed the assistance of the epigraphers in deciphering coin legends. These epigraphers, in their study of the inscriptions on <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> bronzes, were led to the study of those on coins in the hope that it might help their primary work. This situation produced a somewhat bilateral development in ancient Chinese numismatics. On the one hand, the collector-numismatists studied the coin specimens but were unable to contribute substantially in deciphering the legends; on the other hand, the epigraphical scholars studied their inscriptions but neglected all other aspects of the coins. Neither group
<pb n="5"/>
possessed the knowledge of the other, but both contributed toward the advancement of ancient Chinese numismatics. If the knowledge and the interest of both had been combined, numismatic studies in <name type="place">China</name> might have advanced further.</p>
               <p>Chinese numismatists of the nineteenth century paid little attention in their studies to the evidence of the coins themselves.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Li Tso-hsien</name>, the foremost Chinese numismatist of that century, did formulate a proposed systematic program for numismatic studies some ten years after his famous catalogue was published in 1864. This embraced investigation of the following: epigraphy on coins, metrology, the shapes and designs of coins, provenance, stories and anecdotes about coins and collectors, and rare specimens and specimens recorded but not seen.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> Li's proposed methodology marked a great step forward. Especially commendable is his emphasis on inquiry into the provenance of coins and their metrology. Yet, effort along these lines alone is not sufficient to enable us to exploit fully the evidence that coins can provide concerning the history of economic institutions. Study of the physical characteristics of the coins and of their inscriptions constitute the foundation of Chinese numismatics, but they alone are not enough. In order to fully understand the historical significance of the coins we must examine them against the general political, social and economic background of the period in which they circulated. Therefore, a competent numismatist must not only be an able coin examiner but an epigrapher and historian as well.<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> So far, no Chinese numismatist has attained this happy combination.</p>
               <p>In recent years, serious attempts have been made to raise the level of numismatic studies in <name type="place">China</name>. In 1938, Ting Fu-pao published the
<pb n="6"/>
coin encyclopaedia, <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'ien ta tz'ǔ-tien.</hi> In this work he entered many published specimens of Chinese coins and specimens in the possession of private collectors in <name type="place">China</name>. A large proportion of the illustrations are reproductions from coin rubbings. Under each specimen he has given all previously published statements and discussions concerning it, and these have been reproduced by photographic process so that they may contain no errors. It is the most comprehensive coin catalogue in Chinese.</p>
               <p>In 1940 the Chinese Numismatic Society was established in <name type="place">Shanghai</name> by a group of coin collectors and numismatists. It published a bi-monthly <hi rend="italic">Ch'üan-pi</hi>, known in English as <hi rend="italic">Chinese Numismatics</hi>, to promote numismatic studies. In his introductory words explaining the plans and aims of the Society in publishing the bi-monthly, Chang Chiung-po outlines a program of numismatic studies which the members of the organization are asked to follow. He first expresses his dissatisfaction with the attitude of Chinese scholars and historians who have hitherto regarded coins as "small things" unworthy of their attention. He urges rectification of this mistaken attitude and the recognition of coins as valid historical material. He suggests that "systematic researches" must be made of them in which the examination of actual specimens be made, historical records be consulted, and that coins be treated as relics of an economic and historical institution which can be studied in the light of monetary theories. Commenting on the situation in which persons writing about the history of coinage do not actually handle the coins and those who actually handle them lack the necessary scientific training to write about coinages, he states that there must be a combination of both.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref>
               </p>
               <p>On the whole, Chang's program is well conceived, as it pointedly sets out to rectify the weaknesses in past Chinese numismatic studies. The bi-monthly appeared periodically until the end of 1945. It carried some interesting discussions and a number of articles which were written on a much higher level than ever before. But on the whole the
<pb n="7"/>
effort of the members of the Chinese Numismatic Society fell short of the goal set by Chang Chiung-po.</p>
               <p>However imperfect the writings of the members of the Chinese Numismatic Society may have been, their efforts in themselves are significant contributions toward advancement of numismatic studies in <name type="place">China</name>. It is regrettable that the bi-monthly of the Society had to exist during the Japanese aggression in <name type="place">China</name> and thus had its influence greatly limited.</p>
               <p>In <name type="place">Japan</name>, Chinese numismatics has been a favorite field with some Japanese sinologists. In that country, too, the study of old coins was generally regarded as a hobby of collectors with means and leisure, and was not accorded the attention it deserved until recently. In the last few decades Japanese archaeologists have conducted some extensive excavations in <name type="place">Korea</name>, <name type="place">Manchuria</name> and <name type="place">Jehol</name>, and in many of the old Chinese remains they found coins of the <name type="place">Chou</name>, the Han and Wang Mang Periods, with which they dated the remains. The discovery of ancient Chinese coins by these archaeological missions seems to have stimulated numismatic interest among Japanese scholars. Probably for this reason, ancient Chinese coins, not only those unearthed from the old remains but also those in the hands of collectors, suddenly acquired the dignity of archaeological objects. It was among Japanese scholars that the question of the initial date of Chinese metallic coinage was first discussed in a scholarly manner.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> These discussions did not prove very fruitful because historical scholarship was not well combined with actual knowledge of the coins, and because the historical sources were not fully understood and exhausted. However, a proper approach was made toward one of the many problems of Chinese coinage.</p>
               <p>In 1938, the same year in which the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Old Coins</hi> was published in <name type="place">China</name>, the <hi rend="italic">Tōa senshi</hi> (Catalogue of Eastern Asiatic Coins) by Okutaira Masahiro appeared in <name type="place">Japan</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> The catalogue consists of eighteen volumes of which twelve are devoted to Chinese coins. The specimens listed in it are illustrated with reproductions of
<pb n="8"/>
well-made rubbings. Besides its typographical excellence, the work can be commended for the number of specimens of rare coins of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period it includes which are not to be found in other coin catalogues. In the decipherment of a number of the controversial coin legends, Okutaira follows the suggestions of <name type="pname">Liu Hsin-yüan</name> and <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name>, noted Chinese experts in epigraphical studies of the <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> bronzes, whose decipherments have been neglected so far by Chinese numismatists. Closely following <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name>, Okutaira attempts to reconstruct the early history of Chinese coinage by making use of the inscriptions on the bronzes of the <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> period. We know of no Chinese numismatists who have ever systematically utilized this valuable source of information.</p>
               <p>Another merit of the catalogue is its illustration of a few specimens of silver ingots and paper money, through which Okutaira has shown superiority over his Chinese colleagues in the realization that study of copper coins alone is not sufficient for a complete understanding of the Chinese monetary system. The work, however, contains no illustrations of coin moulds, also important material in the study of Chinese historical coinages, and a few of those which are listed are likely fabrications.</p>
               <p>In the Western languages, books and articles on Chinese coinage and monetary history have been published in French, English and German. The names of Biot, Vissering and Lacouperie are the most prominent. While in <name type="place">China</name> the effort to reconstruct a general monetary history of <name type="place">China</name> was motivated by the study of the ancient coins and their inscriptions, in the West that effort seems to have been a result of literary researches. The material on which the works of both Biot and Vissering<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> are based is of such a nature. There were no studies of ancient Chinese coins on an appreciable scale until Lacouperie, who in 1892 published his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Chinese Coins.</hi> This work is the most comprehensive treatment of the earlier Chinese coins yet produced by a Western numismatist.</p>
               <pb n="9"/>
               <p>In preparing his work Lacouperie benefited from the intellectual heritage of the Western world. At his time, the numismatic studies of <name type="place">Greece</name> and <name type="place">Rome</name> had developed to maturity, and Lacouperie was able to draw upon the experience of the classical numismatists in tackling some of the problems in Chinese numismatics. This is probably the reason why he shows superiority over his Chinese contemporaries in his historical approach to Chinese coins. However, being a Westerner, Lacouperie naturally suffered from handicaps in preparing his work. He had insufficient training in the Chinese language to avoid misunderstandings of the texts of Chinese historical records.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> His knowledge of Chinese ancient history appears rather limited, and his inexperience in determining authenticity of the coins caused him to enter many spurious specimens in this catalogue.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> He does seem to have had training in Chinese philology — the "ancient script" and its evolution — which is absolutely indispensable in deciphering the coin legends or in judging the plausibility of the decipherments which have been advanced. While in most cases he follows the decipherment of Chinese scholars, he has been confident enough to make up some of his own, on which he formed his theory of the so-called "monetary unions." As <name type="pname">L. C. Hopkins</name> has pointed out,<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> Lacouperie sometimes offers his conjectures as if they were facts, and he makes statements which actually have no foundation.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref>

               <pb n="10"/>
               <p>We should not, however, underrate Lacouperie's contributions because of these shortcomings. If we read his book against the background of his time, we realize it was an admirable accomplishment. When we examine the discussions and publications which appeared after him and in which his influence can be directly or indirectly detected, we must recognize that he contributed much toward the advancement of Chinese numismatics in the Western world.</p>
               <p>Next to Lacouperie among Western numismatists we find the name of <name type="pname">Henry A. Ramsden</name>. A scholar and a collector who collected to study, he promoted interest in the study of Oriental coins in general and Chinese coins in particular. "During his life," states <name type="pname">H. F. Bowker</name>, "he was the prime-mover in the study of the coins of his speciality, and was most probably the direct cause of the popularity which the coins of the Orient enjoyed in the United States during the last years of his life."<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> In 1913 and the year following he edited the <hi rend="italic">Numismatic and Philatelic Journal of <name type="place">Japan</name>
                  </hi>, the bilingual organ of the <name type="place">Yokohama</name> Numismatic Society of which he was then the chairman. The journal devoted part of its pages to the study of Chinese numismatics. In that field <name type="pname">Ramsden's</name> interest covered a wide range from "barter money" to modern coinage, from metallic currency to paper money. A complete list of his works is found in "<name type="pname">Ramsdeniana</name>," in which the author praises him as "the foremost writer and most competent occidental authority in ... Far Eastern numismatics" at the time of his death in 1915.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Since 1915 sinological studies in both <name type="place">Europe</name> and <name type="place">North America</name> have advanced considerably, and consequently the interest in Chinese coins has grown wider not only among collectors and museums but also among students of Chinese history. Yet, ancient Chinese numismatic studies have not progressed as might be desired.</p>
               <p>In 1934, a group of Westerners residing in <name type="place">China</name> formed the Numismatic Society of <name type="place">China</name> in <name type="place">Shanghai</name>, and subsequently published six bulletins, all of which deal with the modern coinage of <name type="place">China</name>. In 1940, after the Chinese Numismatic Society was established, it associated
<pb n="11"/>
itself with the latter in an attempt to combine the efforts of both organizations in the promotion of Chinese numismatic studies in <name type="place">China</name> and abroad.</p>
               <p>If, in the last thirty years, Western numismatists have not produced commendable work in the field of ancient Chinese coinage, a preparatory step has been well taken in the publication <hi rend="italic">A Bibliography on Far Eastern Numismatics</hi> by <name type="pname">A. B. Coole</name> and <hi rend="italic">A Numismatic Bibliography of the Far East</hi> by <name type="pname">H. F. Bowker</name>. The former bibliography is devoted to the listing of numismatic works in Chinese and Japanese, while the latter, supplementing the former, covers the literature in Western languages. Both were carefully prepared and are convenient reference works.</p>
               <p>In the above sketch we may have appeared hypercritical in some of our remarks. It is not intended to discredit our predecessors. The scholarship of one man is bound to be limited, as are his physical energy and the scholarly achievement of his age. If, at the present, numismatists are able to see more problems and penetrate more deeply into them, this is largely owing to the advancement of historical studies in general and Chinese numismatics in particular. Without the effort of the numismatists of the past in collecting the material and preparing the preliminary studies, any new and constructive contributions would be inconceivable.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Observations on the size, weight, fabric, and mint locations of coins can shed invaluable light on the early monetary history of <name type="place">China</name>. The valid interpretation of any of these elements depends on the correct decipherment of the coin's legend. As we have already noted, decipherments of coin legends have in the past been made by epigraphical scholars whose main interest was ancient script and not coins. As a rule, collector-numismatists have followed the readings of these scholars, but, in cases where none had yet been made, they attempted
<pb n="12"/>
their own. They were not trained in epigraphy, and some had not even enough knowledge of philology to determine which of several possible decipherments was the most plausible. Often a collector's guess would be colored by an eagerness to enhance the value of his coin.</p>
                  <p>The mint name <graphic url="NNM122_012a.jpg"/>
                     <hi rend="italic">(lin</hi>, written <graphic url="NNM122_012b.jpg"/>) in modem script) on a group of late spades has been variously read as <graphic url="NNM122_012c.jpg"/>
                     <hi rend="italic">(lu)</hi>, <graphic url="NNM122_012d.jpg"/> (yü), <graphic url="NNM122_012e.jpg"/> (<hi rend="italic">huang</hi>), <graphic url="NNM122_012f.jpg"/> (<hi rend="italic">huang-fu</hi>), <graphic url="NNM122_012g.jpg"/> (<hi rend="italic">chia</hi>), <graphic url="NNM122_012h.jpg"/> (<hi rend="italic">huo</hi>), and <graphic url="NNM122_012i.jpg"/> (<hi rend="italic">kuan</hi>). The last reading, <hi rend="italic">kuan</hi>, which was suggested by Ma Ang and publicised by <name type="pname">Li Tso-hsien</name>, prevailed in the numismatic world for many years. It was followed by Lacouperie and all other Western numismatists. Since neither Ma Ang nor <name type="pname">Li Tso-hsien</name> found Kuan as a place name in historical literature, they assumed the character to be an abbreviation for <hi rend="italic">"kuan-chung,"</hi> a term denoting a region which is now central <name type="place">Shensi</name>. Lacouperie mistakenly called it the "capital city of Ts'in." The correct decipherment of the character, strangely enough, is said to have been made many years before the above suggestions were advanced, by Sun Hsing-yen (styled Yüan-ju, 1753—1818), a scholar in Chinese classics and philology and not a numismatist.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> Sun deciphered the character as the name of a town in the state of Chao during the Chan-kuo period. All numismatists acquainted with recent numismatic studies follow his decipherment.</p>
                  <p>Superior as opinions of epigraphical scholars are in decipherment of coin inscriptions, they are not always correct. Take the character <graphic url="NNM122_012j.jpg"/> for instance, which appears on many Late Spades. Some numismatists read it <hi rend="italic">pa-huo</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_012k.jpg"/> or "eight <hi rend="italic">huo,"</hi>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> the latter character being used here in the sense of a denominational unit. This reading is incorrect. Actually, it is a single character, not a monogram of two; and no part of the character can be construed as <hi rend="italic">huo.</hi> Epigraphical scholars read it as <hi rend="italic">fün</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_012l.jpg"/>, meaning "belongs to the reign of."<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> This decipherment is also wrong, for it is not suggested on the basis of the
<pb n="13"/>
character's structural identity with <hi rend="italic">fün</hi>, but on its resemblance to it. The correct reading is <hi rend="italic">pan</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_013a.jpg"/> (half), a denominational term (with the name of the unit understood) of the coinage of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period. When these coins were in circulation there were only two denominations, a full unit and a half, the unit being <name type="place">
                        <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                     </name>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_013b.jpg"/>. The weight of the coin bearing the legend <hi rend="italic">pan</hi> (half) is just half that of the full unit piece.<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> Had the epigraphers gathered and weighed specimens of both sizes they would not have escaped this conclusion. The same holds true for the deonominational term <hi rend="italic">ling</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_013c.jpg"/> which is found on the larger spades of the state of Ch'in (Late Spade IV) and which has been improperly deciphered.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> By weighing spade coins of Liang of various sizes, <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name>, an able contemporary epigrapher, ascertained the correct reading of the eight-character legend which they bore.<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> It was only after an investigation of the provenance of a group of late square foot spades that Okutaira accepted <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name>'s suggestion that their legend reads "Hsiang-p'ing," a mint located in present day southern Manchuria.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> These examples show how important it is to combine epigraphical and philological with numismatic evidence. The use of one of these types of evidence to the exclusion of the others constitutes one of the chief obstacles encountered in numismatic works of the past as well as the present. It is this situation which is responsible for many unacceptable decipherments, which will have to be reconsidered or discarded in the present study.</p>

                  <p>There are two aspects of ancient Chinese epigraphy: (a) the structural form of the character and (b) the style or manner of executing the character. So far as the structural form of the characters is concerned two changes have taken place which have bearing on the epigraphical chronology of Chinese script. In the course of time, many characters have undergone simplification while many others have become more complicated through acquisition of signifies (i. e., radicals signifying "water," "walled city," etc.). In other words, with some characters, the more complicated their form the older they are; with others, the simpler their form, the older they are. On coins of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period we sometimes find simpler forms of characters of the second group in inscriptions of pieces of a considerably late date, when the complicated form of the character had become the norm. Because of this circumstance, dependence on coin epigraphy alone will fail to determine correctly the date of a coin.</p>
                  <p>The style of <name type="place">Shang</name> bronze inscriptions is characterized by a peculiar execution of the strokes. Each end of the stroke is usually very thin while the central part is broad and thick. This style of script has been called the K'o-tou, or tadpole, script. However, the tadpole script is found also to be the dominant style in inscriptions of the early years of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period. Without considering its content along with other factors, even an expert epigrapher cannot determine to which period an inscription in the script belongs.</p>
                  <p>The period of the <name type="place">Chou</name> dynasty is, for convenience sake, usually divided into three smaller periods: The Western (Early) <name type="place">Chou</name> period covering almost three hundred years from 1122 B. C. (traditional date) or 1027 B. C. to 771 B. C.; the Ch'un-ch'iu period from 770 to 481 B. C.; the Chan-kuo period ending in 221 B. C. During the first period bronzes were almost entirely made by or for kings and ministers of the royal court; during the second and third periods they were made practically only by rulers and nobles of the various feudal states. The style of the inscriptions of these three periods were roughly
<pb n="15"/>
the so-called <hi rend="italic">Ta-chuan</hi> (great "seal" character), the <hi rend="italic">Chou-wün</hi> (slightly simplified <hi rend="italic">Ta-chuan</hi>), and the <hi rend="italic">Hsiao-chuan</hi> (small "seal" character). Whether the <hi rend="italic">Ta-chuan</hi> can be regarded as also the style used in the various feudal states during the first period and whether the other styles found in the various feudal states can be regarded as also the style in the royal domain of <name type="place">Chou</name> during the second and the third periods cannot be said with absolute certainty, especially when we realize that, though so simply stated above, the styles of script during the second and the third periods of <name type="place">Chou</name> present strong local divergence. All these factors complicate any attempt to use comparative study of coin inscriptions and bronze vessel inscriptions in determining dates of coins.</p>
                  <p>Even if we disregard these complications, dating of coins by comparative study of inscriptions on bronzes is made impossible by another circumstance. Coins and bronzes have different epigraphical styles which result from the difference in their purpose and in the techniques of inscribing them. On bronzes, inscriptions were cast on the vessels, which were made in honor of the maker's forefathers or other relatives, to commemorate a victory in war or a royal or princely grant, to glorify his enfeudation as a prince or his appointment to an office, to record an important event or a settlement of a dispute. The personages involved are always kings, princes and upper class nobles. Some of the vessels bearing the inscriptions commemorating enfeudations were kept in the ancestral temples by princes and venerated as symbols of the existence of their states. They thus had a monumental character and their inscriptions were accordingly rendered in a conventional and elegant manner.</p>
                  <p>The coins were not personal treasures of kings, princes or nobles; they were made to be used as media of exchange in a society, the overwhelming majority of which was illiterate. Inscriptions on the coins are merely marks indicating the mint's name, sometimes the serial number of minting, and occasionally also the denomination. To coins of full intrinsic quality, whose value depends largely on their alloy and weight, these marks are not essential; accuracy and elegance
<pb n="16"/>
in style of character are matters of secondary importance. That is probably the reason why the inscriptions on the coins are generally crudely rendered, while those on bronze vessels are usually models of calligraphy. A comparative stylistic study between crude script and highly developed calligraphy is hardly possible.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, whereas the inscriptions on the bronzes were, as generally acknowledged, written by persons with training in calligraphy, those on the coins were left to artisans at the mint, who did not always follow the conventional style and contracted the structure of the characters to the extreme. Technically, inscriptions on bronze vessels were cast from a mould which was made from a model, on which both the designs and the inscription were carved out to the desired fineness. The inscription on the coin was, on the other hand, cast from a mould which was not made after a model and on which the inscription was carved directly and in reverse. As a result, the strokes of the characters on coins were generally in contracted straight lines, for these were much easier to make than curved lines. The straightening of lines and consequently the contraction of the structure of the characters further reduces the possibility of a satisfactory comparative stylistic study of the coin inscriptions with those on bronze vessels.</p>
                  <p>Can we detect an evolution of style within coin inscriptions themselves with which we may find out the order of appearance of the coins? This question also brings complications. The fact is that the coins were cast by local mints many of which undoubtedly belonged to princes and minor nobles and even wealthy private individuals. Under these circumstances local character and individual inclinations could not but exert their influence. T'ang Lan, a contemporary epigrapher who has specialized in the study of inscriptions on oracle bones and bronzes of the <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> dynasties, holds the opinion that during the <name type="place">Chou</name> period the style of script in common use was much more simple and irregular than the official script and that it had influenced the official writings towards the end of the period.<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref>
                     <pb n="17"/>
Local variances render the study of the evolution of the style of coin inscriptions difficult if not altogether impossible. The curious thing is that we find some of the most archaic forms of characters on comparatively late coins cast in the border regions of <name type="place">Chou</name>
                     <name type="place">China</name>, where, sociologically speaking, as in modern colonies, conservatism was usually stronger than the central area.</p>
                  <p>However, this does not mean that epigraphical studies have no bearing at all on the determination of coin chronology. On the whole, we may say they do, but only in a general way. They can be applied only in the cases in which stylistic distinctions can be positively established and this is possible only with either the very old or the very late coins. The older the coins are, the closer is the style of their inscriptions to the <hi rend="italic">Ta-chuan</hi> (great seal character), and the later the coins, the closer to the <hi rend="italic">Hsiao-chuan</hi> (small seal character). The former is identified with the epigraphical style of the inscriptions of the vessels of the Western <name type="place">Chou</name> period, and the latter is the style officially adopted and made universal in 221 B. C. In structure, the <hi rend="italic">Hsiao-chuan</hi> is much simpler.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Another difficulty in studying ancient Chinese coins is the lack of literary records. Excepting the simple terms of <hi rend="italic">pei</hi> (cowrie), <hi rend="italic">tao</hi> (knife coin) and <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> (spade coin), other data regarding the ancient Chinese monetary system is not found in historical literature. The widely believed traditional story about the casting of the "big coins" by King Ching of <name type="place">Chou</name> in 524 B. C. is embodied with unreliable elements (i. e., the remarks made by Shan-mu-kung). The anecdote that King Chuang of Ch'u (613—519 B. C.) aroused resentment among his people by replacing "light" coins with "big" coins, which also has been regarded as factual, must be accepted with reserve. The story recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Kuan-tzǔ</hi> and the "present edition" of the <hi rend="italic">Bamboo Annals</hi> that Ch'üng-T'ang, founder of the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty, cast metallic money is pure folklore. Even if these stories were reliable, they still contain no essential information on ancient Chinese coinage.
<pb n="18"/>
The only reliable material in our possession with regard to monetary systems in Chinese antiquity are the coins themselves, but some problems presented by them are hard to resolve because of the lack of historical records.</p>
                  <p>The major problem that suffers from lack of historical records concerns the date of the origin of coinage in <name type="place">China</name>. The difficulty in dating the earliest coins would be also considerably less if the conditions were known under which the coins had been discovered.</p>
                  <p>What knowledge we have about discoveries of coins is scanty. In the scientific excavations of the Academia Sinica at early <name type="place">Chou</name> and pre-<name type="place">Chou</name> sites in North <name type="place">China</name> only cowries were found.<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> The excavations at Ch'üng-tzǔ-yai in eastern <name type="place">Shantung</name> produced only a broken handle from an early knife coin.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> Ming knives were unearthed among old remains in I county of Hopeh Province by an expedition led by Ma Hüng in 1920.<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> These knives, however, were very late in date. <name type="pname">Mr. Kuo Pao-chün</name> of the Academia Sinica has reported to the author that a number of pointed-foot hollow-handle spades were discovered in <name type="place">Chou</name> tombs of Chün County, <name type="place">Honan</name>. During the last fifty years Japanese archaeologists have excavated both spade and knife coins of the late <name type="place">Chou</name> period in <name type="place">Jehol</name>, <name type="place">Manchuria</name> and <name type="place">Korea</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref> Except for those reported by <name type="pname">Kuo Pao-chün</name> and the handle of the knife coin, there are no reports by excavators of the discovery of early coins.</p>
                  <p>Coins of the earlier periods have been found casually, for the most part by farmers while tilling their fields. From the farmers they passed to collectors, either directly or through coin dealers. Thus, by the
<pb n="19"/>
time they reach the hands of collectors they are isolated objects, completely dissociated with the site of discovery and the other objects with which they had originally been deposited. This condition would not obtain, had their discovery been made under the trained observation of archaeologists. The situation becomes the more regrettable when we realize that tens of thousands of Chou coins have been casually retrieved and, so to speak, lost again.</p>
                  <p>Among the late spade coins there is a group, which, as forerunners of the <hi rend="italic">pan-liang</hi> (half <hi rend="italic">liang</hi>) round coins of imperial Ch'in, are important for the reconstruction of early Chinese coinage. The group is of the round-footed type with three holes (Late Spade IV). Their monetary unit is the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi>, as is specified on the reverse legend, and so far one <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> and half <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> (i. e., 12 <hi rend="italic">chu</hi>) pieces have been found. Fifteen specimens from nine different unidentified mints are known.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> If the places of their discovery and the conditions of their finding were known, it might be possible to locate their mints with some certainty.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>The fourth major difficulty in the study of the <name type="place">Chou</name> coins lies in the identification of the mint names. This difficulty arises not from the lack of historical information, but from, so to speak, the mass of it. With the exception of a few early spades, the coins of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period, be they knives or spades, usually bear a legend or legends on both their obverse and reverse. Part of, or the entire, legend on the obverse is the name of the mint which cast the coin. By locating these mints a reconstruction of the distribution of the coin types can be achieved and the problem of the right of coinage of the minor feudatories can be investigated. But during the <name type="place">Chou</name> period, towns in different states, and sometimes in the same state, may have the same name.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> For
<pb n="20"/>
instance, we find "<name type="place">An-yang</name>" as a mint name in the legend on one group of the early knife coins. In literary sources we find three towns of this name. There are four towns with the name "Chung-tu," which is found on a group of square-foot late spade pieces (Late Spade II). For "P'ing-yang," which appears as the mint-name of some square-foot late spades, there are five towns. Seven are found for "Hsin-ch'üng" (meaning "new city"), a mint name on a group of point-footed late spades (Late Spade I). Such examples would make a long and tedious list.</p>
                  <p>To identify the mints with towns recorded in historical literature is not easy, and there is no literary information available which will help. In solving the question we must depend mostly on our knowledge of the coins themselves. With some degree of certainty we may presume that coins within a general given area will have similar shapes and designs, that they will have the same denominational system. Therefore, by studying these aspects of the coinage of towns neighboring the possible mint we may be able to identify and locate it. Thus, we reach the conclusion that the mint <name type="place">An-yang</name> of early knife coins must be the one located in present southeastern <name type="place">Shantung</name> for the reason that during the <name type="place">Chou</name> period towns outside of that province did not use the early type of knife coin. The <name type="place">An-yang</name> of the round-footed spades with three holes (Late Spade IV) is most likely the one located in present northern <name type="place">Honan</name> which was captured by Ch'in in 257 B. C., for this type of spade coins is probably of Ch'in origin. We can approach the tentative solution of the locations of Chung-tu and P'ing-yang by the same method.</p>
                  <p>Not all of the mint names which appear on the coins can be found in the literary sources. As a matter of fact, many cannot be. In such cases, to reduce our difficulties in locating the mints to a possible minimum, we may resort to the locations of the mountains, rivers, and other landmarks after which early settlements in <name type="place">China</name> were often named. For example, "<name type="pname">Chi-yin</name>," a mint name on some of the round coins of <name type="place">Chou</name>, is not found in the literature of this period. The meaning of the place name is "on the <hi rend="italic">yin</hi> side of the Chi." This means
<pb n="21"/>
that the town in question was located on the <hi rend="italic">yin</hi> side of either a mountain or a river by the name of Chi. In Chinese antiquity there was no mountain of this name, but one of the four most important rivers was so designated. It traversed the western part of present <name type="place">Shantung</name>. The <hi rend="italic">yin</hi> side of a river is its southern side, and therefore, the town in question must have been located on the southern side of the Chi River. Since this town was named <name type="pname">Chi-yin</name>, there may have been also a town named Chi-yang (meaning "on the northern side of the Chi River"). Luckily, a town by this name did exist during the <name type="place">Chou</name> time and is recorded in the contemporary literature.<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref> It was located northeast of modern <name type="pname">Lan-füng</name> in eastern <name type="place">Honan</name> (approx. 115E and 35N). Judging from their names, the towns of <name type="pname">Chi-yin</name> and Chi-yang may have been opposite to each other, or at least they must have been located in the same neighborhood. This assumption is confirmed by the location of a city also named <name type="pname">Chi-yin</name> in the third century B. C. It was the capital of a Han province of the same name. The city was located about a mile northeast of modern Ting-t'ao in southeastern <name type="place">Shantung</name>, and about thirty miles northeast of old Chi-yang. In all probability, the <name type="pname">Chi-yin</name> of Han may have been the <name type="pname">Chi-yin</name> of <name type="place">Chou</name>. Thus, by resorting to landmarks we can locate <name type="pname">Chi-yin</name> and other mints whose names, though not to be found in ancient literature, have a geographical origin.</p>
                  <p>In connection with the identification of mint names mention should be made of the practice among Chinese numismatists of regarding some single character legends on ancient coins as abbreviations for two character mint names. For instance, <hi rend="italic">mu</hi> has been considered an abbreviation for <hi rend="italic">Mu-mün, yang</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Kao-yang, li</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Kung-li, kung</hi> for <hi rend="italic">San-kung</hi>, etc. It is true that a mint name can be abbreviated for lack of space. The abbreviation of "<name type="pname">Chin-yang</name>" as "Chin" on a Small Knife is an example. It, however, can be proved, while those mentioned above cannot. Unless a claim of abbreviation can be proved, it must not be accepted without reserve.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A brief survey of the development of commerce in ancient <name type="place">China</name> seems necessary to provide a general background for our discussion of the origin and evolution of Chinese coinage, for there are no works, either in Chinese or other languages, which can be recommended for reference on this topic.</p>
               <p>According to an old myth, markets were established in prehistoric <name type="place">China</name> by a legendary hero, <name type="pname">Shün-nung</name>. It is idle speculation to consider the possibility of commerce at such a remote time, since its significance in the general economy could not have been any greater than that of barter trade among present day primitive peoples. It will be more profitable to study the economic conditions under the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty, for which period there is a fair amount of archaeological devience.</p>
               <pb n="23"/>
               <p>Some scholars have asserted that the <name type="place">Shang</name> economy was based either on cattle-breeding or on a combination of cattle-breeding and rudimentary agriculture. Others would have us believe that the <name type="place">Shang</name> people lived in an even more primitive state. However, study of oracle bone inscriptions has proved rather the contrary.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> By conquest and colonization the <name type="place">Shang</name> had built up a large empire. During the last two hundred and fifty years of their history, which ends in 1122 B. C. according to the traditional chronology, their territory extended to the sea in the east, to central <name type="place">Shensi</name> in the west, to southern Hopeh in the north, and to the banks of the Huai River in the south.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> The people of this empire led a life which was predominantly agricultural.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> Recently a Chinese scholar suggested the possibility that ploughs
<pb n="24"/>
pulled by oxen were used to till the fields and that bronze ploughshares were known.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> These ideas are challenging, even though there is no positive evidence to prove them.</p>
               <p>In his campaign against the "<name type="pname">Kuei-fang</name>" state, northwest of the <name type="place">Shang</name> kingdom in modern Shansi province, King <name type="pname">Wu-ting</name> called to arms 23,000 of his subjects in a period of three months.<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref> In one of his expeditions against the Ch'iang people in the west, he conscripted 10,000 on a single day together with 3000 more from a vassal state.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Conscriptions on such a scale could not have been possible unless there had been a fairly large population, and the existence of a large population presupposes a developed economic production, at least in agriculture.</p>
               <p>In handicrafts the <name type="place">Shang</name> people achieved exceptional skill and great delicacy of aesthetic taste, as is widely demonstrated in their beautiful bronzes. Their skill in casting finds no match in later periods of Chinese history.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> The excellence of their workmanship has caused Creel to claim that it can barely be surpassed by today's metal worker with modern science and technology at his command,<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> and that it has seldom been attained "anywhere in human history."<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> Creel's opinions
<pb n="25"/>
may be accented with enthusiasm, but they testify to the high quality of the products of Shang craftsmen. Such a degree of technical accomplishment could have been attained only through specialization, which in turn, could result only from division of labor. The presence of these two factors, specialization and division of labor, precludes the possibility that each family unit was economically self-sufficient. It obviously points to the existence of an economy based, at least partly, on exchange.</p>
               <p>The economy of the state as a whole showed a similar dependence on products of other regions. The basic metals, copper and tin, which were used in the manufacture of weapons, sacrificial vessels, and many other utensils, were not to be found within the boundaries of the kingdom. They had to be obtained from the south, in and beyond the Yangtze Valley.<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> The same was true of gold, silver and cowrie shells,<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> which last were used both for ornaments and as media of exchange. Their red pigment, known as cinnabar, came from Shu (modern <name type="place">western Szechuan</name>) and their jade was imported from western regions far beyond the <name type="place">Shang</name> borders.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> Most of the tortoise shells,
<pb n="26"/>
which were highly prized and served for divination, were of non-local origin; some of the larger specimens may have come from as far away as Malaya.<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It is very likely that the <name type="place">Shang</name> kings obtained a good part of these imported products as tribute from southern states subject to them, or as booty. As the amount obtainable from such sources could not have satisfied the demands of both the court and the people, a certain proportion of the products must have been acquired through exchange.</p>
               <p>The mutual dependence of the various regions within the kingdom was even more evident.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> Take salt for example. There were probably
<pb n="27"/>
only two sources for this commodity. One was lake salt from present southwestern Shansi and the other sea salt from the east coast. At the present time there are no other areas within the limits of the <name type="place">Shang</name> dominion which produce salt in any quantity, and it is probable that there was none in ancient times. In addition to salt there were no doubt other necessities of daily life which were specialties of particular regions also.</p>
               <p>Due to lack of archaeological or literary evidence we are ignorant of the extent of exchange in this early period. We can, though, conclude with confidence that commerce had reached an active stage. Since Han times the word <name type="place">
                     <hi rend="italic">shang</hi>
                  </name> has been used to designate "trade." The explanation of Han scholars that <name type="place">
                     <hi rend="italic">shang</hi>
                  </name> (i. e., tradesmen) refers to traders who travel long distances is a rationalized interpretation of the word rather than an exposition of its original meaning. Recent research has shown that the character "shang" was used in ancient <name type="place">China</name> only to denote the dynasty, the people, or their capital. Hence, Hsü Chung-shu identifies the term <hi rend="italic">shang-jün</hi> in the sense of "tradesmen" with <hi rend="italic">shang-jün</hi> meaning "people of Shang."<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> In his opinion, after their conquest by the <name type="place">Chou</name>, the <name type="place">Shang</name> people found themselves relegated to an inferior position, which circumstance forced many of them to take up trading, an occupation deemed degrading by the upper classes. Hsü draws a parallel between the <name type="place">Shang</name> people and the Jews, both being peoples forced by circumstance into trade as their special profession. While he may be correct in this conjecture, it is equally possible and even more plausible that the identification by the <name type="place">Chou</name> of <name type="place">Shang</name> natives with tradesmen took place a few centuries
<pb n="28"/>
earlier when the Shang, at the peak of their prosperity, came to the more backward <name type="place">Chou</name> to exchange their own products for those of the tribes of the west. Assuming this as true, it would be only natural for the <name type="place">Chou</name> to identify trading as an outstanding characteristic of the Shang.<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> If this interpretation is plausible, we may venture that a group of professional merchants existed in the <name type="place">Shang</name> state whose business extended well beyond their own borders.</p>
               <p>That the <name type="place">Shang</name> people had engaged in widespread trade can be inferred from a statement in "<name type="pname">Chiu kao</name>," a decree issued by King <name type="pname">Wu</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref> the founder of the <name type="place">Chou</name> dynasty, ordering the vanquished <name type="place">Shang</name> of the "Mei State" to cease their overindulgence in wine and to devote themselves to farming and trade. The decree says, "You should, working hard, take your carriages and oxen and pursue trade over long distances so that you can filially nurture your fathers and mothers."<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A statement of Confucius indicates that the <name type="place">Chou</name> people, who possessed a cruder culture, absorbed the <name type="place">Shang</name> civilization after its conquest.<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> This is corroborated by both archaeological and literary evidence. In the economic sphere, likewise, they must have inherited the pattern of the people they conquered. Unfortunately, with the exception of a few inscriptions on early <name type="place">Chou</name> bronzes, we have practically no information on the economic life of the first two hundred years after the change of dynasties.</p>
               <p>For the later <name type="place">Chou</name> period, reference to trade is made in the Ode of Chan-yang which has been preserved in the <hi rend="italic">Shih ching</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Book of</hi>
                  <pb n="29"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Odes.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> This ode expresses grievances of the people against misconduct of government, interference in politics by women, and pursuit of trade by the nobility. A part of it runs:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Such things as trade yielding</l>
                  <l>three times (its capital),</l>
                  <l>A superior man should have</l>
                  <l>knowledge of.</l>
                  <l>A woman has nothing to do with</l>
                  <l>public affairs,</l>
                  <l>Yet she leaves her silkworms and weaving.<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>This is a description of behavior contrary to the accepted norm. It was considered degrading for a nobleman to engage in trade, but obviously the temptation of three hundred per cent profit was hard to resist.</p>
               <p>The woman referred to in the ode is said to have been Pao Ssǔ, first a court lady of King <name type="pname">Yu</name> (781—771 B. C.) who was made his queen when he ascended the throne. Through her influence, he is reported to have misruled his people and to have invited the Jung invasion which almost ended the <name type="place">Chou</name>. If this identification is correct, the ode must have originated in the eighth century B. C.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">2. THE CH'UN-CH'IU PERIOD (770—481 B. C.)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>In the early years of the eighth century B. C., <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> (806—771 B. C.) of the State of Chüng entered into a sworn agreement with the merchants in his territory. Such an event presupposes that a flourishing trade had become important enough to elevate greatly the social position of the merchant class. An account of this agreement was made by Chüng Tzǔ-ch'an, a member of the Chüng ruling family and the most famous statesman of Chüng, to a high minister from the state of Chin in 526 B. C.<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> According to Tzǔ-ch'an, when <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> moved from the west to the east and established his state in what is now central <name type="place">Honan</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> he concluded an agreement with the merchants who had helped him develop this new territory. Under the agreement the merchants promised not to rebel against the state, and <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> pledged himself not to compel the merchants to sell, nor to seize their merchandise by force, nor to inquire into their capital or profits. This account indicates that, as early as the end of the ninth and beginning of the eighth century B. C., the importance of merchants in Chüng had won the recognition of the state and had secured for them an official protection not previously enjoyed.</p>
               <p>The growing importance of commerce was even more manifest in the state of Ch'i, where the government itself engaged in trade. When <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> (not to be confused with the ruler of Chüng with the same title) assumed its rule in 685 B. C., Ch'i was a very small state on the lower stream of the Chi River, which formed its western boundary. Its eastern boundary was less than ten miles from its capital, Lin-tzǔ (also a modern city).<ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> However, the state was situated on the coast, where fish abounded and where salt could be easily produced from the sea. <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> (d. 645 B. C.), the <name type="pname">Duke's</name> chief minister, realized the potentialities of these natural economic resources. He formulated and put into practice his policy of "creating profits through [the
<pb n="31"/>
production and sale of] fish and salt."<ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> In co-ordination with this policy he devised a means of market control through regulation of supply and demand.<ref target="#CH2-n26">26</ref> By putting these measures into effect <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> in a short time raised the "tiny Ch'i" to a position of hegemony within the <name type="place">Chou</name> empire. As a reward to <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name>, <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> granted to him the revenue from taxes on trade.<ref target="#CH2-n27">27</ref> His benefit from this revenue made <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name>, the minister of a feudal lord, "wealthier than the ruler of a state."<ref target="#CH2-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The salt and fishing industries from which Ch'i of the seventh century B. C. derived so much power had, of course, developed long before this date. Likewise, there must have been an earlier export trade in fish and salt already developed which <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> and <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> promoted and expanded with such great success. Evidence for this is found in the early history of Ch'i as related by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien in his <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref> The historian states that when T'ai-kung Wang, the
<pb n="32"/>
first ancestor of the house of Ch'i, was enfeoffed and granted Ying-ch'iu, a town in Ch'i, he found that its soil was alkaline and its population small. Therefore, he "promoted its silk textile industry, perfected its skillful handicrafts, an dopened up [production and trade in] fish and salt."<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref> As a result, "both people and goods came to it [the town of Ch'i]. They arrived carrying babies on their backs and converged on it like the spokes of a wheel. Consequently, Ch'i provided the world with hats, sashes, clothes and slippers."<ref target="#CH2-n31">31</ref> Although the enfeudation of T'ai-kung Wang with Ch'i has been proven untrue, the remainder of the account may contain elements of truth.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref> If so, Ch'i must have been an industrial center in ancient <name type="place">China</name> for a long period with exports not only of sea products but also of handicrafts, particularly silks, which are mentioned by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien elsewhere.<ref target="#CH2-n33">33</ref> Its immediate
<pb n="33"/>
markets were the territories of Liang (Wei), Chao,<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref> Sung and Wei, according to <hi rend="italic">Kuan-tzǔ</hi>.<ref target="#CH2-n35">35</ref> Corroboration of the great demand for the sea produce of Ch'i and of its eastern neighbor, Lai, is found in the gratitude of consumer states to <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> when he abolished custom tolls and promoted direct purchases from Lai.<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Another fact which attests to early development of trade in Ch'i is the mention of "big merchants and hoarders"<ref target="#CH2-n37">37</ref> in conjunction with <name type="pname">Kuan Chung's</name> program for maintaining equilibrium of the market. <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> proposed to regulate trade and prevent market manipulation by storing ample stocks of grain in times of plenty for release in times of scarcity.<ref target="#CH2-n38">38</ref> His plan was called "well conceived and well adapted to problems of scarcity and oversupply."<ref target="#CH2-n39">39</ref> The regulation of the market reveals two significant points: trade played an essential part in Ch'i's economy and "big merchants and hoarders" had appeared who manipulated the market and "forcefully exploited the people."<ref target="#CH2-n40">40</ref> Even if we grant a measure of discount to the account of
<pb n="34"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Kuan-tzǔ</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH2-n41">41</ref>, the fact remains that trade had developed to an advanced stage in the Ch'i economy.<ref target="#CH2-n42">42</ref>
               </p>
               <p>We have evidence that by the middle of the seventh century B. C., and possibly earlier, economic needs had transcended state boundaries and that political divisions proved a hindrance to normal exchange. In 651 B. C. a conference of feudal lords convened at K'uei-ch'iu where <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> of Ch'i demanded that the participants henceforth "shall not hoard grain" and "shall not curtail (the export of) raw materials."<ref target="#CH2-n43">43</ref> Because of its alkaline soil Ch'i was unable to support its entire population and the large army it required to maintain its hegemony. It is also probable that its handicraft industries needed raw materials from other areas. These were the reasons, no doubt, for the demands of the <name type="pname">Duke</name>. Another treaty drawn up in 562 B. C. practically repeats the provisions of the earlier one. In it the agreeing parties promise "not to hoard grain in bad years" and "not to block (the flow) of products."<ref target="#CH2-n44">44</ref>
               </p>
               <p>An early development of industry and commerce can be traced also in the state of Wei. In 658 B. C., the year after the state was invaded by the Ti people, Duke Wün moved his capital eastwards to Ch'u-ch'iu on the northern border of the present <name type="place">Honan</name> province. There he pursued a program of reconstruction by "promoting commerce and favoring industry." As a result, the population of <name type="place">Wei</name> increased threefold in a period of twenty-three years.<ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref> More than a century later, when Confucius visited the state he was greatly impressed with its flourishing condition.<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="35"/>
               <p>Geographically speaking, <name type="place">Wei</name> was situated at that time in the center of ancient <name type="place">China</name>, in the plain at the middle of the old Yellow River valley, and on the <hi rend="italic">Wu-tao</hi> (cross-roads).<ref target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> During the Ch'un-ch'iu period, Wei, capital of the state, was one of the three cities renowned for their riches, the other two being Lin-tzǔ, capital of Ch'i, and T'ao. It has on several occasions been mentioned together with T'ao as a place abounding in wealth.<ref target="#CH2-n48">48</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Across the northern and western borders of <name type="place">Wei</name> we enter the territory of the state of Chin. Although it lagged behind Ch'i and Wei, there are signs of an early development of commerce there. <name type="pname">Duke Wün</name> (636—628 B. C.) of Chin, the first of its rulers to bring the state to a position of power, realized the benefits of trade and promoted it for the benefit of both the state and its people. On assumption of rule in 636 B. C., he "reduced duties at the passes, flattened the roads, opened up commerce, and lessened the burdens of the peasants ... in order to better the life of the people."<ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> As a result, in the middle of the sixth century B. C. we find that "the rich merchants of Chiang (capital of Chin) ... could decorate their carriages with gold and jade and have their clothing embroidered with flowery patterns."<ref target="#CH2-n50">50</ref> "They could," furthermore, "(befriend and) distribute gifts to the feudal lords."<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> These words of Shu-hsiang, the grand tutor, to Han Hsüantzǔ, chief minister of state, give a good picture of the amount of wealth that merchants had accumulated in this state. From the degree of their prosperity we can easily infer the state of development of trade. As an ancient folk saying put it, "The longer the sleeves, the better the dancer dances; the wealthier the merchant, the more successfuly he trades."<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="36"/>
               <p>As a result of increased development in the seventh century B. C., trade was recognized to be as essential as agriculture and industry. A simultaneous and balanced development of the three became a criterion by which the strength of a state was judged. In 597 B. C., when Chin was preparing an attack on Ch'u, Sui-wu-tzǔ dissuaded Duke Li of Chin from acting, for as he observed, in Ch'u "neither the merchants, the farmers, nor the artisans have shown any relaxation in production."<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> In 564, when Ch'u consented to join forces with Ch'in against Chin, Tzǔ-nang, a Ch'u minister, opposed the move, giving practically the identical reason.<ref target="#CH2-n54">54</ref> When, in 516 B. C., Duke Ching of Ch'i was concerned about the strength of his state, his minister Yen-tzǔ (named Ying), suggested that <hi rend="italic">li</hi> be put into practice. Along with a few other administrative measures his <hi rend="italic">li</hi> (proper principles for government) provided that "farmers do not shift their occupations, artisans and merchants do not change their professions. "<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Why did the ancient Chinese rulers consider the balance between trade, agriculture, and industry important? The <hi rend="italic">Chou shu</hi> (Book of <name type="place">Chou</name>) says, "If the farmers do not produce, there will be a shortage of food. If foresters do not produce, some works will not be accomplished. If the merchants do not produce, the sources of wealth will be cut."<ref target="#CH2-n56">56</ref> Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien remarks, "From the farmers food is obtained, by the foresters the materials are produced by which the artisans' goods are manufactured, by the merchants they are circulated."<ref target="#CH2-n57">57</ref> "These four," he continues, "are the sources for clothes and food for the people. If the sources are great, abundance will result; if the sources are small, scarcity will result. They enrich the state above, and enrich the people below."<ref target="#CH2-n58">58</ref>
               </p>
               <p>One way in which the state reaped direct benefit from commerce was through collection of taxes on market transactions and of customs duties at passes (<hi rend="italic">kuan</hi>). To supervise markets and probably to collect taxes therein special officials were appointed. They were called <hi rend="italic">ku-Chüng</hi> (director of trade) in Lu,<ref target="#CH2-n59">59</ref>
                  <hi rend="italic">ch'u-shih</hi> (market supervisor)
<pb n="37"/>
in Chüng,<ref target="#CH2-n60">60</ref>
                  <hi rend="italic">shih-ling</hi> (market prefect) and <hi rend="italic">shih-yüan</hi> (assistant to market prefect) in <hi rend="italic">Ch'i</hi>,<ref target="#CH2-n61">61</ref>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ssǔ-shih</hi> (director of the market) and <hi rend="italic">ku-shih</hi> (trade supervisor) in the <hi rend="italic">Chou li</hi>.<ref target="#CH2-n62">62</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Frontier passes (<hi rend="italic">kuan</hi>) as strategic points through which invaders might enter were originally the sites of military outposts. It was only after the volume of interstate trade had become substantial that they became also collection points of customs duties. The <hi rend="italic">Kuan-tzǔ</hi> defines a pass as "a feudal lord's strategic road and the door for outside wealth."<ref target="#CH2-n63">63</ref> As soon as feudal rulers realized the large amount of revenue they were reaping from duty collections at frontier passes, greed inevitably led them to set up <hi rend="italic">kuan</hi> for collection of duties within their interiors. Some states like Ch'i extended duty collections to points close to the walls of their capitals. In 522 B. C. Yen-tzǔ stated that "the passes [customs stations] close to the capital [of Ch'i] tyrannically collect duties for personal profit,"<ref target="#CH2-n64">64</ref> that is, of the prince of Ch'i. One hundred and three years before (in 625 B. C.) the state of Lu had set up six additional such customs offices. Confucius referred to their establishment as one of the three inhuman acts performed by the Lu minister, Tsang Wün-chung,<ref target="#CH2-n65">65</ref> The phraseology of Confucius gives the impression that these customs stations were in the interior. The whole practice of customs collections was bitterly denounced by Mencius: "In ancient times the erection of customs stations was directed against tyranny [meaning agression]; at the present [fourth century B. C.] the erection of customs stations is for exercising tyranny."<ref target="#CH2-n66">66</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="38"/>
               <p>The above data concerning the establishment of stations for collection of duties throw considerable light on the development of commerce. The lack of concrete figures or even general statements regarding the amount of revenue collected at a customs station makes it impossible to estimate the volume of trade. A portion of the <hi rend="italic">Tso chuan</hi>, however, does enable us to gauge its value. The author of the <hi rend="italic">Tso chuan</hi> relates that the Ti people invaded Sung during the reign of Duke Wu (766—749 B. C.). In the battle with the invaders all the Sung generals perished except Erh-pan, whose chariot led the defense's charge. To reward him, 'The Duke granted a customs station to Erh-pan as his fief and let him live on its collections."<ref target="#CH2-n67">67</ref> That the collection of duties was granted as a reward or fief to a victorious warrior indicates that this source of revenue had become sizeable and fairly regular. Even more significant is the fact that Erh-pan's grant took place in the middle of the eighth century, almost a hundred years before the commercial policies of <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> of Ch'i and <name type="pname">Duke Wün</name> of <name type="place">Wei</name> were adopted.</p>
               <p>The development of trade and the large profits accruing to those engaged in it would naturally bring merchants out of relative obscurity into activity in public affairs. The names of a few merchants before the fifth century B. C. are mentioned in extant historical literature in connection with important events. Primary among these are the names of Pao Shu-ya and <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name>, whom we have already mentioned as the advisor of <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> of Ch'i.</p>
               <p>Before his rise to prominence, or in his own words "when I was in a difficult situation," <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> had been a merchant, originally from Ying-shang<ref target="#CH2-n68">68</ref> (in what is now Central <name type="place">Honan</name>), trading in Nan-yang,<ref target="#CH2-n69">69</ref> a large city in the southwestern part of the province. For sometime he had been a business associate of Pao Shu-ya,<ref target="#CH2-n70">70</ref> who likewise rose to high position in the ruling circle of Ch'i. It was, in fact, Pao Shu-ya who recommended <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> to <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name>. Both
<pb n="39"/>
Pao Shu-ya and <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> became high officials in the state. The latter was honored by <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> with the title <hi rend="italic">chung-fu</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH2-n71">71</ref> and Confucius paid tribute to him for having saved the Chinese from conquest by barbarians.<ref target="#CH2-n72">72</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Next we find the name of Hsüan Kao, a merchant of Chüng.<ref target="#CH2-n73">73</ref> In 627 B. C., when driving his herds of cattle to the city of <name type="place">Chou</name> to market them, Hsüan Kao met the armies of Ch'in marching eastward to make a surprise attack on his home state. Sensing the danger, he pretended he was an official emissary sent by Chüng to welcome and feast the invading troops. While entertaining them he secretly dispatched warning and thereby saved his state.<ref target="#CH2-n74">74</ref>
               </p>
               <p>From Chüng there was another merchant, whose identity is unknown. In 568 B. C., an important general of Chin, Hsün Ying, was captured by the enemy in the course of a battle with the army of Ch'u. Partisans of the general asked a merchant, who had come to Ch'u on business, for help in an escape plot. The merchant agreed and worked out a plan for smuggling the general out among his merchandise. Although Hsün Ying was released before the plot was carried out, he was nonetheless so grateful that when the merchant came to Chin to trade he offered him special favors. Declining the general's generosity, the merchant went on to Ch'i in pursuance of his business.<ref target="#CH2-n75">75</ref> Obviously this merchant must have been prominent and one with social connections among important personages in both Ch'u and Chin. To warrant such extensive travelling in Chüng, Ch'u, Chin and Ch'i, practically all over the then known Chinese world, his business must have been on a large scale.</p>
               <p>Of all the big merchants of this period the most famous was Tuan-mu Ssǔ, a disciple of Confucius, better known as Tzǔ-kung. Tzǔ-kung, a native of <name type="place">Wei</name> which had long prospered through trade, is said to
<pb n="40"/>
have been a master of market manipulation. "He hoarded merchandise or released it according to the prospects of making profit,"<ref target="#CH2-n76">76</ref> and thereby acquired a great fortune. Although Confucius reproached him for his interest in trade and for his lack of it in studies, he praised his ability in commercial speculation.<ref target="#CH2-n77">77</ref> Tzǔ-kung's wealth enabled him to travel from one princely court to another accompanied by a long retinue of horses and carriages laden with fine silks of which he made gifts to the feudal princes. Wherever he went, rulers accorded him the courteous treatment of an equal.<ref target="#CH2-n78">78</ref> In the opinion of Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien, the great historian, it was Tzǔ-kung who "made the name of Confucius popular over the world."<ref target="#CH2-n79">79</ref> Even though he may not have done so consciously, Tzǔ-kung, as both the favorite disciple of Confucius and a prominent merchant, must have publicized his teacher widely. Moreover, he was not only a business man renowned for his wealth, but was an influential politician as well. While a trader he served Lu and <name type="place">Wei</name> in various official capacities.<ref target="#CH2-n80">80</ref> His last years were spent in Ch'i, the state most famous for its industry and commerce.</p>
               <p>Another personage reported to have come to Ch'i was the famous statesman Fan Li, who had aided the king of Yüeh (modern Chekiang) to conquer Wu (southern <name type="place">Kiangsu</name>), to extend the state's territory to the borders of Lu and Ch'i, and thus to attain a political position on a par with the central states. This was in the first half of the fifth century B. C. According to the account, after Yüeh had attained its greatest power, Fan Li resigned, changed his name, went to Ch'i, and later established himself as a business man in T'ao, which city was regarded as the geographical center of the empire. Henceforth, Fan Li became known as T'ao Chu-kung (Old Gentleman Chu of T'ao). The fortune he made from trade profits and interest on money-lending became so great that he became a symbol of wealth<ref target="#CH2-n81">81</ref> and served as a model to Chinese businessmen from that day to the present. Though
<pb n="41"/>
the identification of Chu-Kung with Fan Li seems open to doubt<ref target="#CH2-n82">82</ref> the historical character of the Old Gentleman Chu remains.</p>
               <p>Like the Old Gentleman Chu of T'ao, Po Kuei also achieved great success in trade and gained even greater fame. He was a native of <name type="place">Chou</name>, an area which was highly commercialized. Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien says that he lived in the time of Marquis Wün (446—397 B. C.) of Wei, but some modern scholars believe he lived a century later.<ref target="#CH2-n83">83</ref> According to Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien he "was very successful in predicting the trend of the time." Hoarding merchandise which would bring him large returns, he purchased when others dumped, and vice versa. "In grasping the advantages of the moment, he acted as ferocious animals and vultures do in falling on their prey."<ref target="#CH2-n84">84</ref> He boasted that he conducted his business in the manner I Yin and Lü <name type="place">Shang</name> (statesmen of an earlier time) laid out their administrative policies, Sun Pin and Wu Ch'i (famous military strategists) commanded their armies, and <name type="place">Shang</name> Yang (a reformist statesman) executed his orders.<ref target="#CH2-n85">85</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The above accounts of early Chinese merchants are not to be read as biographical notes only, for in them we find data upon which a clearer picture of early commerce in <name type="place">China</name> can be reconstructed. Fragmentary as the information is, it all points to a considerable development of trade in this period. Let us summarize our findings. As far back as the early part of the eighth century B. C. the contribution of commerce to general economic life had won the attention of the ruling authorities. Around the middle of that century custom duties collections, at least in Sung, had reached considerable proportions. In the following century Ch'i and <name type="place">Wei</name> successively pursued programs of commercial expansion. The lucrative profits of trade attracted many to take it up as an occupation even though it had been considered an ignoble one. Merchants travelled throughout the
<pb n="42"/>
the world then known to the Chinese and amassed such fortunes that nobles accepted them as equals and appointed them to high administrative positions in their governments.</p>

                  <p>The term for the market tax is <hi rend="italic">san-kuei</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_031a.jpg"/> When Confucius was asked whether <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> was frugal, he said he was not because <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> "had the <hi rend="italic">san-kuei.</hi>" (<hi rend="italic">Lun-yü</hi>, III, 5b). In the <hi rend="italic">Han-fei-tzǔ</hi> it is said after <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> became the chief minister of <name type="pname">Duke Huan</name> of Ch'i, the latter bestowed upon him the <hi rend="italic">san-kuei</hi> in order to enrich him. (1875, XII, 11a). As the term was obscure to later scholars, it has been interpreted as meaning "the name of a terrace" or "wives from three different families." Kuo Sung-t'ao <graphic url="NNM122_031b.jpg"/> (1818 —1891) rejects these explanations and suggests that it was a general term applied to market taxation, meaning thirty per cent of the profit. See his <hi rend="italic">Yang-chih shu-wu wün-chi</hi> (A collection of writings of the Yang-chih Study), I, "Shih san-kuei" (Interpretation of <hi rend="italic">San-kuei).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Kuo Sung-t'ao's interpretation appears most satisfactory. The <hi rend="italic">san-kuei</hi> grant to <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> as recorded by <name type="pname">Liu Hsiang</name>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_031c.jpg"/> (77 —6 B. C.) is "one year's tax from the market of the Ch'i state." <hi rend="italic">(Shuo-yüan, Ssǔ-pu pei-yao</hi> ed., VIII, 12a).

                  <p>The story quoted below in the text concerns the enfeudation of Lü Wang <graphic url="NNM122_031d.jpg"/> or T'ai-kung Wang (the first ancestor Wang) with Ying-ch'iu <graphic url="NNM122_031e.jpg"/> a town in the ancient Ch'i state, as his fief. It tells how Lü Wang established his state in Ch'i and developed its economic resources. The story does not correspond with the historical facts. As has been ably disproved by Prof. Fu Ssǔ-nien, at the time when Lü Wang was supposed to have been made the feudal lord of Ch'i, the territory which later came to be known as Ch'i was still in the hands of the <name type="place">Shang</name> people or their vassals. The very name of the beneficiary, Lü Wang or Wang of Lü, indicates strongly that the fief of Wang was Lü, not Ch'i. Even a generation later, his son Chi <graphic url="NNM122_031f.jpg"/> was still called Lü Chi or Chi of Lü. Prof. <name type="pname">Fu's</name> arguments are contained in his article "On Ta-Tung and Hsiao-Tung," <hi rend="italic">Bulletin of the National Research Institute of History and Philology</hi>, Academia Sinica, II (1930), 101 —109. What immediately concerns us here is not the authenticity of the enfeudation of Lü Wang in Ch'i but the possibility of the early development of industry and commerce in the region of Ch'i, which is the main point of the story.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The Chan-kuo Period (403—221 B. C.) witnessed a further development of commerce. The civil wars regarded as characteristic of the period (Chan-kuo means "warring states") in actuality surpassed very little those of earlier times in either frequency or destructiveness. They certainly do not appear to have hindered the growth of trade.</p>
               <p>It is significant that the agrarianist Hsü Hsing, a contemporary of Mencius (390—305 B. C.), advanced a political philosophy which aimed to eradicate the evils of the day by making a farmer of everyone. It is said that he and his disciples cultivated fields themselves and lived extremely simple lives so as to set an example for their teachings. Mencius disapproved of both their theory and their practice of it. Encountering a follower of Hsü Hsing he questioned him and learned that the philosopher had been unable to maintain himself without acquiring clothes, hats, utensils and iron implements from other people. As Mencius puts it Hsü Hsing was engaged in a "busy and confused" [i. e., 'complicated'] exchange with the hundred [i. e., 'many'] artisans for the goods [he needs]."<ref target="#CH2-n86">86</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the things which Hsü Hsing needed could be purchased in the locality (both he and Mencius lived in the state of T'üing at the time), such as simple pottery utensils. Some others, such as iron for making tools, could not be so obtained. Artisans who manufactured iron tools had to secure their metal from other areas.<ref target="#CH2-n87">87</ref> Many other
<pb n="43"/>
things were as necessary to life on an economically higher level as iron was to the ascetic. Timber, bamboo, <hi rend="italic">ku</hi> barks for writing material, <hi rend="italic">lu</hi> mountain hemp for making cloth, yak tails, jade and other precious stones from west of the mountains;<ref target="#CH2-n88">88</ref> fish, salt, lacquer, silk, musical instruments and embroideries<ref target="#CH2-n89">89</ref> from east of the mountains; wood of the <hi rend="italic">nan (Machilus nanmu)</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tzǔ (Lindera tzumu)</hi>, ginger, cinnamon trees, gold, tin, lead, cinnabar, rhinoceros (hide or horn), tortoise shells, pearls, ivory, and other hides from south of the Chiang (Yangtze River); horses, oxen, sheep, furs, sinews and horns from the north; and copper and iron from many other places<ref target="#CH2-n90">90</ref> — "all these," as Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien observes, "were what the people of the central kingdom<ref target="#CH2-n91">91</ref> enjoyed and the materials from which, according to the custom of the day, were made clothes, food and articles for nurturing the living and burying the dead."<ref target="#CH2-n92">92</ref>
               </p>
               <p>These commodities listed above are taken from the introduction of the section on merchants and manufactures in pre-Ch'in <name type="place">China</name> in
<pb n="44"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi> by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien. What he describes is but a general picture,<ref target="#CH2-n93">93</ref> and he does not pretend to give a complete enumeration. Besides these, jujubes from Yen (roughly modern Hopeh) and An-i (<name type="place">southern Shansi</name>), chestnuts from Yen and Ch'in (roughly <name type="place">Shensi</name>), fish and salt from Yen and Wu (southern <name type="place">Kiangsu</name>), copper from Wu, copper and iron from Pa and Shu (<name type="place">Szechuan</name>), fruits and cloth from Pan-yü (<name type="place">Canton</name>), oranges from Shu, Han and Chiang-ling (<name type="place">Szechuan</name> and southern Hupeh), etc., formed part of the merchandise which crowded many of the markets.<ref target="#CH2-n94">94</ref>

               <p>Flourishing trade brought about commercialization of a part of the agricultural produce. We find it stated that a cattle breeder who possessed 50 horses, 166 oxen, 250 sheep, and 250 pigs; a fish grower who produced 1000 piculs <hi rend="italic">(shih)</hi> in his ponds; an orchardist of 1000 jujube trees in An-i, or of 1000 chestnut trees in Yen or Ch'in, or of 1000 orange trees in Shu, Han or Chiang-ling; a grower of 100 ch'iu trees <hi rend="italic">(Mallotus japonicus)</hi> in the Yellow River valley, or of 1000 <hi rend="italic">mou</hi> (land measure) of lacquer trees in Ch'ün or Hsia (central and eastern <name type="place">Honan</name>), or of 1000 <hi rend="italic">mou</hi> of mulberry trees or hemp in Ch'i or Lu (<name type="place">Shantung</name>); or of 1000 fertile <hi rend="italic">mou</hi> of grain, or of 1000 <hi rend="italic">mou</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">chih</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> plants (from the flowers of which red and yellowish-red pigments were made), or of 1000 plots of ginger or leeks — that any one of them received a revenue equal to that of a marquis with a fief of one thousand households.<ref target="#CH2-n95">95</ref> Since a household paid an annual tribute of two hundred cash to its noble lord, this revenue in terms of cash would be 200,000. Calculated at the twenty per cent rate of profit accruing to the farmers, artisans and merchants of the time as recorded by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien, a profit of 200,000 represented, so to speak, a capital of one million.<ref target="#CH2-n96">96</ref> Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien therefore calls the man of such wealth a "noble without a fief."<ref target="#CH2-n97">97</ref>

               <p>Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien's record, being given in round numbers, cannot be taken as accurate in detail, nor can it be assumed that it is free from the exaggeration of over-enthusiasm. Nevertheless, the bulk of the statistics he gives, inaccurate though they may be, does reflect the large volume of business transactions in a sizeable city of that day. Again according to Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien, a merchant could reap a profit of fifty per cent, though some might make less.<ref target="#CH2-n99">99</ref> In pursuit of trade, the merchants came and departed in large noisy crowds.<ref target="#CH2-n100">100</ref> Profit from their trade was so great that Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien observed, "For a poor man seeking wealth, farming was not as good as handicrafts, and handicrafts not as good as trade; to embroider silk was not as good as to lean against a shop door."<ref target="#CH2-n101">101</ref> "Once a man became rich, all virtues

would attach to him."<ref target="#CH2-n102">102</ref> "Precedence was accorded to wealth, and propriety and modesty were not given highest attention."<ref target="#CH2-n103">103</ref>
               </p>
               <p>During this period, many opulent merchants seem to have arisen to considerable influence. In the middle of the third century B. C. Lü Pu-wei, an influential merchant from Yang-ti in the state of Han, interfered with the line of succession in Ch'in. Mainly through bribery he helped onto the throne both King Chuang-hsiang (249—247 B. C.) and later, King Chüng (246 B. C.), who unified <name type="place">China</name> and became known as its First Emperor (221—210 B. C.). Lü Pu-wei was appointed Chancellor (<hi rend="italic">ch'üng-hsiang)</hi> by King Chuang-hsiang, and received the title of Marquis of Wün-hsin carrying with it a fief of 10,000 households in Lo-yang. When King Chüng ascended the throne, he further honored him by making him the Chancellor of the State (<hi rend="italic">hsiang-kuo)</hi> and by calling him <hi rend="italic">chung-fu</hi>, meaning "next to his father." With his wealth he kept ten thousand slaves and three thousand "guests" ( clients in the sense given to the word in <name type="pname">Roman</name> history). Among his clients were a number of scholars who at his order composed the historically famous work, the <hi rend="italic">Lü-shih ch'un-ch'iu</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Lü lan</hi> (Book of the Lü).<ref target="#CH2-n104">104</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Another result of the development of trade during the Chan-kuo period was the rise of the "metropolitan centers" <hi rend="italic">(tu-hui).</hi> Upon them "the people from the four directions" converged, and from them merchandise flowed to distant corners of the continent of <name type="place">Asia</name>.</p>
               <p>In the royal domain of <name type="place">Chou</name>, Lo-yang was the commercial metropolis. The people of <name type="place">Chou</name> were well-known artisans and tradesmen, who received a return on their output, as Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien gives it, of twenty per cent profit.<ref target="#CH2-n105">105</ref> The rich boasted of their ability to go on business trips of long periods, and the poorer imitated the rich.<ref target="#CH2-n106">106</ref> Through them their metropolis traded with Ch'i and Lu in the east, with Liang (Wei) and Ch'u in the south.<ref target="#CH2-n107">107</ref> "Situated in the middle of Ch'i, Ch'in, Ch'u and Chao, it was (as if) on a street."<ref target="#CH2-n108">108</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="47"/>
               <p>In the territory of Ch'i, specifically "between the sea and Mount T'ai (in central <name type="place">Shantung</name>)," Lin-tzǔ was the trading center.<ref target="#CH2-n109">109</ref> Besides being the capital of the state of Ch'i, Lin-tzǔ was a commercial city with a long history and unmatched prosperity (see below p. 177). Through the four centuries until King Hsüan (319—301 B. C.) of Ch'i, Lin-tzǔ was perhaps the richest and most prosperous city in the world then known to the Chinese. As Su Ch'in described it to the King, "On the roads to Lin-tzǔ the wheels of carriages bump each other, and the shoulders of the people rub one another. Connected, the breasts of their coats form a curtain; lifted, their sleeves form a tent; swept, their sweat makes rain."<ref target="#CH2-n110">110</ref> It was an emporium of salt, fish, and various silk fabrics.<ref target="#CH2-n111">111</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The metropolitan center in the northeastern part of ancient <name type="place">China</name> was Chi, capital of the state of Yen. It was economically connected with Ch'i and Chao in the south, and traded with the barbarian peoples to its north and east beyond the Chinese borders.<ref target="#CH2-n112">112</ref> It provided the interior of ancient <name type="place">China</name> with animal furs, sinews, horns, and horses.</p>
               <p>In Chao, the commercial center was Han-tan. It was the state's capital, a center of iron production and many other skillful handicrafts, and an economic pivot for the regions between the Chang and the Yellow River valleys. Its merchants frequented Chi and Cho in Yen in the north and the areas of Chüng and <name type="place">Wei</name> in the south.<ref target="#CH2-n113">113</ref> Though Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien does not so state, there certainly must have been constant visitors on business from Ch'i in the east and from the regions beyond the T'ai-hang mountain range in the northwest. Yang and P'ing-yang, cities in the Fün River valley in central Shansi, were also points of trade. They were the hubs for trade with Ch'in and the Ti barbarians in the west and with Chung and Tai in the north.<ref target="#CH2-n114">114</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="48"/>
               <p>Similarly, Wün and Chih constituted the commercial centers south of the T'ai-hang Mountains and north of the Yellow River in present day northwestern <name type="place">Honan</name>. These two cities traded with Shang-tang in the west and with Chung-shan in the state of Chao, in which localities the land was not fertile and the population so large that large numbers were forced to take up trade or skilled handicrafts to earn their living.<ref target="#CH2-n115">115</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Kuan-chung in modern central <name type="place">Shensi</name> was another important economic area, in which Li-i, replete with "big merchants," served as a commercial center in northwestern <name type="place">China</name>. It supplied the east with the goods from the non-Chinese peoples in the north and the west. To the south it controlled the merchandising of the special products of Pa and Shu (modern <name type="place">Szechuan</name>): the <hi rend="italic">chih</hi> deep red pigment, ginger, cinnabar, precious stones, copper, iron, and utensils made of bamboo and wood, and monopolized the importation of the slaves from P'o, an area neighboring Pa and Shu in their south. It also had access to the horses and yaks of the barbarians beyond the southwestern Chinese border.<ref target="#CH2-n116">116</ref>
               </p>
               <p>After the Yangtze River emerged from the gorges on the eastern border of Pa, the first big city on its banks was Ying (modern Chiangling), the capital of Ch'u. Ch'u was famous for its economic resources from the Yün-müng,<ref target="#CH2-n117">117</ref> an extensive area which, according to Wang-sun Wei, a Ch'u minister, produced metal (gold), lumber, bamboos, tortoises, pearls, furs (of wild animals), hides (of rhinoceros), feathers, and (yak) tails.<ref target="#CH2-n118">118</ref> In the lower Yangtze (called Chiang at that time) Valley, we find the city of Wu, still known today by its old name, which Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien calls "the metropolitan center east of the Chiang." The salt from the sea, the copper from the Chang-shan mountains, and the products from the many rivers and lakes of this area constituted the main merchandise of this city for export.<ref target="#CH2-n119">119</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="49"/>
               <p>The center north of the Huai River was Shou-ch'un, the last capital of the Ch'u. It lay at the juncture of communication routes between the Yangtze Valley and the Yellow River Valley. It was an emporium for animal hides and timber<ref target="#CH2-n120">120</ref> as well as many other southern products destined for the northern regions.</p>
               <p>In ancient times the region between the Huai and the Yellow Rivers corresponding to what is now <name type="place">northern Kiangsu</name>, eastern <name type="place">Honan</name>, <name type="place">northern Anhui</name> and southern <name type="place">Shantung</name>, was traversed by a number of small streams and artificial canals. The most important of the canals was the Hung Kou or the Great Canal. The date of its construction is not exactly known. The description of the Great Canal in the treatise on rivers by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien immediately follows the legend of Yü, who was said to have ended the Great Flood by opening nine water-ways in the lower valley of the Yellow River, and precedes the account of the construction of the canals of the Ch'un-ch'iu period (770—481 B. C.). At the latest, the canal appears to have been in existence before the fifth century B. C. Its starting point was in Ying-Yang (same as the modern district of the same name in central <name type="place">Honan</name>) where it connected with the Yellow River. It ran eastwards parallel with the present Lunghai Railway, passed Liang (modern Kaifeng), capital of Liang (Wei), then turned its course southeastwards, and joined the tributaries of the Huai River in modern northwest Anhui.<ref target="#CH2-n121">121</ref> As Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien sees it, the construction of the canal "was to open the way to and connect the states of Sung, Chüng, Ch'ün, Ts'ai, Ts'ao, and Wei, and to join the Chi, the Ju, the Huai, and the Ssǔ Rivers."<ref target="#CH2-n122">122</ref> These states covered a large area of ancient east central <name type="place">China</name>, corresponding to what is today northern <name type="place">Honan</name>, southern Hopeh, southwestern <name type="place">Shantung</name>, central and eastern <name type="place">Honan</name>, northwestern
<pb n="50"/>
Anhui, and <name type="place">northern Kiangsu</name>. The four rivers mentioned were the main streams of eastern and southeastern <name type="place">China</name> in ancient times.</p>
               <p>Another canal whose importance in the economic life as well as in the political struggles of this period was the Han Kou or the Han Canal. This canal was constructed in 486 B. C. by the state of Wu.<ref target="#CH2-n123">123</ref> It drew its water from the Chiang (Yangtze River) below the city of Chiang-tu, an historical commercial center. It followed a northward course and joined the Shü-yang Lake in modern central <name type="place">Kiangsu</name>. Emerging from the lake it continued its northward course and joined the Huai River in the area of modern Huai-an. In the Huai-an area it was also connected with the I River which flowed into southern <name type="place">Shantung</name> and the Ssǔ River which ran to the northwest and met the Chi River.<ref target="#CH2-n124">124</ref> When the <name type="place">Sui dynasty</name> (589—617 A. D.) constructed the Grand Canal, which was to prove so valuable to later dynasties for transportation of rice from the south, it made use of the original course of the Han Canal for the middle of the present Grand Canal course.</p>
               <p>Thus we see that during the later part of the <name type="place">Chou</name> dynasty, the great plain north of the Yangtze, south of Mount T'ai (in central <name type="place">Shantung</name>), west of Lo-yang, capital of <name type="place">Chou</name>, extending as far as the sea, traversed by many water ways, had become an economic whole, in spite of political boundaries. In the heart of the water communication system were situated the states of Sung with its capital Shang-ch'iu located on the site of its modern namesake in eastern <name type="place">Honan</name>, and later P'üng-ch'üng which was what is now the city of T'ung-shan or SuChou in <name type="place">northern Kiangsu</name>, and Liang with its capital Ta-Liang located on the Great Canal itself. Keeping in mind the strategical location which Sung occupied we will easily and fully understand the reason why during the Ch'un-ch'iu period this small state became a prey of Chin, Ch'u and other powers. We will also easily understand how the newly created state of Liang, relying on its strategic position,
<pb n="51"/>
could maintain a hegemony for almost a century from 425 to 334 B. C.<ref target="#CH2-n125">125</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In this great plain knit by the well laid water-ways of communication and teeming with commercial activities there were a few cities which may be regarded as "metropolitan centers" in the sense of the word as Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien uses it. But the most famous of them all was T'ao, where the Old Gentleman Chu made his fortune. The city, located in modern Ting-t'ao County in southwestern <name type="place">Shantung</name>, was on the bank of the ancient Southern Chi River. It was situated midway between Lin-tzǔ, Lo-yang, Han-tan and Shou-ch'un — four great metropolises which we have described above. By land route it was within easy access to Han-tan. By the Chi River it could reach both Lin-tzǔ<ref target="#CH2-n126">126</ref> and Lo-yang. The Great Canal and the Chi River connected it with Shou-ch'un. It was on the <hi rend="italic">Wu-tao</hi> (cross-road) of ancient <name type="place">China</name>
                  <ref target="#CH2-n127">127</ref> and regarded as the richest place which could be matched only by Wei.<ref target="#CH2-n128">128</ref> It was, as Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien puts it, "the center
<pb n="52"/>
of the world, from where all the feudal states could be reached and where merchandise was bought and sold."<ref target="#CH2-n129">129</ref> Hence it was coveted by all the warring states. In 386 B. C. the Chao state moved its capital to Han-tan, and in 362 B. C. Liang moved its capital to Ta-Liang. The action of both states was aimed at the struggle for the "Cross-road" and the area around the metropolis of T'ao. When the state of Ch'in embarked on its conquest of the rest of the Chou empire it first cut a long corridor through the territories of Han and Liang and took T'ao before 291 B. C., seventy years before it accomplished the conquest. The occupation of T'ao, the economic center and strategic point of the day, must have contributed much to the unification of ancient <name type="place">China</name> by Ch'in in the following decades.</p>
               <p>The rise of T'ao and the importance of the "Cross-road" were direct results of the commercial development during the Chan-kuo period. The economic forces of trade also created other metropolises, which served as focal points for their respective regions and helped bring about political unification.</p>
               <p>However, from all this it is not to be understood that the economic life of <name type="place">China</name> before the end of the third century B. C. had become highly commercialized. <name type="place">China</name> was, as it still is generally, fundamentally agrarian. Economic production was not as much for the market as it was for the immediate needs of the household. Yet, in the framework of this agrarian economy, commerce had made its appearance, grown in importance, served well the economic life of ancient <name type="place">China</name>, and called forth the use of metallic money, which gained increasing significance as trade developed ever further.</p>
               <p>Even if the use of metallic money had been prevailing, it may be assumed that not every business transaction was made through this medium of exchange. Compared with <name type="place">Chou</name>
                  <name type="place">China</name>, the Mediterranean
<pb n="53"/>
world of antiquity appears to have been more commercialized. Even in this case Prof. <name type="pname">W. L. Westermann</name> has cautioned us not to minimize exchange in kind against exchange in money; for, he argues, "Constantly throughout antiquity exchange in natura and exchange in money form appear side by side."<ref target="#CH2-n130">130</ref> The same may be also said of <name type="place">China</name> of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period.</p>

                  <p>T'üng is not known as an iron producing area in either ancient or modern times. According to Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien, places where iron industry produced great fortunes in the Chan-kuo period were Chao including Han-tan, Lin-Ch'iung in Shu, Liang (Wei), Wan in Ch'u and Lu.

In enumerating quantities of merchandise we have altered the wording of the <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi> text from which we have quoted. For instance, in the original Chinese the phrase "100 slaves" reads <hi rend="italic">t'ung shou ch'ih ch'ien</hi> (one thousand fingers of slaves). Since each slave has ten fingers, we have changed the wording to a simpler expression. Similar changes have been made at other points.</p>

With regards to "Wei" the comments advanced are not convincing. Prince Ching of Wei was not known for his riches; nor was the lord of Shang. Furthermore, if it were the Lord of <name type="place">Shang</name> who is referred to as "Wei," why is he not directly referred to as "Shang," but as "Wei?" as in the case of the lord of 'T'ao? If we understand "T'ao and Wei" as two places equally renowned for their wealth, then we will have no trouble in interpreting the text and the context in which the phrase stands. In the <hi rend="italic">Han-fei-tzǔ</hi> "T'ao and Wei" are mentioned as places of great importance. (V, 11a).</p>

               </head>
               <p>In his brief treatment of money in Chinese antiquity, Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien (145—86 B. C.?) mentions tortoise shells and cowrie shells as objects which had been used as currency and indicates that pearls, jade and tin had also been so used besides gold, silver, and the spade and knife coins of bronze.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> Scattered statements in the literature of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period tend to lend credit to his report. However, it is rather unlikely that all of these were used without preference either throughout the whole <name type="place">Chou</name> period, or in all parts of ancient <name type="place">China</name>. This would be true especially after trade had developed to a considerable extent, say from the Ch'un-ch'iu period on, when portability and homogeneity would be required of a currency. Tortoise shells were of limited use in divination only and are too bulky to be conveniently transported. Pearls and jade did not exist in any appreciable quantity. Neither gold, nor silver, nor tin was produced within the borders of the <name type="place">Shang</name> and the <name type="place">Chou</name> kingdoms, and therefore they lacked another requirement of a currency — general availability. Because of their limited availability and consequently high value, they could not have been suitable for use in ordinary business transactions. Among the monetary commodities mentioned by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien, only cowrie shells, copper and bronze met both these qualifications of a satisfactory exchange medium, portability and availability.</p>
               <pb n="55"/>
               <p>To be sure, neither copper nor cowries were of local origin, but they seemed to have been available in such quantities that they could have served as currency.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> Both were employed in the beginning as barter units, copper in the form of a spade or a knife and cowries as ornaments. Spades and knives were commodities of general use, and cowries owed their desirability as money to their highly ornamental value and their magic functions. This agrees with the general principles on the origin of money laid down by <name type="pname">William Ridgeway</name>.</p>
               <p>The importation and use of cowrie shells in <name type="place">China</name> has had a long history. It is well known that a specimen was discovered by <name type="pname">J. G. Andersson</name> at the neolithic site at Yang-shao-ts'un, <name type="place">Honan</name>. In the graves of Chu Chia Chai, which also contained pottery of the "Yang-shao" stage, a piece of bone was found carved in imitation of a cowrie shell.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> Seventy-three genuine shells were dug out of the old tombs at Tou-chi-t'ai in the county of Pao-chi, western <name type="place">Shensi</name>. They evidently served as both ornaments and for magical purposes.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> The archaeologist Su Ping-ch'i has dated these tombs as belonging to the period of "bent-feet <hi rend="italic">li"</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">li</hi> is a tripod), which in his chronology is intermediate between the black pottery (Lung-shan type) culture and the end of the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty.</p>
               <p>When the site of Yin-hsü, at <name type="place">An-yang</name> (northern <name type="place">Honan</name>), which served as a capital to the <name type="place">Shang</name> kings for the last four to five hundred years of their dynasty was excavated by archaeologists of Academia Sinica, large numbers of the shells were discovered. During the first season, in 1928, ninety-six "cowrie shells and large clam shell utensils" were excavated.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> In 1929, a pit designated as Ta-lien yielded "a layer of cowries" together with some bronze objects and stone knives at a

other Chinese scholars.<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> While in an earlier publication <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> seems to have the idea that cowrie shells were used as money during the <name type="place">Shang</name> time;<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> in a later one he expresses the opinion that use of cowries as money began during the transitional period from the <name type="place">Shang</name> to the <name type="place">Chou</name>, <ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> which, according to the traditional chronology, is around 1122 B. C. However, none of these scholars has produced any evidence to support their opinions.</p>
               <p>Before attempting our own answer to the question, let us first examine the available facts, archaeological as well as historical. In the literature of or concerning the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty we have only one statement on the cowries. It is in the chapter P'an-küng in the <hi rend="italic">Shang-shu</hi> (Book of Documents), popularly known as the <hi rend="italic">Shu ching.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref>
                  <pb n="58"/>
In this document, P'an-küng, the <name type="place">Shang</name> king who moved the <name type="place">Shang</name> capital to Yin (hence <name type="place">Shang</name> is also designated as Yin) on the site of what is now known as Yin-hsü, reproached his ministers for neglecting their duties and coveting "cowries and jade." At the end of the document the king instructs his ministers thus, "You shall not accumulate the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">pao</hi> and make profits for your own use." "<hi rend="italic">Huo</hi>" means "money," and <hi rend="italic">"pao"</hi> means "treasures." These words obviously have reference to the "cowries and jade" used in the beginning of the document. Since these objects, or at least one of them, could yield the profit or income indicated in the words of P'an-küng,
<pb n="59"/>
they obviously had an economic function beyond their ornamental value.</p>
               <p>The importance attached to cowrie shells by the <name type="place">Shang</name> and their possible monetary function may also be gathered from certain inscriptions on oracle bones, which are of a divinatory character, and those on bronze vessels, which serve a commemorative purpose. One oracle bone inscription says:</p>
               <q>(Divined) on <hi rend="italic">küng-hsü</hi> day, (a personal name) declaring the query: Grant (one) <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries to the mothers (or wives).<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref>
               </q>
               <p>Another, which is very fragmentary, reads:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Mother (or wife)</l>
                  <l>ten <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> (of cowries)</l>
                  <l>( ) the sons.<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>These are divinations for granting cowries. The <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> is the unit which will be discussed on another occasion.</p>
               <p>A third oracle bone inscription is a divination asking whether cowries would be captured. It reads:</p>
               <q>Divined on <hi rend="italic">wu-shün</hi> day, (a personal name) declaring the query: Would there be captured cowries?<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref>
               </q>
               <p>Besides these there are four more fragmentary inscriptions recording the "taking" (or "receiving") of cowries:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1.">... takes cowries.<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref>
                  </item>
                  <item n="2.">... takes one hundred cowries</item>
                  <item>... takes six hundred cowries.<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <pb n="60"/>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="3.">... takes cowries.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref>
                  </item>
                  <item n="4.">Divined on <hi rend="italic">ting-hai</hi> day, Kuang takes two <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries, in the first month. Took.<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The meaning of the character <hi rend="italic">ch'ü</hi> (to take) in the inscriptions above quoted is not clear. It may have been used in the sense of "to receive" as Dr. <name type="pname">R. S. Britton</name> has indicated. In a number of the <name type="place">Chou</name> bronze inscriptions there are found expressions such as <hi rend="italic">"ch'ü</hi> (an undecipherable monetary appellation) five <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> (a weight or monetary unit)," <hi rend="italic">"ch'ü</hi> ( ) twenty <hi rend="italic">lieh,"</hi> and <hi rend="italic">"ch'ü</hi> ( ) thirty <hi rend="italic">lieh."</hi> Those who take or receive the money <hi rend="italic">(ch'ü)</hi> are all ministers of the <name type="place">Chou</name> court. <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> regards the expression as denoting that a given minister takes (or receives) a given amount of money as monthly salary.<ref target="#CH3-n22">22</ref> This interpretation is plausible. However, whether the same character is used in the same sense as it is in the oracle bone inscriptions is hard to say.</p>
               <p>According to <name type="pname">Tung Tso-pin</name>, inscription No. 1 belongs to the period ending 1281 B. C.; No. 2 belongs to the period from 1240 to 1227 B. C.; Nos. 3 and 4 belong to the period from 1209 to 1112 B. C., which corresponds to the reigns of the last two kings of the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty.<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the inscriptions of the <name type="place">Shang</name> bronzes we more frequently find references to grants of cowries to those who had the bronzes made. There are nine such inscriptions in the <hi rend="italic">Yin wün ts'un</hi> (A Collection of the Yin or <name type="place">Shang</name> bronze inscriptions) and the <hi rend="italic">Hsü Yin wün ts'un</hi> (a supplement to the former work).<ref target="#CH3-n24">24</ref> A typical one reads:</p>
               <q>On the day <hi rend="italic">ting-mao</hi> the king ordered Tsu-tzǔ to meet (the chief or representative of) the Kuei state at Hsing.</q>
               <pb n="61"/>
               <q>Upon his return the king rewarded him with one <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of the cowries which were captured in the expedition against Yung. For this he (Tsu-tzǔ) made this tripod in honor of his father I.<ref target="#CH3-n25">25</ref>
               </q>
               <p>In some of the inscriptions the number of <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> granted is not recorded, a fact which indicates that the number may be one. The numbers which are given range from one to ten.</p>
               <p>The fact that meritorious ministers of the <name type="place">Shang</name> kings were rewarded with cowries which evidently served no ornamental purpose indicates strongly the financial value of the shells.<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the inscriptions of the <name type="place">Chou</name> bronzes, especially those of the first three centuries of the dynasty, the use of cowries as rewards and gifts by kings and nobles to their inferiors is very conspicuous. Of the 162 inscriptions concerning the royal court of <name type="place">Chou</name>, which have been collected, dated and discussed by <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> in his <hi rend="italic">Liang <name type="pname">Chou</name> chin-wün-tz'ǔ ta-hsi k'ao-shih</hi>, twenty-one contain statements of grants of cowries as rewards or gifts. The bronze inscriptions on the vessels classified by him as belonging to the various feudatories are not included in this count.<ref target="#CH3-n27">27</ref> The following are two examples in the simplest form:</p>
               <pb n="62"/>
               <q>In the thirteenth month, on the day <hi rend="italic">hsin-mao</hi>, the King was at Han. He granted Ch'ien a fief called (the name of the fief, undecipherable). He granted [him also] five <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries. In gratitude for the king's favor, he (Ch'ien) had this Chi precious vessel made.<ref target="#CH3-n28">28</ref>
               </q>
               <q>When King Ch'Sng offered the great Pün sacrifice at Tsung-<name type="place">Chou</name> (capital of <name type="place">Chou</name> ), he rewarded Marquis Hsien, Hsiao, cowries. For this he (Marquis Hsien) had this Marquis Ting vessel made. Pien-yüan [clan].<ref target="#CH3-n29">29</ref>
               </q>
               <p>Although the reasons for these grants are not expressed, it is obvious that they were made in return for some meritorious service by the beneficiaries. Another inscription on a <hi rend="italic">kuei</hi> vessel made by Su indicates that he received cowries and was exempted from further military service on account of his valor in a campaign against the Eastern Barbarians.<ref target="#CH3-n30">30</ref> A tripod made by Lu bears a record that ten <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries had been bestowed upon him for his contributions in a campaign against a barbarian people in revolt.<ref target="#CH3-n31">31</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As to the question whether cowries were used as money during the <name type="place">Chou</name> time, we have not the slightest doubt. The well informed great historian Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien says that they were,<ref target="#CH3-n32">32</ref> as do the learned scholar Hsü Shün (first century A. D.)<ref target="#CH3-n33">33</ref> and the authoritative commentator on the Confucian classics, Chüng Hsüan (127—200).<ref target="#CH3-n34">34</ref> In the original text of the <hi rend="italic">I</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">I ching</hi> (a book for divination) the loss of cowries is expressed as the loss of property.<ref target="#CH3-n35">35</ref> In a love ode in the <hi rend="italic">Shih</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Shih ching</hi> (a book of odes) a girl sings that after she met her man he gave her one hundred <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> as a gift.<ref target="#CH3-n36">36</ref> As has been correctly commented by Chüng Hsüan, the phrase "one hundred <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi>" means
<pb n="63"/>
that many <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries.<ref target="#CH3-n37">37</ref> Since the amount of the gift is very large, it is not likely that the cowries were ornamental objects. In the <hi rend="italic">Li chi</hi> (Book of Rules), another Confucian classic, it is advised that if an inferior wants to give gold, jade, or "money cowries" to his lord when the latter is about to go on a trip, it is proper for him to say that he wishes to present some "horse fare" (traveling fare) to his lord's attendants.<ref target="#CH3-n38">38</ref> The word "money" in the phrase "money cowries" is <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>, which, when used in the <name type="place">Chou</name> literature to denote a gift, may mean gold, jade, silk, furs or any other valuable. Since in this case gold and jade, which are also <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> for gift, have been specifically mentioned, the character in the present text can only mean "money" modifying "cowries."</p>
               <p>The use of cowrie shells as money is also corroborated by archaeological finds. In recent years, large numbers of cowries have been discovered in the graves of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period. The conditions in which they were discovered point to the fact that they were money. In a tomb uncovered in 1923 at Hsin-chüng in central <name type="place">Honan</name>, 317 cowrie shells were found.<ref target="#CH3-n39">39</ref> The excavation was not performed by trained archaeologists, and therefore exact information is not given; but according to Kuan Pao-ch'ien, these cowrie shells were found in one tomb. They were not deposited at the place where the coffin lay, but in and around a large bronze tripod and a square bronze <hi rend="italic">tsüng</hi> vessel at the southern end of the grave.<ref target="#CH3-n40">40</ref> Judging from the large number of bronze vessels found, the tomb must have contained the bones of a member of the high nobility. Since cowries occurred in such quantity to preclude their use as magical objects, and because of their disposition at a distance from the body, Kuan Pao-ch'ien was led to conclude, and rightly so, that these cowries functioned as mortuary gifts, money to be used by the dead.<ref target="#CH3-n41">41</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="64"/>
               <p>From the spring of 1932 to December, 1933, about a hundred tombs of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period were found in Chun County in northern <name type="place">Honan</name>, about forty miles southeast of Yin-hsü. From some of them 3472 cowrie shells were recovered. These cowries, "mostly" deposited around the burial vessels, were strung together.<ref target="#CH3-n42">42</ref> According to Kuo Pao-chün, the archaeologist, these were tombs of members of the ruling house of Wei, ranging in date from its first ancestor, K'ang-shu, who was enfeoffed in 1113 B. C. (traditional date), to Duke Ch'üng (634—589 B. C.).<ref target="#CH3-n43">43</ref> The earliest datable bronze vessel, a <hi rend="italic">tsun</hi>, is said to have been made by Duke Wu (812—758 B. C.).<ref target="#CH3-n44">44</ref> Since their disposition is like that of the shells in the Hsin-Chüng tomb (namely, in or around the burial vessels at a distance from the corpse), we are inclined to regard them also as money, and the money for the dead is an imitation of that for the living.</p>
               <p>If all this evidence should fail to convince our readers that cowries were used as money during the <name type="place">Chou</name> period, we offer one more piece which should be sufficient to rid them of any doubt. This is an inscription on a bronze <hi rend="italic">tsun</hi> vessel. It reads:</p>
               <q>Lord of Chü, Yüan, had this precious vessel made. He used fourteen <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries.<ref target="#CH3-n45">45</ref>
               </q>
               <p>The inscription is probably of early <name type="place">Chou</name> origin.<ref target="#CH3-n46">46</ref> No record can be more definite. Since cowrie shells were used as money by the <name type="place">Chou</name>
                  <pb n="65"/>
people and since such usage is recorded on the above cited vessel, a natural inference is that the cowries mentioned as rewards and gifts on other bronze vessels may also be considered as money.</p>
               <p>So much for the monetary nature of cowrie shells used by the <name type="place">Chou</name> people as recorded in their bronze inscriptions. Are the cowrie shell grants recorded in the inscriptions of the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty of the same nature? Our answer is affirmative. These are the reasons. First, a comparative study of the bronze inscriptions of both the <name type="place">Shang</name> and the <name type="place">Chou</name> periods in which the grants of cowrie shells are recorded and of which examples have been quoted above reveals an unmistakable similarity between the two in the way the cowries were granted, both in the formulation of the statements of the grants and in their economic implications. Since the cowrie shells in the <name type="place">Chou</name> inscriptions are money, those recorded in the <name type="place">Shang</name> inscriptions of similar nature must be the same.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we know that King Wu, conqueror of <name type="place">Shang</name> and founder of <name type="place">Chou</name>, already made grants of money, as evidenced by the inscription on a <hi rend="italic">chih</hi> wine vessel which records the courtier Tan as the recipient of such a gift.<ref target="#CH3-n47">47</ref> In view of the fact that the <name type="place">Chou</name> people were rather backward economically, it does not seem likely that the founder of this dynasty should have initiated such an advanced institution as money. Therefore, the use of cowrie shells as money must have originated in the <name type="place">Shang</name> period.</p>
               <p>As we have stated before, the <name type="place">Shang</name> people had already engaged in trade and carried their business to distant regions. Under those circumstances, their use of money was not only natural but probably inevitable. Thus we arrive at the conclusion that the <name type="place">Shang</name> people used money (of which cowrie shells were one form), and that the cowrie shells discovered in the <name type="place">Shang</name> remains must have been money or material to be used as money.<ref target="#CH3-n48">48</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="66"/>
               <p>This conclusion does not, of course, exclude the possibility that the <name type="place">Shang</name> people also used cowries for other purposes. It is almost certain that they served also as ornamental and magical objects, and it is as such that they acquired value, which led to their use as money. Most likely their function as ornamental and magical objects continued long after other more satisfactory media replaced them as currency.</p>

                  <p>In one of his articles on the findings at Yin-hsü, Li Chi says "Both the cowrie and clam shells were carved into ornaments; they were also money in circulation at the time. The salt-water shells were mostly used for money, and the fresh-water shells were mostly used for ornaments." <hi rend="italic">An-yang fa-chüeh pao-kao</hi>, IV (1933), 375. This statement is shrouded in ambiguity. It is regretted that Prof. Li, like all others dealing with the problem, fails to offer any evidence to prove his point.

Not in direct connection with the Yin-hsü finds, but rather in a general manner, some other scholars have expressed similar opinions. Terrien de Lacouperie has alleged that cowrie shells had been used as currency as far back as the twenty-third century B. C. ("Metallic Cowries of Ancient <name type="place">China</name>," <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland</hi>, XX, 1888, 428 ft.). <name type="pname">Henry A. Ramsden</name> says that cowrie shells were used as money during the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty ("The Cowry Currency of Ancient <name type="place">China</name>," <hi rend="italic">The Numismatic and Philatelic Journal of Japan</hi>, II, 1913, 161). A number of other Western numismatists share their opinion. <name type="pname">Henry E. Gibson</name> even goes as far as to allege, "It has been definitely determined that during the <name type="place">Shang</name> period (1766—1122 B. C.) the use of Cypraea shells as a medium of exchange was well established and actually the money of the period." ("The Use of Cowries as Money During the <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> Periods," <hi rend="italic">Jour. N. C. B. Royal Asiat. Soc.</hi> LXXI, 1940,33.) But if we should ask how and when the question "has been definitely determined," <name type="pname">Mr.Gibson</name> may not be able to answer. Copied from one another a belief has become a conviction, and a conviction a fact.</p>

                  <p>The P'an-küng chapter in the <hi rend="italic">Shang-shu</hi> has been accepted as a reliable document concerning the <name type="place">Shang</name> dynasty by such leading Chinese historians as Wang Kuo-wei in the past <hi rend="italic">(Ku shih hsin chüng)</hi>, and <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> at the present <hi rend="italic">(Shih p'i-p'an shu</hi>, 1945, 15). But <name type="pname">Creel</name> contends that it is a forgery, and certainly it cannot be regarded as reliable historical literature. The reasons which <name type="pname">Creel</name> lists to prove the document a forgery are: 1) During the <name type="place">Shang</name> time its capital was called <name type="place">Shang</name> or <hi rend="italic">ta i Shang</hi>, "the great city Shang," while in the document it is called Yin; 2) In the inscriptions on the oracle bones the chief <name type="place">Shang</name> deity is the <hi rend="italic">Shang Ti</hi> (god on high) while in the document it is <hi rend="italic">T'ien</hi> (Heaven); 3) The style of the writing does not seem to be of <name type="place">Shang</name> origin because it is smoother than the inscriptions or the authentic books of the Western <name type="place">Chou</name> period; 4) The document fails to state the reasons why P'an-keng moved his capital to Yin, a fact which shows the forger to be ignorant of them. <hi rend="italic">(Studies in Early Chinese Culture</hi>, Baltimore, 1937, 65—67)-Creel's accusations show some legitimate ground to doubt the writing as a contemporary original document, but they are not sufficiently strong to prove it a forgery. The factors which led P'an-keng to move his capital to Yin may have been known to his people, and thus a statement on that point may have not been necessary. The question of the style, while plausible in one respect, is uncertain in others. Any comparison of the writing with the terse inscriptions on the bronze vessels for obvious reasons is inappropriate. Compared with <name type="place">Chou</name> literary documents its smoothness is very slight, and it is a matter of degree not of substance. I, for one, cannot be sure if I understand correctly more than half of the document. Other scholars may not be able to claim much more. Furthermore, in intellectual training and in cultural life as a whole the <name type="place">Shang</name> people were much superior to the <name type="place">Chou</name>. It is not unnatural to find better writing by the hands of <name type="place">Shang</name> intellectuals. Later revisions and copyist changes may have taken place and altered the original composition somewhat. But revision does not imply forgery. Creel's discussion on the god of T'ien is based on negative evidence. The <name type="place">Chou</name> people worshipped both <hi rend="italic">T'ien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shang Ti.</hi> The <name type="place">Shang</name> people may have done the same. The phrase which Creel reads <hi rend="italic">ta i Shang</hi> is also written <hi rend="italic">t'ien i Shang</hi> in no less than three oracle bone inscriptions. On the name of the capital of P'an-keng, Creel shows that he has not studied the inscriptions on the oracle bones carefully. In those inscriptions "Shang" or the <hi rend="italic">"ta i Shang"</hi> or <hi rend="italic">'t'ien i Shang"</hi> does not refer to the capital in Yin to which P'an-küng moved but to the older capital of <name type="place">Shang</name> which was what is now called Shang-ch'iu in eastern <name type="place">Honan</name> (See <name type="pname">Tung Tso-pin</name>, <hi rend="italic">Yin li p'u</hi>, 1945, Part II, IX, 62f). Shang-ch'iu was also the capital of the Sung state during the <name type="place">Chou</name> dynasty, and the ruling house of the Sung state were the descendents of the <name type="place">Shang</name> kings.</p>

                  <p>The cowrie shells discovered in the Shang remains are said to be of two types(?). One type has its dorsal side ground flat while the other has a hole instead. It is not known whether the grinding of their dorsal side has any relation with their use as money or ornamental objects, though Prof. <name type="pname">Tung Tso-pin</name> has voiced the opinion that those with their dorsal sides ground flat were used as money. All the cowrie shells recovered from the <name type="place">Chou</name> tombs seem to have been ground flat.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Although cowrie shells have been discovered by the thousands in <name type="place">Shang</name> remains and <name type="place">Chou</name> tombs, detailed descriptions of them are regrettingly lacking. Some of the shells discovered between 1928 and 1932 in Yin-hsü are described by Li Chi, the archaeologist, as "saltwater-shells."<ref target="#CH3-n49">49</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Tung Tso-pin</name>, who also took part in the excavations, has informed the author that some of the cowrie shells found in the Yin or <name type="place">Shang</name> ruins have their dorsal side ground flat and that others have been holed only. The Japanese scholar <name type="pname">Nishimura</name> Shinji reports that he possesses a cowrie shell which was originally deposited in a bronze <hi rend="italic">lei</hi> vessel discovered in Yin-hsü. He identifies his shell as of the species <hi rend="italic">Cypraea moneta</hi>.<ref target="#CH3-n50">50</ref> It is 22 mm. in length and 17 mm. in width. Each of the outer labia on the front has twelve horizontal nicks. The color of the outside surface seems to have been a lustrous light yellow. However, most of the enamel part has been worn away. It has a large hole on its dorsal side, which, as he says, is probably due to the shell having been ground down to a flattish oval shape.<ref target="#CH3-n51">51</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The collection of the Museum of The American Numismatic Society has twenty-four specimens of cowrie shells (cf. <ref target="#fig-6">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 1—3</ref>). Of them twenty are from the collection of <name type="pname">Henry A. Ramsden</name>, and four
<pb n="67"/>
are from that of <name type="pname">John Reilly</name>, Jr. They are of the species of <hi rend="italic">Cypraea moneta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cypraea annulus</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Cypraea moneta</hi> has a purple top on the dorsal side, and the <hi rend="italic">Cypraea annulus</hi> has a yellow ring around the top. The species of those whose dorsal sides have been ground flat or broken off can be identified by a comparison of their ventral sides. Three of the four specimens in the collection of Mr. <name type="pname">Reilly</name> have been badly decomposed, their enamel having disappeared altogether. Their dorsal sides are ground flat. The inside of the shells is filled with aged earth, a sign of long burial under ground. In size they average 20 mm. in length and 15 mm. in width.</p>
               <p>According to <name type="pname">Ramsden</name> his twenty specimens formed part of a find discovered in the neighborhood of Chang-tü-fu, <name type="place">Honan</name>, May, 1913.<ref target="#CH3-n52">52</ref> Chang-tü-fu is the modern <name type="place">An-yang</name>, where in Yin-hsü, or the "ruins of Yin (Shang)," the bronzes and oracle bones of that dynasty were dug up. If the report is correct, <name type="pname">Ramsden</name>'s specimens may have come from the same ancient site. These specimens (cf. <ref target="#fig-6">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 1</ref>, <ref target="#fig-8">3</ref>) have been described and illustrated in <name type="pname">Ramsden</name>'s article, "The Cowry Currency of Ancient <name type="place">China</name>," published in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatic and Philatelic Journal of Japan</hi> in 1913. They are of various sizes. The largest measures 30.5 mm. in length, with thirteen horizontal nicks on the right and twelve on the left of the ventral side. The smallest measures 12 mm. in length with eleven horizontal nicks on the right and twelve on the left of its ventral side. Six of them have their dorsal side ground flat. Fourteen others have one or two apertures. The holes on three are so large that it appears as though the shells had been ground down to that point. All are discolored, and the surfaces of most of them are decomposed.</p>
               <p>As is generally known, both <hi rend="italic">Cypraea moneta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cypraea annulus</hi> grow in large numbers in the Indian Ocean and some parts of the South Seas. Neither species is found in the <name type="place">China</name> seas. In a letter to the author, Dr. <name type="pname">William Ingram</name>, an expert on mollusks, says that the places nearest to <name type="place">China</name> where cowrie shells are reported to have been
<pb n="68"/>
found are the Japan seas in the Japanese <name type="place">Islands</name>, <name type="place">Formosa</name>, the <name type="place">Hong Kong</name> area, the <name type="place">Cochin</name> coast, the <name type="place">Philippines</name>, and certain areas on the <name type="place">Malay Peninsula</name>. He adds that they are also reported to have been found on the <name type="place">China</name> coast, but this is not confirmed. Dr.<name type="pname">John C.</name> Armstrong of the American Museum of Natural History mentioned to the author the area around the Tizard Banks, the <name type="place">Ryukyus</name> and Hakodate in Japan as the habitat of the cowries which is nearest to <name type="place">China</name>, observing that he was skeptical about reports on other places because they were not made by scientists. Even if reports on these doubtful localities were reliable, the number of cowrie shells growing at them cannot have been large.</p>
               <p>Some of the cowrie shells found in the <name type="place">Shang</name> and the <name type="place">Chou</name> remains may have come from any of the places mentioned above. Some may have been brought from as far as the coast of the Indian Ocean and the islands off the Indian Peninsula. A passage in the later edition of the <hi rend="italic">Bamboo Annals</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Chin-pün chu-shu-chi-nien</hi>) states that in the first year of King Li of <name type="place">Chou</name> (877—842 B. C. in the traditional chronology) the state of Ch'u in the present Yangtze valley sent cowries to the <name type="place">Chou</name> court as tribute. Although the passage is found only in the later edition, there is reason to believe that the record is reliable.<ref target="#CH3-n53">53</ref> Similar payments of which we have no record must have been made in other years.</p>
               <pb n="69"/>
               <p>Next to tribute, war booty was probably the main source of cowries for the court of <name type="place">Chou</name>. A number of bronze vessel inscriptions refer to "capture of cowries,"<ref target="#CH3-n54">54</ref> an event which must have been of some importance to be commemorated by the casting of a bronze vessel. While there is no mention of the exact amounts of such loot, it may be assumed that it was considerable in quantity.</p>
               <p>Besides these sources of cowries a third can be reasonably assumed, ordinary exchange with the people who possessed, or had access to, them and the amount so acquired by the Chinese may have been considerable.</p>

                     <graphic url="NNM122_068b.jpg"/> for "white" and <hi rend="italic">pei</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_068c.jpg"/> for "cowrie," is understood by <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> as the original form of the character <hi rend="italic">pu</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_068d.jpg"/> (spade coin or cloth) <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi>, 144a and 148b). But this suggestion is untenable. Since the character is composed of the character for "white" and the character for "cowrie," there is reason to understand it as signifying "white cowrie." The character might have been coined to differentiate white cowries from cowries (or shells other than cowries) of variegated colors. Both <hi rend="italic">Cypraea tnoneta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cypraea annulus</hi> which have been discovered in the remains of the <name type="place">Shang</name> and the <name type="place">Chou</name> periods are predominantly white. If our suggestion is satisfactory, then "White cowries" must have been a specified tribute offered by the Huai people to the <name type="place">Chou</name> court.<lb/>
In the inscription on the <hi rend="italic">kuei</hi> vessel made by the head of the Huai state <hi rend="italic">(op. cit</hi>., 147a) it is stated that the chief of a certain conquered state came to the <name type="place">Chou</name> king to offer <graphic url="NNM122_068e.jpg"/> Composed of <hi rend="italic">po</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_068f.jpg"/> and <hi rend="italic">pei</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_068g.jpg"/> ( (cowrie) the character has been correctly identified by <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> and other epigraphers with the character for "white cowries" discussed above <hi rend="italic">(op. cit</hi>., 144a). It is interesting to note that the state which offered <graphic url="NNM122_068h.jpg"/> as tribute was also situated in the south (in the middle Yangtze River valley). It was from the south that cowrie shells reached the <name type="place">Chou</name> people.<lb/>
The practice of exacting cowries from the southern states as tribute seems to have lasted for a long time. As late as 179 B. C. the Southern Yüeh state in present Kuang-tung province is recorded to have offered them as tribute to the imperial court of Han <hi rend="italic">(Han shu</hi>, XCV, 28b).</p>

               </head>
               <p>Various materials have been used in making imitations of cowrie shells. Lo Chün-yü has reported the discovery of bones carved in the form of cowries in Tz'ǔ-<name type="place">Chou</name> (present day Tz'u County), southern Hopeh, not far from <name type="place">An-yang</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n55">55</ref> According to <name type="pname">Hamada Kosaku</name>, Lo had in his possession forty such specimens found in Hsin-an County, western <name type="place">Honan</name>, and in T'üng County, southern <name type="place">Shantung</name>, twenty from each place.<ref target="#CH3-n56">56</ref> The American Numismatic Society has thirty cowrie imitations in its collection, some of which, according to
<pb n="70"/>
                  <name type="pname">Ramsden</name>, belong to finds made at Tsinan, capital of <name type="place">Shantung</name> province, and Chang-tü-fu, the present-day <name type="place">An-yang</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n57">57</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Ramsden</name> gives Ying-yang in central <name type="place">Honan</name> below the Yellow River as another source for some of the pseudo-cowries in this collection.<ref target="#CH3-n58">58</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Nishimura</name> Shinji and Okutaira Masahiro also report the discovery of such bone carvings at Yin-hsü.<ref target="#CH3-n59">59</ref> Both the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities in Stockholm and Mr. <name type="pname">H. E. Gibson</name> possess collections of imitation cowries whose provenance is unknown.<ref target="#CH3-n60">60</ref>
               </p>
               <p>According to Lo Chün-yü, a stone substitute of a cowrie shell has been found in Yin-hsü.<ref target="#CH3-n61">61</ref> A number of stone cowrie imitations are said by Chüng Chia-hsiang<ref target="#CH3-n62">62</ref> to have been found in Ho-chien, central Hopeh, and also probably K'ai-füng, eastern <name type="place">Honan</name>. <name type="pname">Gibson</name> reports that he had a specimen made of "black stone."<ref target="#CH3-n63">63</ref> In the collection of The American Numismatic Society there are three fine stone specimens.</p>
               <p>A substitute made of another kind of shell, probably from fresh water, is said to have been discovered in Yin-hsü, <name type="place">An-yang</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n63a">63a</ref> The existence of cowrie imitations of such material is reported by <name type="pname">Nishimura</name> and <name type="pname">Gibson</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n64">64</ref> Yin-hsü is also said to have yielded imitations made of "white marble,"<ref target="#CH3-n65">65</ref> which may be identical with some of the stone imitations reported by other numismatists.</p>
               <p>Cowrie imitations in bronze are comparatively rare; The American Numismatic Society has six specimens and the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities has a few.<ref target="#CH3-n66">66</ref> They are reported to have been found
<pb n="71"/>
at Yin-hsü (<name type="place">An-yang</name>, <name type="place">Honan</name>), Tz'ǔ-<name type="place">Chou</name> (Southern Hopeh), Chüng-<name type="place">Chou</name> (southern <name type="place">Honan</name>), and K'ai-füng (central <name type="place">Honan</name>).<ref target="#CH3-n67">67</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Chüng Chia-hsiang mentions jade imitations on which he gives no particulars.<ref target="#CH3-n68">68</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Nishimura</name> mentions imitations of "semi-precious stone," clay and iron, apparently excavated in Yin-hsü.<ref target="#CH3-n69">69</ref> It seems miraculous, of course, that such small objects of iron can have survived three thousand years in the soil. Gibson reports that he possessed imitations made of "a sort of quartz" and of ivory,<ref target="#CH3-n70">70</ref> but does not state their provenance. Articles by <name type="pname">Nishimura</name> and Gibson are illustrated with imitations of "mother-of-pearl," "quartz," "semi-precious stones," "ivory," and "shell."</p>
               <p>Of all the reported materials from which imitations of cowries have been made, it is only those of bone, stone, and bronze for which we can supply exact descriptions. The thirty bone imitations at the American Numismatic Society (cf. <ref target="#fig-9">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 4—7</ref>), originally in the <name type="pname">Ramsden</name> Collection, were described by H. A. <name type="pname">Ramsden</name> in his article "Cowrie Substitutes Used as Currency in Ancient <name type="place">China</name>."<ref target="#CH3-n70a">70a</ref> These may be divided roughly into three groups as follows:</p>
               <q>1. Generally large and thick, the largest being 26 mm. in length. Somewhat lozenge-shaped. Convex surface. Roughly carved. One hole, either at center or close to one end. Horizontal nicks along ventral groove (sixteen being the largest number) reaching as far as edge of surface. Reverse side, unpolished. Color, dark green.</q>
               <q>2. Average 19 mm. in length. Two holes symmetrically placed on reverse side. No horizontal nicks along ventral groove. Reverse, flat and polished. Colors, yellow and greenish gray.</q>
               <pb n="72"/>
               <q>3. Size about same as second group, largest being 22.5 mm. and smallest 17 mm. in length, but better carved and finished, and more realistic in imitation of a real shell. Oval in shape. Convex surface. With one exception, reverse is flat and polished. Edges along ventral groove curve slightly in resemblance of real shell. Horizontal nicks along ventral groove are short and resemble those of a genuine shell. Two round holes on reverse side. Colors range from yellowish white to brown, and from dark green to chocolate; white ones have patches of fresh green, possibly caused by contact with bronze vessels in which they may have been deposited.</q>
               <p>Belonging to the third group of bone imitations are two found in a <hi rend="italic">lei</hi> vessel which was unearthed at Yin-hsü according to <name type="pname">Nishimura</name>. His detailed observations on them are as follows:</p>
               <p>One is nearly symmetrical and forms an oval shape with pointed ends. Either edge of the deep groove in the center is marked with thirteen horizontal nicks. The top side is convex and brown, but the reverse side is flat and smooth and somewhat lighter in color. The holes at either end together with the central groove probably served to string the shell to other things. The other imitation is nearly the same as the first, though a little longer and more slender. Its lower part is narrower than the upper part. The central groove, which is marked with oblique nicks on both edges, is also wider at the upper part. The color is light brown on the reverse side, and the pale greenish tincture at the base of the right side is probably due to a saturation of bronze rust. There are two holes in the back. The latter is on the whole nearer to the real cowrie shell, as it is 23 mm. long, 17 mm. wide and 6 mm. high, while the former is 21 mm., 18 mm. and 5 mm. respectively.<ref target="#CH3-n71">71</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="73"/>
               <p>Certain cowrie imitations discovered in T'üng County in southern <name type="place">Shantung</name> and described by <name type="pname">Hamada Kosaku</name>
                  <ref target="#CH3-n72">72</ref> also belong to the third group, characterized as they are by a realistic resemblance to real shells. Other specimens reported by the same scholar as discovered at Hsin-an in western <name type="place">Honan</name> are roughly carved and have only one hole in the back. Because of the hole they may be considered as belonging to the third group of our classification also.</p>
               <p>Summarizing the above descriptions we may outline the characteristic features of the three groups of the bone imitations of cowries as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Roughly carved, somewhat lozenge-shaped, reverse not worked, one hole, large size.</item>
                  <item>2. Also roughly made, nearly oval-shaped, no horizontal nicks along the ventral groove, two holes, reverse flat and polished, medium size.</item>
                  <item>3. Finely and more artistically and realistically carved, polished on both sides, oval-shaped, two holes, smaller than Type One.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This general classification, however, is not intended to convey the impression that specimens within one group are the same in every aspect. As a matter of fact no two specimens have been found exactly alike in every detail. We group them together on the ground that their minor variations are comparatively insignificant as against the main features they share in common.</p>
               <p>The three stone imitations at The American Numismatic Society, all of which are finely carved, measure 25 by 17.5 mm. (<ref target="#fig-13">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 8</ref>), 22 by 16 mm., and 23 by 17 mm. All are oval in shape with one end slightly narrower than the other as with the bone imitations of the third type. The surfaces are carved and polished, while the reverses are flat. The ventral groove of each runs across the whole surface,
<pb n="74"/>
with curved edges resembling those on a real shell. The incised nicks along the groove are horizontal or nearly so. There are two holes on the reverse side positioned at the tip of either end. In color, they are gray with a strong green tinge.</p>
               <p>Chüng Chia-hsiang has published illustrations of two stone imitations in his possession, which differ greatly in workmanship. One appears to be finely carved, resembling very much the real shell, like the specimens at The American Numismatic Society, while the other is lozenge-shaped, without the central groove, and bears little resemblance to a cowrie shell.<ref target="#CH3-n73">73</ref> Thus we find that stone imitations vary considerably in workmanship.</p>
               <p>The American Numismatic Society has six bronze imitations, some of which were originally in the collection of <name type="pname">H. A. Ramsden</name> and have already been described by that numismatist.<ref target="#CH3-n74">74</ref> All six are oval in shape. Excepting on one specimen (<ref target="#fig-16">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 1</ref>), one end is slightly narrower than the other (as with the bone and stone imitations). They are made from thin bronze plate, convex on their top side and concave on the bottom. Again with only one exception (<ref target="#fig-16">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 1</ref>) all have a central groove which, unlike those on bone and stone imitations, does not reach the ends. One piece (<ref target="#fig-14">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 9</ref>) lacks horizontal nicks along the groove, while on two others (cf. <ref target="#fig-15">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 10</ref>) the nicks are distinct. Two pieces (<ref target="#fig-17">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 2</ref>, <ref target="#fig-18">3</ref>) show gilt on their top surfaces. The sixth specimen differs from the others: It is thicker, lacks the central groove and horizontal nicks, but it has the two holes, one at either end. The six pieces measure 24.5 by 16 mm., 24 by 16 mm., 24 by 15 mm., 28 by 17 mm., 23 by 16 mm., and 25 by 18 mm.</p>
               <p>Without a single exception, numismatists and historians who have written about the various imitations of cowries agree that they were used as money in ancient <name type="place">China</name>, as real cowrie shells had been. They believed that the substitutes resulted from a shortage in supply of the real shells. As plausible as this opinion seems, it fails to take into account one very important factor, the wide difference in value of
<pb n="75"/>
the materials from which the substitutes were made. Further, even among substitutes made of the same material there is a considerable range in quality of workmanship.</p>
               <p>Let us consider bone substitutes, as an example. With the sole exception of <name type="pname">Ramsden</name>, who calls them "horn substitutes," all numismatists regard them made of bone, but of bone of unknown origin. Mr. <name type="pname">A. G. Goodwin</name> of the American Museum of Natural History in <name type="place">New York</name> excludes the possibility that they are made of horn, because the structure of animal horn is not as hard and fine as that of our bone specimens. He was doubtful they were of a special kind of bone, for to distinguish one kind of bone from another when cut into such small pieces is practically impossible, especially for the average public which would have used them. In the opinion of Dr. <name type="pname">Nils Nelson</name>, also on the Natural History Museum staff, the colors of the bone imitations may not be original. More likely, they are the result of chemical reaction set up by contact with other material when buried underground. The green color was obviously produced by contact with bronze vessels.</p>
               <p>We are thus faced with a question not raised heretofore. If the material of these imitations is ordinary bone, they could have been carved in great quantity without difficulty, and obviously they could not have been accepted as equal in value to the real imported shells. This would hold true in greater degree for imitations of such an inferior material as stone. It seems more likely that bone and stone substitutes for cowries were used either as burial money, as ornaments, or as magic objects by those who could not afford the real shells.</p>
               <p>If substitutes had been used as money, they could not all have been in circulation simultaneously with real shells, for they could not have been regarded as equivalent to them. Adding to bone and stone substitutes those made of mother-of-pearl, jade and quartz, the situation is more complex still. In fact, it is so complex, that it is inconceivable they were all used as money, unless we assume that during the <name type="place">Shang</name> and early <name type="place">Chou</name> period there existed a complicated monetary system in which the real cowrie and each variety of its substitutes
<pb n="76"/>
had specific comparative values and definite rates of exchange. Such a condition, however, postulates a highly centralized governmental authority with full power both to issue and rigidly control money. Whether the courts of <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> had such power is a question. It was probably on account of these difficulties that Lo Chün-yü advanced the idea that substitutes were money of different times! According to him, the shell substitutes made probably of mother-of-pearl appeared first, and the substitutes made of bone and copper, the latter being the forerunner of the so-called <hi rend="italic">I pi ch'ien</hi> or "Ant nose money," followed successively.<ref target="#CH3-n75">75</ref> However, his chronological order does not include the substitutes made of other materials, and he is silent on the point whether the appearance of a new substitute means the replacement of the old. Like other numismatists, Lo Chün-yü also overlooked the problem of the relationship of the various imitations to the real shells, which remained in use throughout the entire period in which imitations were made. Lo's opinion is no more than a hypothesis which may prove untenable in the future. However, one of his points is worth noting, that the copper cowrie substitute is the forerunner of the so-called Ant Nose Money.</p>

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">I Pi Ch'ien</hi> (ant nose money), also known as <hi rend="italic">Kuei-lien ch'ien</hi> (ghost face money) or <hi rend="italic">Kuei-t'ou ch'ien</hi> (ghost head money), seems to be true metallic coinage.<ref target="#CH3-n76">76</ref> Inclusion of it in the present section on non-metallic currencies is warranted only by the fact that this type of coin is the last of the imitations of the cowrie shell.</p>
               <p>Ant nose money was never mentioned by Chinese historians until certain specimens discovered during the Sung dynasty came to the
<pb n="77"/>
notice of numismatists of that time. Its resemblance to the cowrie shell was recognized by Li Tso-hsien<ref target="#CH3-n77">77</ref> in 1874, and this point, spread by Lo Chün-yü, became accepted by practically all numismatists. It was Hung Tsun, author of <hi rend="italic">Ch'üan chih</hi> (Coin Catalogue), who, in his introductory section, first considered it to be real coinage. We learn from him that the term <hi rend="italic">I pi ch'ien</hi> had become a popular designation for this money as early as the twelfth century.</p>
               <p>The original meaning of the term, <hi rend="italic">I pi ch'ien</hi>, is not known exactly. Ma Ang regards it as signifying "ant and nose money," not as "ant-nose money" as understood by many. It is his opinion that "ant" comes from the pictoral impression of the legend <graphic url="NNM122_077a.jpg"/> which looks like an ant and which appears on one group. "Nose" comes from that part of the legend <graphic url="NNM122_077b.jpg"/> which looks like a human nose and which appears on another group.<ref target="#CH3-n78">78</ref> So far, this is the best interpretation, and may well be true. However, neither of these two terms was the original nomenclature, nor, strictly speaking, are they designations for this type of money.</p>
               <p>The term "ghost face money" is not difficult to explain. The legend <graphic url="NNM122_077c.jpg"/> mentioned above, appearing on an oval convex bronze piece, has a strong likeness to a caricature of the human face of a kind that often strikes the Chinese as a representation of a being of the other world. The term "ghost head money" can be explained in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Since Hung Tsun's time, more varieties have been discovered.
<pb n="78"/>
Some bear the legend <hi rend="italic">chün</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078a.jpg"/> some <hi rend="italic">hsing <graphic url="NNM122_078b.jpg"/>
                  </hi> some <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078c.jpg"/> and some <graphic url="NNM122_078d.jpg"/> this last being undecipherable. Ch'u Shang-ling quotes <name type="pname">Liu Shih-lu</name>, a noted numismatist, as having reported a seventh variety whose legend reads <hi rend="italic">t'ao</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078e.jpg"/>
                  <ref target="#CH3-n79">79</ref> of which we have seen neither an actual specimen nor an illustration.</p>
               <p>Of the six known varieties, the legends of three are easily recognizable. They are mentioned above as <hi rend="italic">chün, hsing</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>, meaning in modern nomenclature "lord," "go," and "metal" respectively. The decipherment of <graphic url="NNM122_078f.jpg"/> as <graphic url="NNM122_078g.jpg"/> (<hi rend="italic">shih-huo)</hi> meaning "ten <hi rend="italic">huo"</hi> is unacceptable, because the character supposed to be <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> does not agree with the forms of this character in other coin inscriptions or in the inscriptions on bronzes of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period, when these coins are said to have circulated.</p>
               <p>For the legends of <graphic url="NNM122_078h.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM122_078i.jpg"/> various decipherments have been suggested. Numismatists have read the first one as <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078j.jpg"/> (name of a state), or <hi rend="italic">k'u</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078k.jpg"/> (weep), or <hi rend="italic">tang-pan-liang</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078l.jpg"/> (equal to half ounce), or <hi rend="italic">hun-tien-shui</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078m.jpg"/> (to pacify water), or <hi rend="italic">pei</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078n.jpg"/> (cowrie), or <hi rend="italic">chi</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078o.jpg"/> (small). For the second legend there are the suggestions of <hi rend="italic">ssǔ</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078p.jpg"/> (a grave), <hi rend="italic">tang-kuo-liu-chu</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078q.jpg"/> (each equal to six <hi rend="italic">chu</hi>), <hi rend="italic">yu-t'u-chih-pün</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078r.jpg"/> (the basis for possessing the land), and <hi rend="italic">lo-i-chu</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_078s.jpg"/> (one <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> of the city of Lo). It is not necessary to repeat the reasons for which these decipherments have been made. It seems equally unnecessary to dwell on the reasons why they are unsound. We may state, in short, that none of them are epigraphically or philologically sound. Of all of these readings, <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> for <graphic url="NNM122_078t.jpg"/> and "one <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> of Lo" for <graphic url="NNM122_078u.jpg"/> are regarded as the best. Judging from the way the inscriptions on the knife, the spade, and the <hi rend="italic">Yüan-chin</hi> coins are made, <graphic url="NNM122_078v.jpg"/> seems to be a mint name or a serial character. This lends weight to its decipherment as <hi rend="italic">chin.</hi> But this decipherment not only meets difficulties in ancient epigraphy, but also does not agree with the fact that this type of money has never been discovered in the territory of the state with this name. Nor is there a town or

               <p>The reading "one <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> of Lo" does seem convincing, but epigraphically such a reading is unpermissible. What is supposed to be the lower component part <hi rend="italic">(k'ou</hi> meaning "mouth") in the character <hi rend="italic">lo</hi> is actually the outline of the hole of the coin. Even if it were a part of the character, it could not be read as the character for "mouth." "Mouth" in this form is not found in inscriptions on coins or bronzes of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period.</p>
               <p>The main features of this type of money have been described by <name type="pname">Ramsden</name>,<ref target="#CH3-n80">80</ref> whose collection forms part of the collection at The American Numismatic Society. The Society has 121 specimens, all of which are of bronze, though some of them have been so oxidized that they appear to be of some kind of stone. They are oval in shape, their observes being convex and reverses flat. All have a hole at one end, though on some the hole does not go completely through. The tip with the hole is slightly narrower, reminiscent of the physical appearance of the cowrie shell. The weights in grams of fifteen specimens in fairly good preservation are as follows: 3.03, 2.60, 2.62, 3.04,; 2.70 3.15, 3.05, 2.81, 1.78, 1.42, 1.40, 1.98, 4.30, 4.42, 3.72.</p>
               <p>The provenance of ant nose money is widely spread.

However, the exact location of the site is not known. The most recent discovery reported was made in 1936 in Shou-<name type="place">Chou</name>, officially Shou County, in central Anhui Province. It consisted of about one hundred and twenty or thirty pieces stuck together in an almost unbreakable mass. A few pieces which were successfully broken off are reported to bear the legend <graphic url="NNM122_080a.jpg"/>

               <p>A study of their provenance reveals an interesting point, that, except for their discovery in Ch'ang-an and <name type="place">Szechuan</name>, the reports of which are based on hearsay and consequently doubtful, ant nose money has been found at places well within the territory of the state of Ch'u of the Chan-kuo period (403—221 B. C.). Ku-shih is situated in the central area of the old state, and Shou-<name type="place">Chou</name>, then called Shou-ch'un, was its capital from 241 to 223 B. C. SuChou is the "eastern" part and Chiang-ning was in the "southern" part of the state. This suggests the possibility that ant nose money may have been a currency of the state of Ch'u.<ref target="#CH3-n88">88</ref>

               <pb n="81"/>
               <p>The attribution of this money to the state of Ch'u has been suggested previously, though the suggestion was not based on a complete study of its provenance. Chu Füng apparently reports the first discovery of "ant nose money" in Ku-shih, and he seems also to have first advanced the opinion that it was issued by King Chuang (613—591 B. C.) of the Ch'u state.<ref target="#CH3-n89">89</ref> A popular belief recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Ku-shih County Gazette</hi> says that the money was made by Sun Shu-ao, King Chuang's chief minister.<ref target="#CH3-n90">90</ref> Both of these assertions originated from a statement in the <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi> to the effect that King Chuang regarded the money in circulation as too "light" and attempted to coin "big ones" to replace the "small (light) ones." This monetary reform aroused resentment among his people. On the advice of Sun Shu-ao, his minister, the king abandoned his reform and allowed the "small ones" to continue to circulate.<ref target="#CH3-n91">91</ref> Chu Füng and the numismatists who follow his opinion obviously hold that the "ant nose money" must be the "small" coins referred to in the above story. There is no way, however, to prove that this identification is correct. Even if it were, the money could not have been issued by King Chuang or Sun Shu-ao, because, as the <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi> text shows, at the time when King Chuang became the king and Sun Shu-ao his minister, the "small ones" were already in circulation.</p>
               <p>The money is not recorded in literary sources. The style of their legends, such as the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">chün</hi>, suggests the possibility of their being late in date. The discovery of the money together with the round coin of the late Chan-kuo period, as reported by Ch'in Pao-tsan, tends to confirm this possibility. According to Ch'in Pao-tsan<ref target="#CH3-n92">92</ref>
                  <pb n="82"/>
sometime toward the close of the nineteenth century, a bronze <hi rend="italic">chüeh</hi> vessel was unearthed outside of the south city wall of SuChou. A round coin and several specimens of "ant nose money" were found in the vessel. The round coin has a square central hole and no rim on its outer circumference, and in illustration measures 28 mm. in diameter. It bears a legend which reads <hi rend="italic">chung shih-erh chu</hi> or "Weight, twelve <hi rend="italic">chu," chu</hi> being the smallest unit of weight in the coinage of the time. This coin belongs to the very last type of round coin of the third century B. C. and is the direct forerunner of the Pan-liang coin of Ch'in issued after Ch'in unified <name type="place">China</name> in 221 B. C. "Twelve <hi rend="italic">chu"</hi> and "<hi rend="italic">pan-liang"</hi> (1 <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> equal to 24 <hi rend="italic">chu)</hi> were different expressions common at that time for the same weight. Since the "ant nose money" was found together with this round coin, it seems to have been in circulation as late as the late third century B. C. The weight of the "twelve <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> coin" is about 11 grams, a weight derived from that of the Pan-liang coin of Ch'in. Judging from the fact that in early coinage money was still largely a commodity rather than a token, and weight was still a criterion for its value, the light-weight "ant nose money" must have been an auxiliary currency to supplement the round coin in business transactions.</p>
               <p>To summarize our observations we may say that the "ant nose money" <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> to have been a currency of the state of Ch'u. The date of its first appearance is unknown, but it was likely still in circulation in the late third century B. C. In all probability it was an auxiliary metal currency supplementing the <hi rend="italic">Yüan-chin</hi> of that state.<ref target="#CH3-n93">93</ref> During the Chan-kuo period the territory of Ch'u expanded greatly to the north and northeast, annexing much of the territory where the spade coin, and the round coin which succeeded the spade, were the main currency. The conquest of this territory by Ch'u was, by natural assumption, followed by the introduction of the Ch'u money. Hence the discovery of the "ant nose money" together with non-Ch'u money (i. e.,the round coin) in an originally non-Ch'u territory (conquered
<pb n="83"/>
by Ch'u in 261 B. C.). In the newly incorporated territory the money must have been used as an auxiliary currency, as it had been in its home domain.</p>

                  <p>Ever since their discovery in the 12th century these small bronze objects, generally known today as "ant nose money," have been regarded as money by numismatists and historians. Although this assumption lacks confirmation in the literary sources and corroboration by evidence other than the objects themselves, it appears plausible and acceptable. Kuei Fu <graphic url="NNM122_076a.jpg"/> (1736—1805), a famous philologist, disagreed. He read the legend on one group of this type of money as <hi rend="italic">hun-tien-shui</hi> (discussed below, p. 78), and from this reading he inferred that these objects were buried to pacify water (quotations from him are found in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Old Coins</hi>, II, 19a—19b). As we have pointed out, his reading of the legend is not acceptable, and therefore his suggestion concerning the function of these objects, inferred from the reading, must be discarded. Reading the legend on another group of this type of money as <hi rend="italic">ssǔ</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_076b.jpg"/> meaning "a grave" or "to dig a grave," Ch'u Shang-ling arrives at the conclusion that they were used in ancient times to be buried with the dead to ward off ants <hi rend="italic">(Chi chin so-chien lu</hi>, Coole, 9, XVI, 6b.). However, both his decipherment of the legend on the objects and his explanation of their function are untenable.</p>

The area of Ch'ang-an during the latter part of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period was in the territory of the state of Ch'in, which bordered on Ch'u on its southeast, and had close relations with the latter. <name type="place">Szechuan</name>, called Pa and Shu at that time, before it was conquered by Ch'in in 316 B. C. seems to have been under the domination of Ch'u. In this case, too, close relationship between these two areas can be assumed. Therefore, discovery of money of Ch'u in these two areas is not a matter of impossibility.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">5. PüNG, THE MEASURE OF COWRIES</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The unit for measuring quantities of cowrie shells as money was the <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_083a.jpg"/> whenever a unit was given. The only exceptions are in the inscriptions on an oracle bone cited above (p. 59) and on a <name type="place">Shang</name> bronze vessel,<ref target="#CH3-n94">94</ref> which record grants of "one hundred" and "six hundred" in one case and "two hundred" in another, as well as one <name type="place">Chou</name> bronze inscription in which the cowries are reckoned by the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>.<ref target="#CH3-n95">95</ref> The <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> is a monetary unit which will be discussed later (see pp. 207—211).</p>
               <p>In inscriptions on oracle bones, the pictograph of the character <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> is written <graphic url="NNM122_083b.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NNM122_083c.jpg"/>. On both <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> bronzes the latter form prevails with only minor variations in a few cases. The first form of the pictograph resembles a string of cowrie shells bent at the middle; it may well have derived from a necklace or other article of adornment which was made up of cowrie shells. It is presumed that when cowries came to be used as money, the unit in which they were reckoned as a medium of exchange was based on the original form in which they were used as ornaments.</p>
               <p>Of the two forms of the character, <graphic url="NNM122_083d.jpg"/> is probably the original. The difference between the two must have been caused by the fact that inscriptions on oracle bones are incised. When making an incision, a straight line is much easier to execute than a curved one. Hitherto scholars have held that the character <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> resembles two strings of cowries, hence the English rendering of the term as "double string" by Western scholars.<ref target="#CH3-n96">96</ref> The character can be viewed as composed of
<pb n="84"/>
two strings, but a more realistic hypothesis is that the "double string" is a single string curved at the middle with its pendent ends equal in length and with each end bearing an equal number of cowries.</p>
               <p>In a purely imaginative interpretation, <name type="pname">H. E. Gibson</name> traces the origin of the character to the way cowrie shells were supposed to have been carried during the <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> periods. As reconstructed by him, they were strung on two cords each having ten shells. The two cords of cowries were then attached to the two ends of a stick held by hand in the middle.<ref target="#CH3-n97">97</ref> This reconstructed picture of the way cowries were carried appears rather unrealistic; and it is obviously based on a notion derived from the later form of the character <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> rather than from the original.</p>
               <p>Earlier than <name type="pname">Gibson</name>,<name type="pname">L. Wieger</name> made the statement that "The cowries, current money of old <name type="place">China</name>, are offered strung up, often in great quantities, as much as a man can carry with a pole."<ref target="#CH3-n98">98</ref> Hence his rendering of <hi rend="italic">p'eng</hi> as "man-load."<ref target="#CH3-n99">99</ref> Although <name type="pname">H. F. Bowker</name> holds that <name type="pname">Wieger's</name> views should not be ignored,<ref target="#CH3-n100">100</ref> we feel they are worth little serious consideration.</p>
               <p>The use of the <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi>, rather than numbers, to measure cowries, strongly supports the theory that they were used as money during the <name type="place">Shang</name> period. It is entirely unlikely that a set number of pieces should have become stipulated for such an ornament as a necklace. On the other hand, a real need to measure exact numbers of cowries would be present when they were being used as currency.</p>
               <p>There are controversial opinions on the number of cowries constituting a <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi>. Commenting on a <name type="place">Chou</name> ode which recounts a gift of one hundred <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries, Chüng Hsüan (127—200 A. D.) renders the number as five.<ref target="#CH3-n101">101</ref> Wang Kuo-wei rejects this number as inacceptable and on the basis of other literary evidence concludes that one <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi>
                  <pb n="85"/>
was made up of ten cowries, five on each string (correctly, on each end of the string). He regards Cheng Hsüan's number of five as being the amount on one end of the string, not the total number on both ends which constitute a complete <hi rend="italic">p'üng.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH3-n102">102</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> holds approximately the same opinion. He differs from Wang Kuo-wei only on the number in a <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> when cowries were originally used as ornaments. At that time, he contends, one <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> may have been made up of two, three or five. But he is inclined to accept Wang Kuo-wei's number of ten for the <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> as the unit of cowrie shells after they had been used as money.<ref target="#CH3-n103">103</ref> On the whole, <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo's</name> suggestion is very plausible. The <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> as a form of the cowrie necklace or the like must be distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> as the unit of the cowrie money. As <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> has pointed out, in the former case a definite number in a <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> is not essential, while in the latter case it is mandatory.</p>
               <p>So far the discussion of the <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> as the monetary unit of cowrie shells has overlooked one point which may be of some importance; that is, the standard size or weight of the ten pieces which made up the unit. Creel is of the opinion that, "These little shells are very much alike and there is every indication that one of them had the same value as another."<ref target="#CH3-n104">104</ref> With this assertion he declares, "A string of cowries, containing a fixed number, was a string of cowries."<ref target="#CH3-n105">105</ref> However, as we have already noted, the cowries excavated in <name type="place">China</name> now in the possession of The American Numismatic Society vary in size. Those recovered from the <name type="place">Chou</name> tombs in Hsin-Chüng, as reported by Chin Yün-o, are also of different sizes. "The largest are more than one inch (Chinese) long, while the smallest are less than one inch."<ref target="#CH3-n106">106</ref> Further, "big cowries" <hi rend="italic">(ta pei)</hi> are mentioned in one bronze inscription.<ref target="#CH3-n107">107</ref>
                  <pb n="86"/>
The American Museum of Natural History in <name type="place">New York</name> City has in its collection a large number of the <hi rend="italic">Cypraea moneta</hi> and C. <hi rend="italic">annulus</hi> to which species the money cowries of ancient <name type="place">China</name> belong. The largest of the former species is 43 mm. in length, and of the latter species 29 mm. The smallest specimens in both cases are less than 16 mm. It seems naive to assume that the ancient Chinese had regarded the cowrie shells of different sizes as of equal value. In 9 A. D. when the reformist emperor Wang Mang formulated his monetary system, which was intentionally modelled on the <name type="place">Chou</name> tradition as he understood it, he proclaimed cowrie shells to be money too. His shell money was of four classes according to their size. The larger the size, the larger the value. The first class was 0.48 <hi rend="italic">ch'ih</hi> or foot (110 mm.) long and over, the second class was 0.36 (82.8 mm.) and over, the third class was 0.24 (55.2 mm.) and over, and the fourth class was 0.12 (27.6 mm.). Those shorter than 0.06 (13.8 mm.) were not to be taken as money. In terms of the copper cash in circulation at the time, the values of the four classes of the cowrie shells were 216, 50, 30, and 10 respectively.<ref target="#CH3-n108">108</ref> How much the WangMang system does reflect the old <name type="place">Chou</name> traditions it is hard to say. But we may safely assume that during the <name type="place">Shang</name> and the <name type="place">Chou</name> periods one <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of large cowries must have been worth more than one <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of the smaller ones. The value of cowries as money presumably originated in their value as ornamental objects. As such the larger ones certainly are more attractive to the eye, and, if any magical effect was ascribed to them, the larger shells must have been deemed more powerful.</p>
               <p>As to the actual values of cowries during the <name type="place">Shang</name> and <name type="place">Chou</name> times we have no information except for the cost of the <hi rend="italic">tsun</hi> vessel made by Yüan, Lord of Chü. As noted above, the making of the vessel cost the noble fourteen <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries. From the style of the expression of the inscription on the vessel, part of which reads, "Used ten <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> and four <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries," Wu K'ai-shüng regards it as of an early origin, similar to that on the known <name type="place">Shang</name> bronzes. If it had been
<pb n="87"/>
later in origin, the part of the inscription quoted above would have been written as "Used ten and four <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries."<ref target="#CH3-n109">109</ref> If his judgment is correct, as we think it probably is, the vessel may be one of late <name type="place">Shang</name> or early <name type="place">Chou</name>.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, the present whereabouts of the vessel is not known. This deprives us of an important source of information from which we might have learned the approximate value of the cowries in Chinese antiquity. In his recent work, <hi rend="italic">The Bronzes of Shang and Chou</hi>, Jung Küng lists six <hi rend="italic">tsun</hi> for the <name type="place">Shang</name> period and two for early <name type="place">Chou</name>. They vary in size, ornamentation and probably also craftmanship. The largest is 1.21 Chinese feet high while the smallest is only 0.55.<ref target="#CH3-n110">110</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Although the exact value of cowries cannot be known, a general idea of their worth may be gathered from an examination of the bronze inscriptions in which grants of them are recorded. It is a well-known fact that no grant larger than ten <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> is recorded in the inscriptions of the preserved <name type="place">Shang</name> bronzes. The situation during the first 120 years of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period is the same. Only from King Mu (trad. 1001—952 B. C.) on, larger grants appear. The smallness of the amount of the grants is an indication of the rarity and dearness of cowrie shells at the time. In the inscription of the <hi rend="italic">kuei</hi> vessel made by Ling during the reign of King Wu,<ref target="#CH3-n111">111</ref> the founder of <name type="place">Chou</name> as a dynasty, Ling was granted ten <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries together with "ten families of <hi rend="italic">ch'ün</hi> (subjects) and one hundred <hi rend="italic">li</hi> (slaves)." The grant of such a small amount as ten <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> together with the grant of a large number of "subjects" and "slaves" indicates also the high value of the shells. The inscription on the <hi rend="italic">tsun</hi> vessel made by Ch'ien during the reign of King Ch'üng,<ref target="#CH3-n112">112</ref> son of King Wu, records that Ch'ien was granted five <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries on the occasion when he had a fief bestowed upon
<pb n="88"/>
him. The inscription on a <hi rend="italic">kuei</hi> vessel made by Su during the reign of the same king<ref target="#CH3-n113">113</ref> records that Su was exempted from further military service and granted "cowries" for his contribution in the campaign against the Eastern Barbarians. However, the number of <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> in the grant is not specified. Another minister who was exempted from military service is recorded in the inscription on a <hi rend="italic">ting</hi> made by Küng-ying during the reign of King K'ang (trad. 1078—1053 B.C.).<ref target="#CH3-n114">114</ref> It is also recorded that in addition to that great favor Küng-ying was granted ten <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries. Considering the circumstances under which the grants were made and the fact that the grants, however small in amount, were rewards to highly placed personages who had performed meritorious deeds, five or ten <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> of cowries must have been something which could match the dignity of both the benefactors and the beneficiaries. Since the cowrie shells were still of considerable value even during early <name type="place">Chou</name>, the generals who captured them in their military campaigns thought the event significant enough to cast bronze vessels in commemoration of the feat.<ref target="#CH3-n115">115</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the course of time, the Chinese empire of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period extended its borders further to the south and the southeast. This brought the <name type="place">Chou</name> people closer to the areas where cowries were produced and to the sea coasts whence they were obtained. As a result their import and their supplies of the shells increased. This may account for the grants of cowries in larger amounts of thirty, fifty and one hundred <hi rend="italic">p'üng</hi> as recorded in inscriptions of <name type="place">Chou</name> bronzes from the tenth century on. The increase in the amount of reward as the result in the increase in supplies foreshadowed the gradual decrease in the value of the shells. The trend of decrease in value was likely to have continued. Therefore, at the beginning of our era, or in 9 A. D. to be specific, the official value for a shell of the size of, or smaller than, 13.8 mm. in length was worth only three of the "Small Coins" then in circulation. One of the size of, or larger than, no mm. in length was worth no
<pb n="89"/>
more than 108.<ref target="#CH3-n116">116</ref> Four well preserved specimens of the "Small Coins" chosen from the collection of The American Numismatic Society measure 15 mm. in diameter and 1.5 mm. in thickness. Their weights range from 1.34 to 0.98 grams. The comparison of the size and weight of the "Small Coins" with the official value of the cowrie shell will give an idea of the worth of the shells in 9 A. D.</p>

                  <graphic url="NNM122_090a.jpg"/> (spade) and the <hi rend="italic">tao</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_090b.jpg"/> (knife).<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> The general belief is that the shape of the <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> coin is derived from that of an ancient agricultural tool, which had probably already been in use as a medium of exchange.</p>
               <p>Discoveries are known of agricultural implements of a shape similar to that of the <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> coin. Kuroda Kanichi reports the discovery of a bronze agricultural tool (<ref target="#fig-22">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 7</ref>), hereafter designated as Tool Kuroda, in Chüng-<name type="place">Chou</name>, <name type="place">Honan</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> He calls it a "bronze <hi rend="italic">t'ao,"</hi> but identifies it with the <hi rend="italic">ch'ien.</hi> Obviously he regards <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t'ao</hi> as two names for the same tool. The Tool Kuroda has a socket which extends onto the blade a third of its total length. A ridge runs down the middle of the lower part of the socket to the center of the blade. The upper part or the shoulders of the blade is narrow and rounded while its foot or cutting edge is broad and angular. Kuroda specifically notes that the cutting edge of the blade shows traces of having been used (in weeding or digging).<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> Converted into millimeters the measurements he gives for the tool are: length, 181.8; width of blade, 90.9; and thickness, 3.636. It weighs 97 Japanese <hi rend="italic">ryo</hi>, or 363.75 grams. Kuroda further observes that it is 21.21 mm. longer than the largest spade coins illustrated in <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'üan hui.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref>

Tool ANS. It is of bronze and is entirely covered with an aged patina. It also has a socket obviously to accommodate a wooden handle. Like that of Tool Kuroda the socket extends onto the blade and reaches as far as a third of its length. A vertical ridge runs in the center connecting the socket and the blade. Judging from the fact that the ridge starts where the hole of the socket ends, the ridge must have been made for reinforcing the handle. Like the Tool Kuroda, ours also has a hole through the socket, which is triangular in shape and completely pierces it. As suggested by Mr. <name type="pname">William L. Clark</name>, Curator of Mediaeval and Modem Coins at The American Numismatic Society, this hole may have been prepared for the insertion of a metal wedge, a wooden pin, a thread, or leather strap to secure the wooden handle in the socket.</p>
               <p>On the whole the tool appears rectangular. Its shoulders are square and thick, while its cutting edge is much thinner and somewhat rounded in shape. This must have been the result of long use, which is indicated by the fact that one side of the cutting edge has been worn off much more than the other. The measurements of the tool in millimeters are as follows: length, 123; shoulder width, 84; foot width, 85; thickness of shoulder, 3.5; thickness at foot, 0.5.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 8</ref>) hereafter designated as Tool <name type="pname">Nishimura</name>, which is longer, has slightly raised shoulders and a curved cutting edge which is slightly concave. The details of its surface are not clear in the reproduction. There appears to be a socket, though the outlines of that part of the blade are blurred. In all probability its structural features may be the same as those of Tool Kuroda and Tool ANS. Unfortunately, <name type="pname">Nishimura</name> does not furnish informative details, nor does he give measurements. In shape it differs markedly from both Tool Kuroda and Tool ANS in that its shoulders are raised and its cutting edge is concave. Although it

probably performed the same function as the other tools, it must be a variety from another locality and for that reason, might have a different or local name.</p>
               <p>A comparison of the early types of the spade coins with these two types of the ancient agricultural tools reveals a striking resemblance between the money and the implement. The <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'üan hui</hi> has a few wood block illustrations from drawings of the early spade coins, which are supposedly reproduced in original size. In volume <hi rend="italic">yüan</hi>, pp. 12a and 13a—13b, there are two specimens (we shall designate them as specimens A and B respectively) which are not inscribed, a sign of early origin. As illustrated, both have a socket, which, like that on the tool, extends onto the blade and reaches about a third of the blade's length. The width of the shoulders is slightly narrower than that of the foot. The following are their measurements:</p>

               <p>Specimen A resembles very much the "prototype spade coin" which was reported in the possession of the Imperial Museum of Japan and is illustrated by Irita Seizo in his article dealing with the origin of the shapes of spade and knife coins.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> (A reproduction of the illustration is found on <ref target="#fig-26">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 1</ref>). The design of this "prototype spade coin" resembles the features of the ancient tool in every detail. Its measurements, converted into millimeters are: total length, 160.59; shoulder width, 83.931; foot width, 98.475. Its socket (handle) is short, a feature in which it strongly resembles Specimen A. It differs from the latter only in the fact that the edges of the two sides of the blade curve inward and flare out slightly at the bottom.</p>

               <p>The American Numismatic Society has an early bronze spade coin (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV), which is in perfect condition save for three small holes which no doubt were incidentally perforated later. Its socket (hollow handle) is short like the one in the Imperial Museum of Japan. The length of the socket on the blade is extraordinarily long, reaching the center of the blade. Its shoulders, which are not round like those of Tool Kuroda, slant at the ends. Its foot (cutting edge) has two pointed tips, which constitute its unique feature. Otherwise, it looks like the other specimens described above. Its measurements are:</p>

               <p>The specimens recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'üan hut</hi>, especially Specimen A, may not have been made as coins. Considering their shape and their large size it is not impossible that they may have been made as tools. However, as the demarcation line between the tool and the coin which gradually developed from it is naturally obscure, any categorical definition as to their specific functions without actual examination of the objects is inadvisable. The specimen in The American Numismatic Society does not present these difficulties. The smallness of its body and the two extra pointed tips at its foot exclude the practicability of its use in the fields. There appears no doubt that it is one of the early, or prototype, spade coins.</p>
               <p>As time went on, further changes in design and the size of this type of early Chinese coins occurred. Their size became smaller and smaller, and their body thinner and thinner (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VII—X for examples). Although they retain the socket, it no longer projects onto the blade but ends at the shoulders of the blade. The portion of the socket above the blade is short, whereas that of the coins is comparatively much longer and appears more like a handle. While the blade of the tool is thicker at its shoulders and thinner at its cutting edge (foot),
<pb n="94"/>
the blade of the coins is of the same thinness throughout. Thus, we see that the spade coins lost all of the functional features of the original spade.</p>
               <p>Though the spade coins have functionally deviated from the original tool to a marked degree, their design faithfully preserves the appearance of the tool. All the hollow-handle spade coins bear three vertical lines on both sides. The central line is an imitation of the reinforcing ridge, and the two lines on its sides are reminiscent of the two edges of the extension of the socket into the blade.</p>
               <p>This same observation holds true for the flat-shoulder-flat-foot hollow-handle spades (H. H. Spade II) as well as the raised-shoulder-pointed-foot hollow-handle spades (H. H. Spade I), both of which are early coins. The first type seems to be a direct descendant of the farming tools represented by Tool Kuroda and Tool ANS, while the second appears to be that of the tools represented by Tool <name type="pname">Nishimura</name>. Thus we may conclude that the <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> (spade) coin of ancient <name type="place">China</name> developed out of an agricultural tool from which its shape and design are derived.</p>
               <p>Now we must try to explain why the coin was called <hi rend="italic">pu.</hi> Since the coin designated as <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> developed from an agricultural tool, it is natural to assume that <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> must have been the name of this tool. <hi rend="italic">Pu</hi>, however, is not found as a name for an agricultural tool in the literature of the <name type="place">Chou</name> period. Apart from being a name for a money the term <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> is used regularly to denote a textile. As has been admirably explained by Wu Ch'üng-shih, a famous scholar in Chinese classics, this textile, a material for everday clothing, was made from the fibre of the <hi rend="italic">kü</hi> plant and hemp.<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> There is no reason whatsoever for <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> as the name of fibre cloth to have become by semantic transfer the name for money.</p>
               <p>Although we do not find <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> as the name for an agricultural tool in the historical records, we do have the character <hi rend="italic">po</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_094a.jpg"/> used in this sense. In the Ch'ün-kung ode preserved in the <hi rend="italic">Shih ching</hi> (Book of Odes) peasants are instructed to "prepare <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">po</hi>" for their
<pb n="95"/>
work in the field.<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref> According to Hsü Shün of the first century A. D. "field tools" or "farming tools" were among the meanings for both the characters <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">po</hi> in his day.<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref> His explanations are corroborated by Chüng Hsüan's (127—200) comments on the ode referred to above. Specifically Cheng Hsüan identifies <hi rend="italic">po</hi> with <hi rend="italic">lu</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_095a.jpg"/> a tool for weeding. In the Liang-Ssǔ ode, which is also found in the <hi rend="italic">Shih ching, po</hi> is used to signify a weeding tool.<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref> As the implements which we have discussed above seem to be well suited for weeding we may justifiably identify <hi rend="italic">po</hi> with the tool from which the <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> coin developed. But why was the coin not called <hi rend="italic">po</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> whick is a different character? In this, as in many other instances in Chinese philology, we may find the answer by resorting to one of the basic principles of ancient Chinese linguistics: characters of the same sound can be used interchangeably.</p>
               <p>Etymologically speaking, the character <hi rend="italic">po</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_095c.jpg"/> being signic-phonetic (the radical <graphic url="NNM122_095d.jpg"/> for metal is its signic and <graphic url="NNM122_095e.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NNM122_095ee.jpg"/> is its phonetic) is of late origin. Its early or original form is <graphic url="NNM122_095f.jpg"/> (pronounced <hi rend="italic">fu</hi> today). The form of <graphic url="NNM122_095g.jpg"/> as it appears in the bronze inscriptions of the <name type="place">Shang</name> and the <name type="place">Chou</name> periods is reminiscent of the picture of the agricultural tool we have described.<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref> When later the character <hi rend="italic">po</hi> was formed, <graphic url="NNM122_095h.jpg"/> became its phonetic, and consequently its basic component part. Because <graphic url="NNM122_095i.jpg"/> has <graphic url="NNM122_095ii.jpg"/>as its basic (phonetic) element and consequently is pronounced the same as the latter, <graphic url="NNM122_095j.jpg"/> could be replaced by <graphic url="NNM122_095k.jpg"/> Thus we find that in the inscriptions on the early bronzes <graphic url="NNM122_095l.jpg"/> is actually used as a substitute for <graphic url="NNM122_095m.jpg"/>
                  <ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref> For the same reason, in the inscription of the Ch'u-kung Po, <graphic url="NNM122_095n.jpg"/> is written <graphic url="NNM122_095o.jpg"/>

<pb n="96"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">pu</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_096a.jpg"/> the name of the spade coin as found in literature. The result is that <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> could be used for <graphic url="NNM122_096b.jpg"/> the original form of the character <hi rend="italic">po</hi>, the name of the agricultural tool. Even at a much later time, in the literature of the Han period, <graphic url="NNM122_096c.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM122_096cc.jpg"/> are still used interchangeably. <graphic url="NNM122_096d.jpg"/> which is another form for <graphic url="NNM122_096e.jpg"/> in the <hi rend="italic">Shi-chi</hi> is replaced by <graphic url="NNM122_096f.jpg"/> in the <hi rend="italic">Han shu.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref> The name for door decoration is written <graphic url="NNM122_096g.jpg"/> and also <graphic url="NNM122_096h.jpg"/>

Since <hi rend="italic">pu</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_096m.jpg"/> was used for <graphic url="NNM122_096n.jpg"/> it could and must have been used for <hi rend="italic">po</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_096o.jpg"/> As far as we can see, this is probably the way in which <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> came to be a substitute for <hi rend="italic">po</hi>, which was the name of an agricultural tool and must have been also the name of the coin that developed from such a tool.</p>
               <p>It must be noted, however, that in the ode quoted above, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> is mentioned along with <hi rend="italic">po.</hi> There is no doubt that <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> was also a farming tool, which Chüng Hsüan in his comment on that ode identifies with <hi rend="italic">t'ao</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_096p.jpg"/> Etymologically speaking, <hi rend="italic">t'ao</hi> is also a signicphonetic character, and therefore is late in origin. The character has the same basic structural part <graphic url="NNM122_096q.jpg"/> and the same sound as the character <graphic url="NNM122_096r.jpg"/> signifying "clam" or "clam shell." In ancient <name type="place">China</name>, the clam shell was also called <hi rend="italic">ch'ün</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chün</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_096s.jpg"/> In remote antiquity the Chinese are said to have "ground clam shells (<hi rend="italic">ch'üin</hi>) with which they weeded."<ref target="#CH4-n15">15</ref> For this reason both the character <hi rend="italic">lu</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_096t.jpg"/> meaning a "weeding tool" or "to weed," and the character <hi rend="italic">nung</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_096u.jpg"/> meaning "farming" or "to farm," have <hi rend="italic">ch'ün</hi> as their fundamental component part.<ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref> Thus the farming tool must have been also a tool for weeding. As the name of a weeding tool <hi rend="italic">t'ao</hi> is found in many passages
<pb n="97"/>
in the literature of the Chou period.<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref> Since <hi rend="italic">t'ao</hi> is identified with <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> by <name type="pname">Chüng Hsüan</name>, the latter is to be understood also as the name of a weeding tool.</p>
               <p>What is perplexing is the fact that in the literature of or concerning the Chou period <hi rend="italic">ch'ien,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">pu (po),</hi> is also found to be a designation of certain money.<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref> As far as the coins (which are preserved by tens of thousands) show, the money referred to are the spades. Thus we find both <hi rend="italic">pu (po)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> as appellations for spade coins.</p>
               <p>How do we explain this seemingly confusing situation? In order to clarify the confusion in terminology, we must come back once again to the tools and the two different types of hollow-handle spade coins described above. In the description of the farming tools we have shown two different types. One type, represented by Tool <name type="pname">Kuroda</name> and Tool ANS, has either slanted or square shoulders and a flat foot (cutting edge). The other, represented by Tool Nishimura, has raised shoulders and a concave foot. The existence of the two different shapes of tools is paralleled by the existence of two different shaped hollow-handle spade coins which were developed from these tools. One type of the hollow-handle spade coins (designated as H. H. Spade I in the following text) is marked by raised and pointed shoulders and pointed feet (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI), and the other (designated as H. H. Spade II) is characterized by flat or square shoulders and flat or mildly curved feet (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VII—IX). There is no indication or possibility that one type was a variety of the other. These two differently shaped early spade coins must have been local varieties developed from two differently shaped tools. This point is confirmed by the discovery of the ancient tools described above, whose characteristic features can still be seen in the designs of the coins. One type of tool must have been called <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> from which the spade coin designated as <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi>
                  <pb n="98"/>
                  <pb n="99"/>
developed, and the other must have been called <hi rend="italic">po (pu)</hi> from which the spade coin designated as <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> developed. Only by such an understanding of the monetary terms, can we comprehend the statement of Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien that ancient Chinese coins, as far as the spades are concerned, "were either the <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">pu"</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref>
               </p>
               <p>To determine which type was the <hi rend="italic">po (pu)</hi> and which the <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> is difficult. There is, however, indirect evidence which may be of some aid in solving the problem: the names and forms of the musical bells of the Chou period. The bells which are preserved are of two types which when viewed from the side appear in the shapes <graphic url="NNM122_108a.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM122_108b.jpg"/>. They are designated as <hi rend="italic">chung</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_108c.jpg"/> and <hi rend="italic">po</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_108d.jpg"/> respectively.<ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref> The muscial bell <hi rend="italic">po</hi> may have been so called because of its resemblance to the farming tool <hi rend="italic">po</hi>.</p>
               <p>The distinctive features of the two types of spades attracted the attention of Ch'ün Chieh-ch'i, a noted numismatist of the last century who remarked that the spades with a flat foot are called <hi rend="italic">po</hi> and that those with a pointed (or, in his words, "not flat<hi rend="sup">,,</hi>) foot are called <hi rend="italic">ch'ün.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref>
                  </hi> He also refers to the shape of the <hi rend="italic">po</hi> bell as evidence. If Ch'ün Chieh-ch'i's observation is correct, then Tool Nishimura, from which the raised-shoulder-pointed-foot spades appear to have developed, must have been called <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi>, and Tool <name type="pname">Kuroda</name> and Tool ANS, from which the flat-shoulder-square-foot spades appear to have been developed, must have been called <hi rend="italic">po.</hi> It is significant that when the
<pb n="100"/>
term <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> had become an exclusive name for money, the agricultural tool which probably was originally called <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> was designated solely as <hi rend="italic">t'ao.</hi> At the same time the term <hi rend="italic">pu,</hi> which was originally a borrowed character for <hi rend="italic">po,</hi> a tool, became a special term for the spade coin. All indications point to the fact that because of the growing importance of the tool-money and because of the increasing deviation in their design from the original tools, there seemed to have been a tacit practice among the ancient Chinese to give these money types exclusive appellations. Thus <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> became the conventional terms for the tool-money, and <hi rend="italic">t'ao</hi> and <hi rend="italic">po</hi> for the tools.<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref> In one case the tool was given a completely different name, and in the other the money appropriated the borrowed term, <hi rend="italic">pu</hi>. In a way this terminological evolution for the spade coin illustrates the early history of Chinese coinage.<ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref>
               </p>
               <p>One more point can be noted in connection with the terms <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">po.</hi> At the end of the Chou period, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> seems to have been used
<pb n="101"/>
in a much broader sense than <hi rend="italic">pu.</hi> While <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> designates only the spade coin, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> appears to denote money of all types, including the spade. On account of this, when the round coins appeared in the third century B. C. they were also called <hi rend="italic">ch'ien,</hi> but never <hi rend="italic">pu.</hi> Today, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> is still being used to mean money in general.<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref>

                  <p>Both T'ang Lan and Kuo Mo-jo hold the opposite opinion.

Actually the appellations of the music bells has been a problem of uncertainty for many centuries. This uncertainty seems to have grown out of the confusion with which the terms were used when some of the late bells were cast. At this time the people appeared to have forgotten the original distinction between the two types of bells as implied in their two designations, <hi rend="italic">chung</hi> and <hi rend="italic">po</hi>, and some named the bells indiscriminately. This is probably the reason which led Jung Küng to the conclusion that there are no differences between the <hi rend="italic">po</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">chung (<name type="pname">Shang</name> Chou i-ch'i t'ung k'ao</hi>, I, 495).</p>

                  <p>There are two other explanations of the origin of the monetary term <hi rend="italic">pu,</hi> which, however unconvincing, must be noted. One theory, advanced by two Japanese scholars, is that the term <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> evolved from the name of the ancient Chinese ax, which is <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_109a.jpg"/> according to <name type="pname">Kuroda Kanichi</name>(<name type="pname">Kuroda</name>, <hi rend="italic">Kōkogaku zasshi,</hi> XVI (1926), 141) and <hi rend="italic">fu</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_109b.jpg"/> according to <name type="pname">Tanaka Keibun</name> quoted by <name type="pname">Nishimura Shinji</name> (<hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>, Vol. I, 30). The reason <name type="pname">Tanaka</name> identifies <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> with <hi rend="italic">fu</hi> is that <hi rend="italic">fu</hi> has a "common origin" with <hi rend="italic">po</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_109c.jpg"/>, from which the <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> coin developed. <name type="pname">Nishimura's</name> quotation of <name type="pname">Tanaka's</name> explanation may not have been sufficiently adequate. As it is, we cannot understand why <name type="pname">Tanaka</name> should approach the problem indirectly through <hi rend="italic">fu</hi> to <hi rend="italic">po</hi> and not directly as we have. What caused <name type="pname">Kuroda</name> to trace the origin of the term <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> to <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> is that the character <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> appears in the legend on Old Spade coins (those coined after the hollow-handled spades). The difficulty with <name type="pname">Kuroda's</name> explanation is that philologically speaking <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> has nothing to do with <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> (ax), and he does not seem to have found it necessary to offer an explanation.<lb/>
The other theory advanced by <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name>, a Chinese numismatist, in his article on the origin and evolution of monetary terms (<hi rend="italic">Ch'üan-pi</hi>, No. 22, 6—9), is that the spade coin was named <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> (which term he understands as cloth) because the royal treasury of Chou had collected cloth as its revenue. He concedes, however, that his interpretation has no bearing on the original name of the coin.</p>

               <head>2. THE DATE OF THE COINAGE</head>
               <p>The dating of the beginning of Chinese coinage is one of the most controversial problems in Chinese numismatics. Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien (145—86 (?) B. C.) places its appearance as early as the legendary Yü and
<pb n="102"/>
the semi-legendary <name type="pname">Hsia</name> dynasties.<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref> Some Sung scholars attributed the spade coinage to even more remote pre-historical figures. Though modern numismatists and historians are more realistic, their opinions diverge considerably. Our own immediate concern is with the dating of the spades. Of the various theories advanced concerning them, the following may be regarded as representative.</p>
               <p>1. <name type="pname">Hsia</name> and <name type="pname">Shang</name> dynasties (ending 1122 B. C., traditional date). Among the modern numismatists <name type="pname">Lacouperie</name> appears to be of this opinion.<ref target="#CH4-n26">26</ref> Though he does not categorically commit himself to such an early date for Chinese coinage, one gets this impression from his introductory remarks on spade coinage. As a specimen of the spade coinage of this period he gives a hollow-handle spade with raised or pointed shoulders and pointed foot.</p>
               <p>2. Western Chou (1122—771 B. C.).</p>
               <p>Numismatists and historians who subscribe to this opinion are many. <name type="pname">Chüng Chia</name>-hsiang may be taken as their representative.<ref target="#CH4-n27">27</ref> He arrives at this date from three considerations. First, the Western Chou had already had a "fully developed governmental organization." "Because of the necessity to collect pecuniary fines and taxes, copper money was made." Secondly, the epigraphical style of the coin legends on the spades is that of the so-called "great seal character," which is the style of script of the Western Chou period. Thirdly, the money which was used during the Western Chou period was the <hi rend="italic">ch'üan</hi> which were the spade and the knife coins.</p>
               <p>3. End of the Ch'un-ch'iu period (770—481 B. C.).</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Ojima Sukema</name> may be regarded as the exponent of this theory.<ref target="#CH4-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="103"/>
               <p>His basic arguments are: (1) that the historical records of or concerning the Western Chou and the Ch'un-ch'iu period show that a natural economy prevailed at that time; (2) that literary sources show that a money economy did not develop until the Chan-kuo period (403—221 B. C.). The literary sources he used are <hi rend="italic">Tso chuan, Kuo yü</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chan-kuo ts'ü.</hi> Though <hi rend="italic">Kuo yü</hi> contains a story that <name type="pname">King Ching</name> of Chou made "big coins" in 524 B. C., he doubts its authenticity.</p>
               <p>4. The Chan-kuo period (403—221 B. C.).</p>
               <p>The scholar who holds this opinion is <name type="pname">Li Chien-nung</name>. In his article dealing with the development of the monetary system before Ch'in (221—207 B. C.)<ref target="#CH4-n29">29</ref> he observes that as late as the Ch'un-ch'iu period the Chinese still practiced a barter economy or "exchange in kind." Therefore he states that spades and knives became circulating currency after the commencement of the Chan-kuo period. The historical materials which he used were those used by <name type="pname">Ojima</name>. He also rejects the story of the casting of "big coins" by <name type="pname">King Ching</name> as unhistorical.</p>
               <p>The faulty logic of some of <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang's</name> arguments and his error in interpreting the meaning of <hi rend="italic">ch'üan</hi> are obvious.<ref target="#CH4-n30">30</ref> It may be mentioned in passing, however, that he is the only one of the above four who made use of any evidence from the coins themselves. Whereas <name type="pname">Lacouperie</name> used one coin specimen to illustrate his point, that specimen, being late in date, had no actual bearing on his theory. He and the others based their conclusions entirely on literary evidence.</p>
               <p>Basically, the ancient historical literature of <name type="place">China</name> is political in nature and is generally terse inform; it contains little regarding
<pb n="104"/>
contemporary economic life. It has not been completely preserved; what we have of it today is in fact only a small part. Therefore, any insistence on the non-existence of things unmentioned in such a limited amount of annalistic records is bound to be untenable, and, in many cases, untrue. For example, the Ch'u state of the Chou period was never reported as having money of its own. Today, however, we have <hi rend="italic">Yüan-chin</hi> money which has been unearthed in central <name type="place">China</name>.</p>
               <p>In their use of the literary sources, the scholars have, moreover, failed to observe the rudimentary principle of first examining the nature of the data. <name type="pname">Li Chien-nung</name> states that he selected about eighty passages from the <hi rend="italic">Tso chuan</hi> which refer to "forms of property" in none of which is there mention of either spade or knife coins.<ref target="#CH4-n31">31</ref> According to Li, twenty of these passages concern bribery, twenty-nine awards and gifts, nine offers in expectation of favors asked for, nine seizure of one noble's property by another, and seven wealth in general. Significantly, however, <name type="pname">Li Chien-nung</name> fails to note either the status of the men who are involved in the events or the nature of the events related in his passages. We may say briefly that the objects which he calls "forms of property" are limited to those which could be exchanged among the nobles as presents and the possession of which alone was regarded at the time as respected symbols of wealth. Thus the usual objects of the grants of the king to the feudal lords and the presents exchanged among the latter are jade, silk and silk embroidery, carriages and horses, slaves, gold. When the wealth of a noble is mentioned, it is expressed in terms of the number of horses and carriages he used in his equippage. How much money was in his treasury and how much grain in his granary were matters of secondary importance. The objects which one noble lord tried to seize from his rivals in war were territory, crops, weapons, war horses, and sacrificial bronze vessels — the symbol of the authority of a state. Jade has been mentioned as trophy, but it is always an important or famous piece, the possession of which
<pb n="105"/>
has been too often a cause of conflict. Even as late as the Han time the imperial grants which were given actually in copper cash were usually expressed in terms of gold. To give money as a present is still frowned upon by the Chinese. Any suggestion that the objects offered as gifts in an aristocratic society are the only "forms of property" and thereupon that money does not exist is largely due to an inadequate understanding of the social and psychological aspects of the property valued by the nobility.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tso chuan</hi>, moreover, which is relied upon by both <name type="pname">Ojima</name> and <name type="pname">Li Chien-nung</name> as their authority for the denial of the existence of money during the Ch'un-ch'iu period is not completely devoid of the mention of the spade coin. A passage in the <hi rend="italic">Tso chuan</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH4-n32">32</ref> relates that in 517 B. C. the prince of Lu, <name type="pname">Duke Chao</name>, was forced to flee to Ch'i by three noble families who competed with him for power. In the next year, 516 B. C., <name type="pname">Duke Ching</name> of Ch'i tried to return <name type="pname">Duke Chao</name> to his state and instructed his minister <name type="pname">Tzŭ-yu</name>, who was to carry out the plan, not to accept bribery from the nobles of Lu lest the plan be sabotaged. Two officials from one of the three families which expelled <name type="pname">Duke Chao</name> promised Kao I, an assistant to <name type="pname">Tzŭ-yu</name>, generous political and property compensations if he could bribe and dissuade his superior from carrying out the order. Kao I showed the silk embroidery which he received from the emissaries of the noble family of Lu to <name type="pname">Tzŭ-yu</name>, and he desired to have it. Then Kao I said to <name type="pname">Tzŭ-yu</name>, "To buy this the Lu people pay one <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> (spade coin) for one hundred bolts." indicating that the noble families of Lu could procure with ease (at a very low price) large quantities of the silk embroidery to be offered to <name type="pname">Tzŭ-yu</name> if he should help them realize their wishes. Kao I's statement in quotation marks is a verbal translation of the Chinese text, and the only acceptable one possible from the grammatical construction of the sentences and the meaning
<pb n="106"/>
implied therein. While Hui Tung (1697—1758) and Hung Liang-chi (1746—1809), both of whom are famous scholars in the field of Chinese classics and history and have studied the <hi rend="italic">Tso chuan</hi> in particular, agree with our interpretation,<ref target="#CH4-n33">33</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Shün Ch'in-han</name> (1775—1831) finds it objectionable on the ground that the price for the silk embroidery is too low.<ref target="#CH4-n34">34</ref> He offers an interpretation in which the character <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> means <hi rend="italic">tsu</hi> (accumulation, pile). In the end this interpretation agrees with the one advanced by Tu Yu (222—284), who understands <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> as meaning <hi rend="italic">ch'ün</hi> (to display, to exhibit).<ref target="#CH4-n35">35</ref> In his translation <name type="pname">James Legge</name> renders the passage thus, "the people of Loo (Lu) had bought such silk, made up in 1000 pieces."<ref target="#CH4-n36">36</ref> This constitutes a third interpretation. But his translation does not agree with the Chinese text. Tu Yu and <name type="pname">Shün Ch'in-han's</name> explanation is unnatural and incongruous with the idea which the author tries to convey. The objection of <name type="pname">Shün Ch'in-han</name> to our interpretation would have some validity were it not for the fact that the question of price is not important. Understandably, Kao I's statement must have been grossly exaggerated in his eagerness to convince his superior that bribes could be provided easily and in large quantities."<ref target="#CH4-n37">37</ref>In the text, "to buy <hi rend="italic">(mai)"</hi> is the action, and "the spade coin <hi rend="italic">(pu)"<hi rend="sup"/>
                  </hi>is the means with which the action of buying is consumated. The idea is clearly expressed. It is difficult to understand how <name type="pname">Li Chien-nung</name>, and for that matter, <name type="pname">Ojima</name> too, missed the passage.</p>
               <p>If they have missed the mention of <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> money in the <hi rend="italic">Tso chuan</hi>, they should not have overlooked that in the <hi rend="italic">Li chi,</hi> a Chinese classic. There <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> money is mentioned in two passages as funeral gifts. These passages are found in the T'an-kung chapter which is an authentic historical
<pb n="107"/>
record for the Ch'un-ch'iu period. In both cases the authoritative Han commentator <name type="pname">Chüng Hsüan</name> (127—200) specifically notes that <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> was money.<ref target="#CH4-n38">38</ref> Judging from their failure to use these important historical data, we can but draw the conclusion that <name type="pname">Ojima</name> and <name type="pname">Li Chien-nung</name> have not exhausted the very source of information on which they have relied in their studies.</p>
               <p>As a matter of fact the spade <hi rend="italic">(pu)</hi> as money appeared in a much earlier record. The record is the ode of Mang in the <hi rend="italic">Shih ching.</hi> In this ode a girl sings of her suitor</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>A simple-looking lad you were,</l>
                  <l>Carrying <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> (spades) to exchange for silk.</l>
                  <l>But you came not so to purchase silk;</l>
                  <l>You came to make proposals to me.<ref target="#CH4-n39">39</ref>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>In date this ode cannot be later than the sixth century B. C. The character <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> in this ode is given by both <name type="pname">Chüng Chung</name> and <name type="pname">Chüng Hsüan</name> of the Han dynasty as meaning <hi rend="italic">pi</hi> (money).<ref target="#CH4-n40">40</ref> But some modern scholars, for reasons not specified, have disregarded these early commentaries and interpreted it as meaning "cloth." In their translations of the ode <name type="pname">James Legge</name>, Author <name type="pname">Waley</name>, and <name type="pname">Bernard Karlgren</name> express the same unwarranted opinion.<ref target="#CH4-n41">41</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Ojima</name> and <name type="pname">Li Chien-nung</name> subscribe to this explanation, and use it to prove their thesis that at the time the ode was composed there existed an economy of "exchange in kind."</p>
               <p>In the discussion above we have demonstrated that the term <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> was used as a common noun for cloth or textile; it denotes, however, only the cloth made of grass fibre such as the <hi rend="italic">kü</hi> plant and hemp. (See p. 94). Such cloth is inferior in quality and coarse in workmanship. If it is used as a denominative meaning a kind of textile as expressed in the term <hi rend="italic">tsui pu</hi> (felt), it also implies an ordinary material. If the love-seeking boy who pretends to be a merchant
<pb n="108"/>
had brought cloth with him to exchange for silk, he could not have "carried it in his arms in front of his chest" as the verb <hi rend="italic">pao</hi> implies. It would be not only cumbersome but also inconvenient to carry the large amount necessary to purchase a much finer and more treasured textile, silk. But if we follow the commentary of the Han scholars who were closer to the old tradition than modern scholars and understand the term <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> as meaning spade coins, then there is no difficulty in understanding the verb <hi rend="italic">pao.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to Lo Chün-yü, an astute collector of archaeological objects and ancient coins, some of the unearthed hollow-handle spade coins which he saw were fastened together at their handles with a cord.<ref target="#CH4-n42">42</ref> Kuo Pao-chün reports to the author that the hollow-handle spades which he discovered in the Chou tombs in Chi County, <name type="place">Honan</name>, were also fastened together, though the number in a bundle varies. In actual use, the spades might have been kept together in the same manner. In a story recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Han-fei-tzŭ,</hi> a woman in the state of Wei, where the ode of Mang originated, is said to have plead with Heaven that she be granted "one hundred bundles (<hi rend="italic">shu)</hi> of spades (<hi rend="italic">pu</hi>)."<ref target="#CH4-n43">43</ref> This story implies not only that spade coins were bound together in actual use but also that there were a definite number in each bundle.</p>
               <p>The modem scholars' unwarranted disregard for early commentaries and their misunderstanding of <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> in these particular cases as meaning "cloth" is further illustrated by their explanation of a passage in the <hi rend="italic">Mo-tzŭ.</hi> In this passage Mo Ti (480—390 (?) B. C.), a philosopher, is quoted as saying, "The gentlemen <hi rend="italic">(shih)</hi> of today in making available their personal services take even less care than the merchants in putting to employment <hi rend="italic">i pu</hi> (one spade)".<ref target="#CH4-n44">44</ref> The meaning of the phrase <hi rend="italic">i pu</hi> is so clear that no other interpretation is possible. However, unfamiliar with the ancient Chinese coinage and doggedly believing that the people of late Chou still used cloth as a medium of exchange, some modern scholars read <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> in this passage
<pb n="109"/>
also as meaning "cloth." Equivocation may be tolerated in a direct quotation in Chinese of this passage, but in translating it into a foreign language such as English, one must be specific. Facing this difficult situation Yi-pao Mei interpolates the original text rather than seek for a correct interpretation; in his translation of the passage, he has inserted the word "bale" between the two characters of the phrase <hi rend="italic">i pu,</hi> and rendered it as "one bale of cloth."<ref target="#CH4-n45">45</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Taking the ode of Mang as our authority, we may say that, as far as literary information on the spade goes, the coin must have become an ordinary medium of exchange before the sixth century B. C. or earlier. But this date is not to be taken as the date of the commencement of the spade coinage which in all probability must have been much earlier.</p>
               <p>In his statement on the early history of Chinese coinage Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien (145—86? B. C.), China's earliest great historian, says, "With the opening of exchange between farmers, artisans and merchants, there came into use money of tortoise shells, cowrie shells, gold, the <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> spade, the knives, and the <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> spade. This has been so from remote antiquity."<ref target="#CH4-n46">46</ref> A statement such as this is too general to be of any use for numismatists. In his historical account of the Chinese monetary system Pan Ku excludes the <name type="pname">Hsia</name> and the <name type="pname">Shang</name> periods for lack of information, and starts with the Chou dynasty <ref target="#CH4-n47">47</ref>He fails also to give any specific date. Since the Chou period covers some eight hundred years, it is too long a period to be spoken of in general terms. Stories such as those concerning Yü of the <name type="pname">Hsia</name> dynasties and T'ang of the <name type="pname">Shang</name> dynasty, who are said to have coined money in the second millenium B. C., lack historical authenticity and consequently must be discarded.</p>
               <p>In the absence of literary information we must resort to archaeology which, unfortunately, for the reasons we have stated in the introduction, offers little help. The only spade coins which were scientifically recovered are those found by <name type="pname">Kuo Pao-chün</name> (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi>
                  <pb n="110"/>
VII, 1). He dated the tombs in which these spades were discovered as of about 270 B.C. However, as Mr. <name type="pname">Kuo</name> points out, the spades found are apparently mortuary money especially made for the purpose of burial. They are extraordinarily thin, small and without legend (monetary spades of the same small size are of late origin and always bear a legend). As mortuary money they were not necessarily modelled in shape and design on contemporary money. More likely they represented a money of days long past like the paper horse-shoe silver burnt by modern Chinese on sacrificial occasions which imitates silver ingots long out of circulation.</p>
               <p>Of the many thousand bronze inscriptions of the Chou period, we find three have the character <hi rend="italic">pu.</hi> In one, the Shou-kung Tsun inscription, it appears as the component part of the term <hi rend="italic">tsui pu</hi>, a felt made of animal hair. In the other two it appears as an independent term and may mean spade coins. One of these is found in duplicate on the body and cover of a <hi rend="italic">yu</hi> vessel made by <name type="pname">Yüan</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n48">48</ref>The other is found on a <hi rend="italic">tsun</hi> vessel also made by <name type="pname">Yüan</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n49">49</ref> With its first line lost the rest of the inscription varies only slightly in wording from the inscription on the <hi rend="italic">yu</hi> vessel. There is no doubt that both the <hi rend="italic">yu</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tsun</hi> vessels and the inscriptions thereon were made by the same <name type="pname">Yüan</name> as memorials for the same event. The inscription on the <hi rend="italic">yu</hi> vessel reads:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>In the nineteenth year, the King was in Han. <name type="pname">Wang Chiang</name>

                  <l>(the queen) ordered Scribe <name type="pname">Yüan</name> to pacify</l>
                  <l>the ruler of the I (barbarians). The ruler of the</l>

                  <l>made this precious vessel in honor of his father Kuei.<ref target="#CH4-n50">50</ref>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <pb n="111"/>
               <p>Yü Hsing-wu, so far as we know, is the only epigraphical scholar who has commented on the character <hi rend="italic">pu,</hi> and he lists two meanings for it, <hi rend="italic">p'i po</hi> or "bolt of silk" and <hi rend="italic">pi</hi> or "money."<ref target="#CH4-n51">51</ref> In Chou literature <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> is susceptible to two explanations, cloth or spade coin, depending on the context. As a term for cloth it denotes the coarse cloth made of <hi rend="italic">kü</hi> and hemp only. As late as the Han time it still denotes a cloth made of <hi rend="italic">i<ref target="#CH4-n52">52</ref>
                  </hi> which is hemp fibre.<ref target="#CH4-n53">53</ref> Furthermore, in Chou bronze inscriptions the silk fabrics granted by the king or by a noble to his inferior are either called <hi rend="italic">ssŭ</hi> (silk) or <hi rend="italic">po</hi> (silk fabrics)<ref target="#CH4-n54">54</ref> and nowhere are they called <hi rend="italic">pu</hi>. We may, therefore, reject the interpretation of <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> as meaning silk fabric.</p>
               <p>Can we then regard the character <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> in this inscription as signifying fibre cloth? This seems also unlikely. The inscription states clearly that the donor of the cowries and the <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> is a ruler of a state even though the state is of a non-Chou origin<ref target="#CH4-n55">55</ref> The recipient of the presents is a Scribe <hi rend="italic">(tso ts'ü),</hi> who, as one in charge of composing and transmitting royal decrees, was an important official of the court of Chou. It seems rather improbable that the presents offered by a state's ruler to a high minister of the court of Chou would consist of ordinary fibre cloth. If it had been a special kind of cloth, worthy of conveying special respect and deserving special consideration, it would have been recorded by its special name. There seems to be no satisfactory interpretation other than the explanation that <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> in this inscription means spade money. A present consisting of spades and cowrie shells, which were also money at the beginning of the
<pb n="112"/>
Chou period, makes sense. Furthermore, <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> as a monetary designation for spades is borne out not only by the literary records but also by the legend on the Fün spades. The two known specimens of these are illustrated in <name type="pname">Okutaira</name>, IV, 52 b, and in Fang Jo's <hi rend="italic">Yüeh-yü ku-huo tsa-yung</hi> (reproduced on <ref target="#fig-53">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV, 2</ref>). Their legend reads <hi rend="italic">Fün pu or "Pu</hi> of Fün." <hi rend="italic">Pu</hi> here can refer to nothing else than the spade.</p>
               <p>The date for this inscription or the vessel on which it is inscribed has been suggested by Wu Ch'i-ch'ang as the nineteenth year of King Chao,<ref target="#CH4-n56">56</ref> the fifth king of Chou if we should regard King Wün as the titular founder of the dynasty. As Kuo Mo-jo has pointed out, the facts implied in the inscription, especially the name <name type="pname">Chiang</name> of the queen, do not permit such a date. Therefore he suggests the "nineteenth year" recorded in the inscription is that of the Chou as a dynasty (see below).</p>
               <p>As students of ancient Chinese history all know, the chronology of early Chou, that is before 841 B. C., is very uncertain, and in fact has been a controversial topic ever since the Han time. The problem is too complicated even to touch upon here. Prof. Tung Tso-pin lists fifteen different authorities on the subject, who hold eight different opinions.<ref target="#CH4-n57">57</ref> He himself is of the opinion that the Chou period officially begins with the following year after King Wu succeeded his father King Wün as the ruler of Chou in 1122 B. C. and actually begins with the year after King Wu conquered the <name type="pname">Shang</name>
                  <name type="pname">dynasty</name>, which took place in 1111 B. C.<ref target="#CH4-n58">58</ref> In the main he follows the traditional date. Dr. <name type="pname">R. S. Britton</name> told the author that as far as the records of the moon eclipses on the oracle bone inscriptions of the Wu-ting period go, Tung's date is untenable. He regards as more probable that the beginning of Chou was around 1027 B. C., which date has been suggested by <name type="pname">Lei Hai-tsung</name> and <name type="pname">B. Karlgren</name> who base their opinion on the chronological record in the original
<pb n="113"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bamboo Annals (Chu-shu chi-nieri)</hi> and other relevant historical data.<ref target="#CH4-n59">59</ref> For our present purpose we may follow the traditional date of 1122 B. C. as the beginning of the Chou period with the understanding that the correct date may be a century later.</p>
               <p>In his study of the bronze inscription quoted above Kuo Mo-jo follows Wang Kuo-wei's chronology.<ref target="#CH4-n60">60</ref> Wang Kuo-wei has proved that the recording of the chronology of the early years of Chou is not according to the reigns of the kings as is the case later. The recording of the year goes on with one serial number starting with King Wün's reign until the seventh year of the reign of King Ch'üng, the third king of Chou. In his opinion King Wün ruled seven years and was succeeded by King Wu who conquered <name type="pname">Shang</name> in the eleventh year of Chou or the fourth year of his own reign. King Wu was succeeded by <name type="pname">King Ch'üng</name>, whose reign officially begins in the fourteenth year. So calculated, the "nineteenth year" mentioned in the inscription falls in the sixth year of King Ch'üng's reign, which corresponds to the conventional date 1110 B. C.</p>
               <p>The presentation of a gift of cowries and spades by the ruler of the I people to <name type="pname">Yüan</name>, the royal scribe, appears to have taken place either in Han or in its neighborhood. Kuo Mo-jo identifies Han with the original territory of Han Cho or Cho of Han, and located it within the boundaries of the present county of Wei in eastern Shantung.<ref target="#CH4-n61">61</ref> Both his identification and the location of the place
<pb n="114"/>
are plausible, when we take into consideration the fact that by "I" the Chou people referred to all people in the eastern part of ancient <name type="place">China</name> who were either <name type="pname">Shang</name> or their subjects. After the third year of King Ch'üng, the Chou court started a large scale military campaign against such eastern states as Yen and Po-ku, which were either of <name type="pname">Shang</name> people or their vassals. These states were located in present Shantung. The campaign, which lasted three years, resulted in the subjugation of those states. It is possible that at the end of the victorious campaign King Ch'üng was brought to the newly conquered territories to establish the Chou authority. This may serve to explain the statement "the king was in Han."</p>
               <p>If all these interpretations are correct, the inscription has considerable importance in the dating of the spade coinage. For, if during the reign of the third king of Chou, which by the conventional chronology is in the last years of the 12 th century, or, at latest, in the last years of the 11th century, spade money had been offered as a gift, the beginning of the coinage must have been somewhat earlier. This would lend credit to the hypothesis that spade coinage was a <name type="pname">Shang</name> invention.</p>
               <p>In this connection we may introduce some records to the effect that the last <name type="pname">Shang</name> king had stored spade money at the Lu-t'ai, his treasury. The <hi rend="italic">Chou shu (Book of Chou)</hi> states that when King Wu conquered <name type="pname">Shang</name> he took out and distributed among the peopel "the ch'ien (spade coins) of the Lu-t'ai" and "the grain of the Chü-ch'iao (a granary)" of the <name type="pname">Shang</name> king.<ref target="#CH4-n62">62</ref> Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien relates that Ti-Hsin, the last king of <name type="pname">Shang</name> "overtaxed [his people] to increase [the storage of] the ch'ien at the Lu-t'ai."<ref target="#CH4-n63">63</ref> The distribution of ch'ien from the royal treasury of the <name type="pname">Shang</name> by King Wu of Chou is also
<pb n="115"/>
recorded in several other old literary sources.<ref target="#CH4-n64">64</ref> As has been explained before, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> is but another type of spade money or another name for it. Historians have been duly cautious in not giving full credit to these statements, but, in view of the record of spade coins in the early Chou bronze inscription, they may well contain historical truth.</p>
               <p>At this juncture we may recall that in the section dealing with the early history of trade in ancient <name type="place">China</name>, we have noted that the <name type="pname">Shang</name> period may have witnessed considerable commercial activities. Under these circumstances, the coinage of a metallic money is not at all beyond possibility. However, we must repeat that our suggestion of the possible early Chou or late <name type="pname">Shang</name> origin of the spade coinage depends largely upon our interpretation of the character <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> in the inscriptions on Yüan's vessels. We must safeguard ourselves against any definite conclusion based on a single piece of evidence, which may some day prove unacceptable.</p>

                  <p>Related to the problems of early monetary terms is another controversial subject which deserves a few lines of mention, that is, which term is earlier, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_110a.jpg"/>or <hi rend="italic">ch'üan</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_110b.jpg"/>.The latter term means a fountain or a spring. As early as 9 A. D. the emperor of the Hsin dynasty, <name type="pname">Wang Mang</name>, had borrowed it and used it in the sense of money, and had had it cast in the legends on both his "Small Coin" and the "Big Coin," but the term had lost its literal usage with the end of his reign. Elder Chinese numismatists who seem to relish anything uncustomary (the term ch'ien has been used as the general term for money ever since the Chou time) prefer ch'üan to ch'ien as the name for old coins. Therefore, for the titles of coin catalogues we have <hi rend="italic">Ch'üan chih</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'üan hui</hi> etc. But the novelty devised by <name type="pname">Wang Mang</name> has produced a belief in the mind of many that as a monetary term <hi rend="italic">ch'üan</hi> might be older than <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi>. Many Chinese numismatists, led by Li Tso-hsien, cherish this idea. A few others do not, and hence the endless debate, which lasts until today. Readers interested in this dispute can find information on it in the various works on Chinese coins, especially in the <hi rend="italic">Ch'üan-pi (Chinese Numismatics</hi>, Nos. 4, 21, and 22). It is unnecessary to repeat the argument here. In our opinion the term <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> is earlier than <hi rend="italic">ch'uan.</hi> The latter was first used by <name type="pname">Wang Mang</name>. ch'ien was the name of an old farming tool from which the spade coin developed. It is only natural that the spades, at least one group of them or those in one particular region, were so called. It is true that the character <hi rend="italic">ch'üan</hi> meaning money appears in the text of the <hi rend="italic">Chou li</hi>, and this has been taken as a proof for its early origin. But, as Ting Fu-pao has pointed out, the character <hi rend="italic">ch'üan</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Chou li</hi>, is a later revision made during <name type="pname">Wang Mang's</name> time <hi rend="italic">(Chinese Numismatics</hi>, No. 4, p. 27), as in an older edition of the work which was seen by <name type="pname">Chüng Chung</name> (first century A. D.), the earliest known commentator of the <hi rend="italic">Chou li</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> is found in lieu of <hi rend="italic">ch'üan</hi>. The reason <name type="pname">Wang Mang</name> adopted <hi rend="italic">ch'üuan</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> was his dislike for the character <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> (metal) which is the component part of ch'ien and <hi rend="italic">liu</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_110c.jpg"/>, the name of the ruling house which he usurped. Technically, <hi rend="italic">ch'üan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> sound similar in their pronunciation (Liang Ch'i-ch'ao <graphic url="NNM122_110d.jpg"/> (1873—1929) called attention to this many years ago in his article "Chung-kuo ku-tai pi-ts'ai k'ao," <hi rend="italic">Yin-ping-shih wün-chi</hi> 1916, XX, 70), and this made it possible to substitute easily the former for the latter.</p>

The possibility that spade coins were used at a very early date in the general area around modem Wei county is evidenced by the existence of a Prototype Spade coin and several Hollow-handle Spades cast by the city or mint of I <graphic url="NNM122_122c.jpg"/> (<ref target="#fig-35">

This I is identical with the I <graphic url="NNM122_122d.jpg"/> city which cast the round coins of four denominations at the end of the Chou period. The lower component part of the latter I is a later addition, the presence of which does not bring about any change in the meaning of the character. The I which cast the round coins has been located in present I-tu county whose county seat is about thirty miles west of that of Wei county in eastern Shantung. Some time after Chou conquered or subjugated this general area, it abandoned the spade coinage and adopted the knife coinage the origin of which took place probably in a state further to the east (see p. 156).</p>

               <head>3. THE VARIOUS TYPES OF SPADES AND THEIR CHRONOLOGY</head>
               <p>Attempts have been made in the past by a few to trace the evolution of the various types of spade coins.<ref target="#CH4-n65">65</ref> Their observations, however, have been too superficial to be of much value. Since scientific reports on discoveries of spade coins are lacking, a reconstruction of the evolution of their designs remains largely conjectural. We proceed with the conviction that the later the design of the coin, the less its resemblance to the original tool; and that the later the coin, the smaller its size and the lighter its weight. The gradual reduction in size and weight of coinage is a phenomenon common to the historical coinages of many peoples, and Chinese coinages could hardly have deviated from this law.</p>
               <pb n="116"/>
               <p>A number of spade coins bear no legend, but many more do. Judging from their design and weight, we may say in general that those without legends are older, and that those with legends are later. Among the spades with legends, those having a numeral or a character from the "heavenly stems" (numbering ten in all) or the "earthly branches" (numbering twelve in all) as their mark, or "serial mark," are earlier than those which have the name of a mint and, as frequently, the name of the monetary unit and its denomination.</p>
               <p>Epigraphical style can be resorted to as a means to determine the approximate time of the coin, but this is feasible only in the few cases in which the stylistic distinctions can be established.</p>
               <p>It would be very helpful if we knew the dates of establishment of the towns which cast spades for which specimens are known. Of the many mints which appear in the legends only those of <name type="pname">Tung Chou</name> (Eastern Chou) and one of <name type="place">An-yang</name> can be dated. The determination of the dates of their establishment contributes much to the dating of the coins of these two cities, and the dates of their coins corroborate our hypothetical premises for the reconstruction of the evolutionary stages of the spade coinage.</p>
               <p>There are some mint towns, for which the date of their establishment or of their coinage is unknown, whose geographical location reveals the approximate time when they cast the spades which bear their names. Hsiang-p'ing in southern <name type="place">Manchuria</name> and Lin on the Yellow River in <name type="place">Shansi</name> are towns of this kind. A study of their coinage, which will be dealt with when the Late Spade is treated, also helps confirm our chronology.</p>
               <p>The traditional classification of the spades which has been followed until recently by all numismatists has been based on their shapes with such terms as "hollow-handle spade" or "spade money," "pointed-foot spade," "square-foot spade," and "round-foot spade." <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name> and <name type="pname">Okutaira</name> appear to have found this classification inadequate. Therefore, in their works they have included the shape of the coin's shoulders as an additional criterion for classification. Thus they formulated such terms as "pointed-(or raised) shoulder-pointed-foot spade" and so on. Basically, however, they still follow
<pb n="117"/>
the old method. Some Western numismatists have given certain spades a specific name such as "weight money." In this case again, the primary consideration is the coin's shape.</p>
               <p>To numismatists who are historically minded, the traditional classification is inadequate and should be revised. In the present study we propose a classification according to the coin's chronology. Thus we may divide the spades into four major groups: the Prototype Spade, the Hollow-handle Spade, the Old Spade, and the Late Spade.</p>
               <p>Within each group we may further divide the coins according to their design. This aims not only at differentiating fine distinctions within a major group and their possible chronological sequence but also at investigating the regional character of a particular type. For instance, in the group of the Hollow-handle Spades there are two types differing radically in design. Although these two types appear to have been in circulation at the same time, their different designs suggest that they circulated in different areas. This is confirmed by the location of their mints as will be pointed out later.</p>
               <p>However, some words of caution must be added. First, the coin specimens preserved and reported today may not represent every shape or every variety of coin that has existed, though we believe that they represent the majority. It is on the basis of preserved varieties that this study is made. Secondly, though money itself has an inherent tendency toward uniformity in design, local varieties and local discrepancies in the time of adoption of a new design must be regarded as inevitable. This is especially true in a period, such as that of Chou <name type="place">China</name>, when customs in general and political and economic institutions in particular vary from area to area. The following presentation will be better evaluated and understood with these considerations in mind.</p>

                  <p>Specimens of this group of spades are illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> IV—V. Their characteristic feature is a faithful resemblance to the original farming tool. Some of the coins are very large; some are a little

smaller. Some possess all the practical features of the tool; some preserve them less. The criterion for their classification as one group is that their socket is like the tool's socket and extends onto the blade with the reinforcing ridge at the lower end of the socket remaining unchanged.</p>
                  <p>Most of the coins of this group bear no legend, though a few do. Judging from their size and design, the ones with a legend appear to be little later than the ones without. The paleographic style of the legend is the same as that of the early Chou bronze inscriptions.</p>
                  <p>The specimen in the collection of the American Numismatic Society is the smallest of all the specimens of the group known to us. It weighs 105.10 grams.</p>

                  <head>B. <hi rend="italic">Hollow-handle Spade</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Belonging to this group are two distinctively different types. One type (<ref target="#fig-28">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VI</ref> and <ref target="#fig-29">VII, 1</ref>) has pointed shoulders and pointed feet. Hereafter it will be designated as H. H. Spade I. The other type (<ref target="#fig-30">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VII, 2</ref>; VIII—X) has flat shoulders and mildly curved feet. Hereafter it will be designated as H. H. Spade II. The differences in their design are so marked and their affiliation to the original tool is equally so close that it does not seem to be possible that one type is a variation or a later development of another. As has been mentioned before, they seem to be two varieties of spade coinage developed from two differently shaped spade tools. The existence of these differently shaped tools is evidenced by the actual specimens excavated in <name type="place">China</name> and by the fact that there were two different names, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pu</hi>, for spade money in the Chou literature. (See pp. 90—93).</p>
                  <p>As implied in the term which we have chosen to designate this group of spades, their characteristic feature is the hollow handle which is found on each of them. The difference between the hollow handle of this group and the socket of the Prototype Spade, and for that matter also of the original tool, lies in the fact that the handle stops at the coin's shoulders and does not extend onto the blade. Their further deviation from the shape of the tool marks their lateness in origin and serves as a convenient criterion for their classification.</p>
                  <pb n="119"/>
                  <p>This group has the design of three parallel vertical lines on both obverse and reverse. The central line, which is shorter than the side lines, resembles the reinforcing ridge in the center of the tool, and the two side lines are the vestiges of the sides of the socket on the blade.</p>
                  <p>Most of the coins of this group bear an inscription, though quite a few do not. This is another evidence that they are later than the Prototype Spade but earlier than the spades which always have a legend. The legend may be a numeral, a character from the ten "heavenly stems" or the twelve "earthly branches," or the name of a town or city, which is likely to be the mint. As far as we know, among the hollow-handle spades which have been reported, those of Mi (<ref target="#fig-36">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 2</ref>) are the first ones in which the legend has the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> in addition to the mint name. On the whole the paleographic style of the legend of the Hollow-handle Spade appears to be the same as that of the Prototype Spade, namely, the "great seal character" style.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted, however, that among the Hollow-handle Spades there are still a third and a fourth type, both of which seem to be later in origin than the two types described above. In design, the third type (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XI—XII, hereafter to be designated as H. H. Spade III) differs radically from H. H. Spade I and slightly from H. H. Spade II. Their principal distinctive feature is the fact that the three lines on their obverse and reverse are not parallel, but starting from the point where the handle joins the blade, the outer two lines diverge towards the tips of the feet. The Hollow-handle Spades of <name type="pname">Tung-Chou</name> (Eastern Chou), Lu-shih, Wu, Wu-an are commonly seen representatives of this type.</p>
                  <p>However, the designs of this third type are not homogeneous in all details. While the shoulders of the Eastern Chou spades are flat, those of the other three mints are slanting. While the outer of the three lines on these spades start from the center at the top of the blade and diverge to the tips of the feet, the three lines on the spades of other mints, such as "An -hsiang," run parallel and are symetrically placed. But their common features in design, size, and weight are such that a treatment of them as one type is warranted. All
<pb n="120"/>
indications are that this type, i. e., H. H. Spade III, is probably a later development of H. H. Spade II. The insufficiency in the number of preserved specimens prevent us from any definite conclusions on this point.</p>
                  <p>The fourth group (<ref target="#fig-42">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 1—2</ref>, hereafter designated as H. H. Spade IV) are very few in number. The <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Old Coins</hi> contains illustrations of two specimens (Nos. 608 and 813), which are the only ones known to us. The authenticity of No. 813 seems reliable; it was in the possession of <name type="pname">Fang Jo</name>, an astute collector, who made and published a rubbing of the coin. Both specimens are small in size. Their blades are somewhat square in shape, plain on both sides, with no design whatsoever. Both the shoulders and the feet are flat. The date of their origin does not seem to be earlier than H. H. Spade III.</p>

                  <p>The period in which the Hollow-handle Spades circulated appears to have been considerable. Together with the Prototype Spades they covered the greater part of the time span of the entire spade coinage. An evidence of this is found in the Hollow-handle Spades bearing the name "Eastern Chou."</p>
                  <p>Eastern Chou was a feudatory which was established in the last year of King K'ao (426 B. C.) or in the first year of King Wei-lieh (425 B. C.).<ref target="#CH4-n66">66</ref> Thus the coins bearing the name of the feudatory must have been cast about 425 B. C. or shortly thereafter. At this time all feudal princes and the minor nobility had availed themselves of the privilege of coinage (see below, p.224). There is additional evidence for a late date for the Eastern Chou spades. First, their legend does not consist merely of a numeral or "serial mark" but includes also the name of the mint. Secondly, the three lines in their design are not parallel as on H. H. Spade II (which resembles the features of the original tool) but diverge toward the tips of the feet. This deviation indicates a late appearance. Thirdly, the Eastern Chou spade is one of the smallest of the Hollow-handle Spades. The measurements of the rubbing of Fang Jo's specimen<ref target="#CH4-n67">67</ref> are: total length, 70 mm.; shoulder width, 35 mm.; foot width, 37 mm.; blade length, 40 mm.</p>
                  <p>The largest specimen of the H. H. Spade II in the collection of the American Numismatic Society measures correspondingly 102, 53, 53, and 61 mm. This specimen is the older one not only because
<pb n="122"/>
of its larger size but also because its legend consists solely of a numeral <hi rend="italic">pa</hi> (eight). The Eastern Chou is considerably smaller in size and thus must be later, for the smaller a coin is, the later it is in date.<ref target="#CH4-n68">68</ref>

                  </head>
                  <p>The outstanding characteristics of this group of spades are the absence of the hollow-handle (socket), which are present in the two previous groups, and the split of the foot into two square feet. The representative specimens of this group are the spades of <name type="pname">An-i</name> (<ref target="#fig-5">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XIV, 4—5</ref>; <ref target="#fig-52">XV, 1</ref>), <name type="pname">Liang</name> (<ref target="#fig-47">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV, 1—3</ref>), <name type="pname">Chin-yang</name> (<ref target="#fig-44">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 3—5</ref>), etc. They are called "weight money" by Western numismatists. They still have a handle, but it is no longer hollow; it is flat and solid. Changes have taken place in the shape of the shoulders: some of them are round, and some are angular. Except for the "regular" spades of Liang, the spades of this group all have two feet which are uniformly square. Some of the spades have a central vertical line on the obverse and some do not. In the latter case the space is completely occupied by the legend. The reverse of some of them is plain, and some have a character, which represents an abbreviation of the mint name in the obverse legend or indicates the nature of the money, such as <hi rend="italic">ch'ung</hi> (token).</p>
                  <p>The appearance of the Old Spade was accompanied by an increase in number of denominations. The monetary unit of the spade is the <hi rend="italic">chin.</hi> The old spades of An-i and Chin-yang are each made up of three different denominational sizes: two <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>, one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> and half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>. For the spades of other mints which are preserved today, we
<pb n="123"/>
have only the two <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denomination (such as that of Ch'ui), or of the one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> and the half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denominations (such as those of Yü), or of the one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> (such as that of Yüan), or of just the half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> (such as that of Lu-shih). Since, in both shape and design, the coinages of these mints belong to the same group as those of An-i and Chin-yang their complete denominational system must also have been the same. Otherwise the specification of "two <hi rend="italic">chin,"</hi> or "one <hi rend="italic">chin"</hi> or "half <hi rend="italic">chin"</hi> alone would be meaningless. The lack of all three denominations for these mints must be due to incompleteness in their preservation.</p>
                  <p>Mention must be made of the coinage of the Old Spade period in Liang. Besides its regular Old Spades of the type of An-i and <name type="pname">Chin-yang</name>, the mint cast also two special series of spades. One is designated as <hi rend="italic">chüng</hi> or "standard," and the other is designated as <hi rend="italic">ch'ung</hi> or "token" (<ref target="#fig-54">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV, 3—5</ref>; <ref target="#fig-57">XVI, 1</ref>). The shape and design of the "token" spades of Liang are exactly the same as those of its regular Old Spade and the Old Spades of other mints. Its "standard" spades vary slightly in shape, but their basic features are similar to the common features of the Old Spade. Both series seem to have been issued for interstate commerce. (See further discussion, pp. 137—143.)</p>
                  <p>As has been indicated, the legend of the Old Spade is made up of three items: the name of the mint, the monetary unit, and its denomination whenever the specification of the denomination is necessary. Only the old spade of Fün (<ref target="#fig-53">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV, 2</ref>) varies from the rule. Its legend is <hi rend="italic">fün pu,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">fün</hi> being the mint name and <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> the designation of the money. This is the first and the only case in which the monetary designation <hi rend="italic">pu</hi> is found on a spade coin.</p>
                  <p>There is no positive evidence with which the date of the Old Spade can be determined. That it is later than the Hollow-handle Spade is unmistakable. Except for its general form, we do not find any of the significant features which mark the Hollow-handle Spade and which are reminiscent of the characteristics of the tool. As will be discussed below, the "Regular" and the "Token" spades of Liang (also known as Wei) appear to have been issued when
<pb n="124"/>
Liang, at the peak of its power, dominated Chou <name type="place">China</name>. This period is roughly between 425 B. C. and 344 B. C. and may well be the time when the Old Spade was in circulation.</p>
                  <p>Judging from its shape and design the Old Spade seems to have developed out of H. H. Spade II and III. The shape of their shoulders and feet which is, as a rule, flat and angular or square are similar. H. H. Spade I with its sharply pointed shoulders and pointed feet does not appear to be its predecessor.</p>
                  <p>At this point one may question what happened to the coinage of H. H. Spade I while H. H. Spade II and III developed into the Old Spade. It would seem that the shape of H. H. Spade I continued to be the shape of the coinage in the region where it had been current while H. H. Spade II and III were under further evolution in design. Its size, however, must have been reduced and its weight diminished to meet changing circumstances. Insufficient information prevents us from forming a definite conclusion.</p>

If genuine, it would provide additional and important information on the monetary system of the day.</p>

                  <p>The great majority of the spade coins preserved today belong to this group. They occupy the bulk of any collection, private or public, of Chou coins. According to shape and design they may be divided into four types:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Late Spade I—Pointed shoulders and pointed feet (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XVIII-XX; <ref target="#fig-71">XXI, 1–6</ref>).</l>
                     <l>Late Spade II—Square shoulders and square feet (<ref target="#fig-71">
                           <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXI, 7</ref>; XXII-XXIV).</l>
                     <l>Late Spade III— Round shoulders and round feet (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXV; <ref target="#fig-98">XXVI, 1–2</ref>).</l>
                     <l>Late Spade IV—Round shoulders and round feet with three holes (<ref target="#fig-100">
                           <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXVI, 3</ref>; XXVII).</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>A glance at the coins will convince us that Late Spade I developed out of H. H. Spade I, which have pointed shoulders and pointed

feet. Late Spade II descended from the line of the Old Spade of which the predecessor is H. H. Spade II. The origin of the shape of Late Spade III is more difficult to decide. It appears very much to have developed out of the shape of the "Regular" spade of Liang, (<ref target="#fig-54">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV, 3</ref>), both of which belong to the Old Spade (earlier than Late Spade III) and have a round handle, round shoulders and round feet. It might have been an imitation of Late Spade IV which was the design of the official currency of the state of Ch'in and will be discussed presently.</p>
                  <p>For each of the types there are two sizes. The large-sized specimens in the collection of the American Numismatic Society weigh approximately twice the smaller ones. Some small-sized specimens of Late Spade I and II have specification of their denomination in their legend, which appears either on the obverse together with the mint name or on their reverse (for examples see <ref target="#fig-63">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XVIII, 2</ref>; <ref target="#fig-80">XXII, 1</ref>). This is always the character <hi rend="italic">pan</hi> for "half." The denomination of the larger size, which weighs twice as much as the small, must then be "one," referring to the monetary unit of the spade, the <hi rend="italic">chin.</hi> Both the large and small-sized coins of Late Spade IV bear their denominational designations on the reverse (for examples see <ref target="#fig-100">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXVI, 3</ref>; XXVII). The denomination al designation of the large spade is <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> (Chinese ounce), and of the small is "twelve <hi rend="italic">chu"</hi>
                     <hi rend="italic">(chu</hi> being a very small unit of weight). Since at this time one <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> was made up of twenty-four <hi rend="italic">chu,</hi> the smaller coin is a "half" of the larger. Although different in size, the large and the small coins of each type have the same design. The characteristics of the types are shown in the chart on the opposite page.</p>
                  <p>An interesting phenomenon of the Late Spades is their lack of complete uniformity in design. Let us take the coins of Ta-yin as an example (<ref target="#fig-62">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XVIII, 1</ref>; <ref target="#fig-66">XIX, 3</ref>). The spades of this mint are of the type of L. S. I, but a few have square shoulders instead of the predominating pointed shoulders. A few others have square shoulders and square feet. These exceptional shapes are obviously

influenced by the shape of L. S. II. Although the forms of their shoulders and feet have changed, other features, however, remain.</p>
                  <p>Adoption by a mint of an alien coin type was one cause of the lack of uniformity in design. This is illustrated in the coinage of Chin-yang (<ref target="#fig-71">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXI, 1,3</ref>). During the period of the Old Spade, Chin-yang cast the spade with square feet. There is every reason to expect that in the days of the Late Spade the mint would have cast Late Spade II, which developed from the Old Spade. Instead it cast the type of Late Spade I. Some other mints changed the shapes of their coinage once or twice within the same period. Thus we find Chung-tu cast both L. S. I and II. Towns such as Lin cast three types of the Late Spade.</p>
                  <p>The reasons for these changes in design may have been technical, economic, or political. During the Chan-kuo period in which the Late Spade circulated, the economic relations between different areas had become much closer. Active inter-regional trade leads naturally to constant exchange and assimilation of local customs and institutions. Coinage was likely to have been affected by this process of general cultural assimilation or borrowing. The replacemant of one type of coinage by another, or the borrowing by one mint of the type of coinage of another, may have been a result of the superior economic influence of the latter.</p>
                  <p>Changes in coin type for political reasons may be detected in the coinage of <name type="place">An-yang</name>. The <name type="place">An-yang</name> spades in question belong to Type IV (<ref target="#fig-102">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXVII, 2</ref>). Spades of this type uniformly bear the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> on the large size and its half (twelve <hi rend="italic">chu)</hi> on the small. This type of the Late Spade differs in its monetary unit from the other three types, for which the unit is the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>. Since it has a special unit, it must have been a spade coinage of a special area, which was most likely the territory of the state of Ch'in. The round coin of Ch'in which was issued after Ch'in unified ancient <name type="place">China</name> and unified the monetary system is designated <hi rend="italic">liang</hi>. The identification of the same monetary unit on coinages of consecutive periods indicates that they circulated in the same area.</p>
                  <pb n="128"/>
                  <p>To be sure, students of Chinese history will find three towns by the name of <name type="place">An-yang</name>
                     <name type="pname"/>during the Chou period. One is mentioned by <name type="pname">Li Hsien</name> and others in their notes to a passage in the <hi rend="italic">Hou Han shu</hi> (Book of Later Han) and is located by them in present southeastern Shantung.<ref target="#CH4-n69">69</ref> A second, which was a town in the old Tai state in present northern <name type="place">Shansi</name>, is recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi>.<ref target="#CH4-n70">70</ref> A third is also recorded in <hi rend="italic">the Shih-chi,</hi> where it is stated that in 257/6 B. C., "After the Ch'in armies conquered Ning-hsin-chung, it was renamed <name type="place">An-yang</name>."<ref target="#CH4-n71">71</ref> This <name type="place">An-yang</name>was located southwest of the present city of like name in present northern <name type="place">Honan</name>.</p>
                  <p>The first <name type="place">An-yang</name> was located in the knife coinage area and cannot be the town which minted the spades. While both the second and the third are possibilities, we believe that the <name type="place">An-yang</name> which cast the spades with round shoulders, round feet and three holes is the third <name type="place">An-yang</name>, created by Ch'in in 257 B. C. We are led to this assumption by the fact that mints of this type of spade which have been deciphered and located were all situated close to the original territory of Ch'in. They are towns which were probably the first annexed by Ch'in in the course of its eastward expansion. It was probably after their conquest that Ch'in imposed on them its official coin type of round shoulders, round feet, with three holes.</p>
                  <p>Did Ch'in have an official type of spade coinage? The indications are that it did. In <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi,</hi> VI, 50a, it is stated that in the second year of King <name type="pname">Hui-wün</name> (336/5 B. C.) the Ch'in "For the first time <hi rend="italic">hsing</hi> money." In XV, 21a, in the chronological table for the Chan-kuo period it is stated under the same year, "The Son of Heaven (the Chou king) congratulated (Ch'in) for <hi rend="italic">hsing</hi> money." Literally, <hi rend="italic">hsing</hi> means "to put into usage or circulation." Scholars who argue for the late origin of metallic money in <name type="place">China</name> have stressed these records beyond their proper limits. Their amplification of the significance of these data to be indicative also of other regions of ancient <name type="place">China</name> is highly questionable, for we know that the spade
<pb n="129"/>
coinage had begun as early as the early Chou. At that time the territory of Ch'in was the center of the Chou royal domain. The discovery of the hollow-handle spades in the area<ref target="#CH4-n72">72</ref> is an indisputable proof. It may be possible that the Ch'in people, who came from the west with a comparatively backward economic tradition, had discouraged the use of metallic money, but how far this held true of the actual situation is a question. The "putting into circulation the money" in Ch'in in 336 B. C. appears to be more like the establishment of an official currency with the implication of a state monopoly in coinage. This might have been the policy which heralded the unification and state monopoly of coinage on a national scale in 221 B. C. after Ch'in conquered the whole country. Judging from all the indications, this official type of currency seems to be that with round shoulders, round feet, with three holes. The establishment of an official type of currency was possible in a state which was as centralized as Ch'in was in 336 B. C. If this assumption and the assumption that the spade money of Ch'in was the Late Spade IV is correct, we may say the commencement of this particular type of Late Spade III was in 336 B. C.</p>
                  <p>The date for the Late Spade can also be gauged from the coinage of Lin of Type III, which mint had also cast Types I and II. In and before the fifth century B. C. the area in which Lin of a later date was located was still occupied by the Ti people, not by the Chinese. According to King Wu-ling of Chao (325—299 B. C.) to which Lin belonged, Lin was conquered and annexed by one of his ancestors.<ref target="#CH4-n73">73</ref>This event must have taken place after the Chao state was officially created in 403 and before King Wu-ling became the ruler of the state in 325 B. C.<ref target="#CH4-n74">74</ref> That is to say that Lin as a mint of the Late Spade came into being only after 403 B. C. The commencement of its coinage may well be in the fourth century. In other words, the appearance of the Late Spade III of Lin cannot be earlier than 400 B. C.</p>

                  <p>As we know, between the termination of the spade coinage and the unification of the Chinese monetary system in 221 B. C. there was a period in which the round coin was the currency. In view of the fact that the round coins which are preserved or discovered are exceedingly few in comparison with the Late Spades, it seems that the period of the round coinage of Chou was very short. If we give twenty or thirty years for the period, we will have the year 250 B.C. as the approximate date for the end of the spade coinage. Thus, on the basis of all evidence available we get the following chronological order for the spade coinage:</p>

                  <p>This chronology reveals that the later the type of coin appeared, the shorter the period in which it was in circulation, and the faster it was replaced by newer types. The change of the types, or in other words, the adoption of new types, is accompanied by gradual reduction in size and weight and by the tendency to adopt more convenient forms of money.</p>

               <head>4. THE REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPADES</head>
               <p>Both the provenance of the spades and the locations of their mints demonstrate that the spades were a coinage of a special region in ancient <name type="place">China</name>.</p>
               <p>In 1942 <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name> published a prefatory article to a study of inscriptions on ancient Chinese coins, in which he says that he has collected 244 different characters appearing on spade coins alone.<ref target="#CH4-n75">75</ref>Judging from the average inscription on spade coins, at least eighty per cent of these, or about 195, must be names of mint towns. Many of the names of the mint towns, however, consist of two characters, and
<pb n="130"/>
these mint names account for two thirds of the total. Thus the actual number of mint names would be no more than 140. We have ourselves collected 147 names of mint towns on spade coins in the collection at the American Numismatic Society, supplemented in some cases by those in coin catalogues published before 1939. Because of the difficulties mentioned in the introduction, not all of these names have been satisfactorily deciphered or located. The following table contains the names and locations of eighty-seven mint towns. The name of the mint is given in the first column of the table. In the second column is noted the name of the state to which the mint belonged or in which it was located during the Ch'un-ch'iu period (770—481 B. C.). In the third column is found the name of the state or names of states to which the mint belonged during, or in greater part of, the Chan-kuo period (403—221 B. C.). In cases where the name of a mint is found to be that of more than one town with simultaneous existence in one state or in different states, and the identification with a particular town is thus impossible, all the possibilities will be found noted in the table. (Table see p. 131–135)</p>
               <p>The eighty-seven mint towns included in the above table should prove a sufficient number to show the geographical distribution of the towns which minted spade coins. In the Ch'un-ch'iu period, these mints were located in the royal domain of Chou and in the states of Yen, Chin, Chüng, Sung, Lu, Wei and other minor states. None was located in the states on the Shantung Peninsula (notably Ch'i, <name type="place">An-yang</name>, etc), or in the present Hupeh Province, the original territory of the state of Ch'u.</p>
               <p>The regional character of the distribution of the spade coins is further corroborated by their provenance. Hollow-handle Spades of various descriptions are reported to have been discovered in "Chung-chou" (<name type="place">Honan</name> Province) by <name type="pname">Li Tso-hsien</name>, <name type="pname">Pao K'ang</name>, <name type="pname">Ch'u Shang-ling</name>and <name type="pname">Ch'in Pao-tsan</name>, in "Pien-chung" (Kai-füng) by <name type="pname">Li Tso-hsien</name>, in "<name type="pname">Tsü-chou</name>" (Chin-ch'üng in <name type="place">S. E. Shansi</name>) by <name type="pname">Pao K'ang</name>, in "Lo" or "Lo-chung" (area around Lo-yang in <name type="place">N. Honan</name>) by <name type="pname">Fang Jo</name>, in Müng-chin (<name type="place">N. Honan</name>) by <name type="pname">Ch'u Shang-ling</name>, in "<name type="pname">Kuan-chung</name>"

H. Spade I in the Chou tombs by Kuo Pao-chün was made in Chi county, northern <name type="place">Honan</name>. In the Ch'un-ch'iu period, these areas were the territories of the royal domain of Chou and of the states of <name type="place">Chin</name>, <name type="place">Ch'in</name>, <name type="place">Yen</name>, <name type="place">Wei</name>, <name type="place">Chüng</name>and <name type="place">Sung</name>, in all of which mint towns of spade coins were located.<ref target="#CH4-n78">78</ref>
               </p>
               <p>If we examine further the locations of the mints of the various types of the spades, we will find that within this extensive area, certain types of spades are found to be local varieties of particular regions. H. H. Spade I and Late Spade I, which developed out of the former, appear to be a type of the region between the Yellow and the Fün Rivers in what is now southern <name type="place">Hopeh</name> and central <name type="place">Shansi</name>.
<pb n="137"/>
H. H. Spade II was the type along the Wei g, in <name type="place">central Shensi</name>, the Yellow River in <name type="place">Honan</name>and the Chi River in <name type="place">southwestern Shantung</name>. H. H. Spade III was the type in the region of present western <name type="place">Honan</name>, and Late Spade IV was the type of the state of Ch'in of the late Chan-kuo period, the territory of which corresponded to present western <name type="place">Shansi</name>, western <name type="place">Honan</name>and <name type="place">Shensi</name>.</p>
               <p>Some of the towns originally belonging to <name type="place">Sung</name>, <name type="place">Lu</name> and other states were annexed by Ch'u during the Chan-kuo period, and some originally belonging to Lu and Chin were annexed by Ch'i. Both Ch'i and Ch'u had their own special coinages, the knife and <hi rend="italic">Yüan Chin</hi> respectively. Coins show that change of political domination did not bring about abolition of the previous coinage and the exclusive adoption of that of their new overlords by these towns. It is true, of course, that a gradual change to wider circulation of the conquerors' currency took place.</p>
               <p>Although a specific type of coin, as the spade or knife, was regional in the location of its mints and principal circulation, it must be understood that inevitable trade between the various areas would cause limited amounts of currency to be used in outside areas.</p>

                  <p>A nineteenth century collector named Chin Hsi-ch'ang reports that during the reign of Emperor Ch'ien-lung (1736—1795)" several tens to a hundred" of hollow-handle spades bearing legends of "Wu" and "Lu-shih" were unearthed in mountains of Yü-hang in Chekiang Province <hi rend="italic">(Ch'ing-yün-kuan shou-ts'ang ku-ch'üan shu-chi</hi>, <name type="place">Coole</name>, 101, IX, 4b—5b). The locations of Wu and Lu-shih are indicated in the table. Yü-hang is in northern Chekiang near the sea coast. During the Ch'un-ch'iu period it was in the territory of Yüeh. It is not known how old the remains were in which the coins were discovered, therefore it is difficult to determine when those spades were brought there. They may have been brought at the time when they were still in Circulation in the interior of ancient <name type="place">China</name>.</p>

               <p>The term, "Special Old Spades." like other terms used to classify spade coins, is given purely for convenience's sake. With it we refer to a large group of spades of Liang which differ from its regular series of Old Spades. Both groups appear to have circulated at the same time. The legends on the special group are the longest found on any spade coins, whatever their type, and their content is also unusual. Inasmuch as the group differs from others substantially in monetary significance, they deserve special discussion.</p>
               <p>These spades may be divided into four types, The legends of two of the types are made up of six characters, while the legends of the
<pb n="138"/>
other two have seven and eight respectively. The six-character and the seven-character legends are not very difficult to read, but the eight-character legend has been, to use <name type="pname">Lacouperie's</name> words, "a stumbling block" to numismatists. To be sure, quite a few different readings for it have been suggested,<ref target="#CH4-n79">79</ref> but each of them is based on unacceptable conjecture. It is to Tung Yu-ch'üig (1791—1821) and Kuo Mo-jo (1892—) that we must give credit for its correct reading.<ref target="#CH4-n80">80</ref>The four legends are as follows:</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Liang,</hi> the first character in each of the legends, is the name of the mint or issuing city or authority, as are the first characters or initial combinations of characters in the legends of all coins of the Chou period.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Chüng,</hi> the second character in the legend of a) means "regular" and "standard." Some numismatists understand it as meaning "whole" or "a whole one," as against the "half" in the legend b).<ref target="#CH4-n82">82</ref> This, however, does not seem to be a plausible explanation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Pan,</hi> the second character in legend b) means "half," a denominational term used for all types of spades except the Hollow-handles. It must be used here in reference to the denomination of one of the other three types of the Special Old Spades of Liang. Since coins of legends c) and d) are of one group distinguished by the monetary designation "<hi rend="italic">ch'ung</hi>" in their legends and are different from type b), the type with which type b) with the "half" denomination is related must be type a), the full "unit" spade of Liang.</p>
               <p>The size of the spade of the "half" denomination is much smaller than that of the "unit" spade (see <ref target="#fig-54">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV, 3—4</ref>) with legend a) and legend b). According to Kuo Mo-jo, the weight of the spade with legend b) is approximately half of the spade with legend c).
<pb n="140"/>
As shown in the above chart, the spade with legend c) weighs approximately the same as the spade with legend a). Therefore, the weight of the spade of type b) must be about half the weight of the spade of type a). In other words, the spade of type a) represents the coin of a whole unit, while the spade of type b) represents that of a half unit.</p>
               <p>As specified in their legends, the monetary unit of the spades with legends c) and d) is the <hi rend="italic">chin.</hi> Since the spades with legends a) and b) belong to the same group, the monetary unit of the latter must be the <hi rend="italic">chin.</hi> The average weight of the spade with legend a) shown in the above chart is roughly the same as the weight of ordinary Old Spade of one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denomination, about 13 grams.</p>
               <p>The reading of the second character in legends c) and d) as <hi rend="italic">ch'ung</hi> has been accepted by most numismatists and some epigraphers.<ref target="#CH4-n83">83</ref> The primary meaning of the character <hi rend="italic">ch'ung</hi> is "to fill up," from which the meaning of "to be used as" or "to be reckoned as" is later derived. In the case of the spade with legend d), whose weight does not correspond to its denomination, <hi rend="italic">ch'ung</hi> actually signifies what we mean by the word "token." It is most likely that, though specified as of one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denomination, the <hi rend="italic">ch'ung</hi> spade with legend c) weighed less than the spade of the "standard" type of the same denomination.</p>
               <p>The last character in all of the legends is <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>, which has been erroneously identified and read as <hi rend="italic">yüan</hi> by most numismatists. This will be further explained on pp. 207—211.</p>
               <p>Anyone who reads the legends of the Special Old Spades of Liang cannot help being impressed and fascinated by the phrases "standard superior money," "money to be used as" and their equations to or exchange rate with the <hi rend="italic">lieh.</hi> These expressions or specifications are not found either in the legends of any other Old Spades or of the
<pb n="141"/>
spades of other types. Their unique nature leads us to believe that the Special Old Spades of Liang were cast to cope with new and special monetary situations.</p>
               <p>Let us examine the history of Liang to see whether we may find the special conditions which may have called forth the type. In the early years of the Chan-kuo period in which Old Spades appeared there were three places bearing the name "<name type="pname">Liang</name>." One, designated either as "<name type="pname">Liang</name>" or "<name type="pname">Shao Liang</name>" (Small Liang), was located on the west bank of the Yellow River in the central part of eastern <name type="place">Shensi</name>. Another, designated as "Nan Liang" (Southern Liang), was located south of the Ju River in central <name type="place">Honan</name>and appeared to have been annexed by the state of Han about 376 B. C. Both towns were situated in an area far from the economic and political center of <name type="place">China</name> of that day, and both were economically rather insignificant. Neither seems to have been the one which established the new and complex coinage under discussion.</p>
               <p>The third city with the name of <name type="pname">Liang</name>was <name type="pname">Ta Liang</name> or "<name type="pname">Great Liang</name>," capital of a state which was located on the eastern plain of ancient <name type="place">China</name> close to the "Cross-road," and on the Great Canal waterway system connecting the Yellow River valley and the valleys of the Huai and the Yangtze Rivers. It was strategically situated in the state of Liang, also known as Wei (to be distinguished from the Wei state whose name is written differently though pronounced the same, and which was created many centuries earlier). In 362 B.C. the state abandoned its old capital of An-i in the west, moved to <name type="pname">Great Liang</name>, which was made its new capital.<ref target="#CH4-n84">84</ref> Before 340 B. C., the year Liang yielded to the state of Ch'in all its land and towns west of the Yellow River at its southern bend, the territory of Liang was extensive and well placed, cutting across the central part of ancient <name type="place">China</name> and connecting Ch'in in the west (modern <name type="place">Shensi</name>) and Ch'i
<pb n="142"/>
in the east (Shantung Peninsula). In the north it had possession of the old Chung-shan state in central <name type="place">Hopeh</name>, and in the south it may have penetrated deep into the valley of the Huai River. In other words, the territory of the state occupied horizontally the central part of Chou <name type="place">China</name> in the Chan-kuo period. In this stratigically situated territory traversed the Yellow River, the Fün River, the Chang River, the Southern Chi River, and the canal system of the Great Canal. All of these were important waterways in ancient <name type="place">China</name> and constituted a communication system to and from all directions.</p>
               <p>Upon such a promising natural potentiality were exerted the efforts of a wise administration. The early history of the state is filled with laudatory stories about the administrative activities of the best statesmen of the age. During the reigns of Marquis Wün (425 —397 B. C.), Marquis Wu (396 —371 B. C.) and King Hui (370 — 319 B. C.) the state underwent fundamental reforms in both its politics and economy. It abandoned the traditional aristocratic rule by blood, and redistributed the land (at least in part of the state), aiming at bettering the life of the peasants. Ways and means were worked out to promote production in agriculture, and promotion of commerce had been encouraged. As a result, as Prof. Ch'ien Mu has rightly pointed out, the state acheived a sort of hegemony to be emulated by other feudatories over a period of some eighty years from 425 to 344 B. C.<ref target="#CH4-n85">85</ref> It was during this Old Spade period that the "Special Old Spades of Liang" were in circulation. Indications are that Liang cast these special spades in addition to its ordinary Old Spades, after the state moved its capital to Great <name type="pname">Liang</name> in 362 B. C.</p>
               <p>At this time commerce in <name type="place">China</name> was expanding. With their state the most powerful at the time, situated in a key economic area through which merchandise to and from all parts of <name type="place">China</name> must traverse, the rulers of Liang may have found it necessary and advantageous to issue special coins to facilitate the business transactions
<pb n="143"/>
between their merchants and those of other regions. This motivation is clearly manifested in the fact that every one of the Special Old Spades was given not only a denomination in terms of the local monetary unit <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>, but also a denominational equivalence in terms of the <hi rend="italic">lieh.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> seems to have been the weight unit of the early spade coinage and remained to be such in some parts of the spade area after Old Spades had made their appearance. The ever present specification of the equation between the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> on these Special Old Spades indicates that they were cast as a sort of interregional currency between the area where the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> was the monetary unit and the area which used the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>.</p>

            <head>V. THE KNIFE COINAGE</head>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e13174" type="section">
               <head>1. ITS ORIGIN AND DATE</head>
               <p>The problem of the origin of the knife coinage is much simpler than that of the spade. The character for <hi rend="italic">tao,</hi> the name of the knife coinage, is the same as for the instrument from which it developed. In shape, the coin faithfully resembles the original implement, and there is no possibility whatsoever for the coin to be taken as an imitation of any other object.</p>
               <p>In one of the first excavations in Yin-hsü, the last capital of the <name type="pname">Shang</name> dynasty, a bronze knife was recovered (<ref target="#fig-103">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXVIII, 1</ref>).<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> Its main features are identical with those of the early knife coin. Its body is slightly bent as is the Early Knife, and at the end of its handle there is a ring, which is also found on the coin. Its measurements, made from Li Chi's illustration, are 220 mm. in length and 25 mm. in width. Later two other bronze knives of the same shape were discovered at the same site.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref> One of them had a richly decorated handle on which the ring was replaced with a "horse's head." It is 288 mm. long and 38 mm. wide at its broadest point. The other knife was plain, 228 mm. in length and 36 in width, with the usual ring at the end of its handle. Different from the earlier one, the handles of these two are slit from end to end. The purpose for which the groove was made is not known.</p>
               <pb n="145"/>
               <p>The American Numismatic Society has in its collection a knife (<ref target="#fig-104">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXVIII, 2</ref>) which is said to have been discovered in Wei Hsien (Wei County) in eastern Shantung. It was badly oxidized through the ages, and in appearance gives the impression of being very old. Like the others described above, it has also a mildly bent body, but, unlike them, its blade is much narrower, being only 12 mm. at its broadest point, which is always the part of the blade which joins the handle. Its length is 220 mm. The ring at the lower end of the handle is exceedingly large. The handle which appears round in shape has a few parallel grooves, with four long ones running from end to end. Those grooves were obviously made to give the user a firm hold. This design on the tool reminds us of the two parallel lines on the handle of almost all of the knife coins, early or late. The two-line design on the handle of the coins certainly is in imitation of these grooves on the actual tool. Though this knife may not be the very type from which the first knife coins developed, it certainly suggests the features of the knife in general. The coincidence of the grooves on the tool and the raised two-line design on the coins becomes more significant when we consider that the reported location where the knife was discovered is in the area where the Early Knife coinage circulated.</p>
               <p>Some numismatists believe that the knife after which the coin was modelled was a household implement, and some contend that it was a weapon. Li Chi regards it as the <hi rend="italic">hsüeh</hi> mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">K'ao-kung chi<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref>
                  </hi> which is now incorporated in the text of the <hi rend="italic">Chou li.</hi> The ancient Chinese <hi rend="italic">hsüeh</hi> was something functionally like a whittling knife used to cut off thin slices from a piece of wood or bamboo. The shape of the knife specimens described above suggests such a functional use. In the <hi rend="italic">Chou li</hi> it is stated that the length of the <hi rend="italic">hsüeh</hi> is one <hi rend="italic">ch'ih</hi> (foot) and the width is one tenth. The longest of the foot measures of the Chou period which have been discovered and reported is 225 mm., and the shortest is 219 mm. The measurements
<pb n="146"/>
of the knives mentioned above correspond fairly well to those for the <hi rend="italic">hsüeh</hi> recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Chou li.</hi> This is additional support for Li Chi's identification with the <hi rend="italic">hsüeh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which type of the knife coins preserved today is the "early knife ?" This is still a topic of controversy. In our opinion the early knife coins are the large knives of Ch'i, Chi-mo, <name type="place">An-yang</name> and T'an (<ref target="#fig-105">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXIX</ref>—<ref target="#fig-114">XXXVIII, 1</ref>), which is also the opinion generally held by most numismatists, save for <name type="pname">Okutaira Masahiro</name> and <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name>.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name> contends that the earliest knife coins are the "sharp-pointed knives."<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> So also does <name type="pname">Okutaira</name>,<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> though he is silent on the reasons for his belief. <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name>expresses the following reasons for his contention: 1) Sharp-pointed Knives have a (thin) blade (in other words, they resemble more nearly the actual tool); 2) their legend is not a mint name; 3) the style of their inscriptions is mostly that of the "great seal character," while that of the large knives of Ch'i and the other three states is mostly in the style of the "small seal character."<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>To his first point we may counter that not only is the blade of the Sharp-pointed Knives thin, but every part of them is thin. In fact, their handle ring is so thin and flat that, contrary to Chüng's supposition, it only remotely resembles that of the original tool. The thinness and fragile appearance of the knives suggest rather that they are late in origin. Concerning the style of inscription, <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang's</name> argument is not borne out by facts. Comparison of the inscriptions on the Sharp-pointed Knives and on the large knives of Ch'i and the other three states does not show marked differences in style. There are also archaic pictograms in the inscriptions of the large knives. Furthermore, it is his opinion that the Sharp-pointed Knives lasted a long time and remained in circulation as late as the Chan-kuo period.<ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> In other words, they
<pb n="147"/>
are not only anterior to the Ch'i knives, but also contemporary with and posterior to the latter for certain periods. It is difficult to see how <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name> could reconcile the late date of these knives with their supposedly more archaic style of inscription. The fact is that the stylistic distinction alleged by him does not exist.</p>
               <p>Of the three reasons expressed by <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name> the second is the most plausible, but here too he failed to make his argument convincing. Of the many hundred Sharp-pointed Knives preserved today only one specimen, that of Lin, or possibly two (if that of Liao reported by him be included), bears a mint name. Yet <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name> has admitted that as late as the Chan-kuo period, or the end of the Chou dynasty, Sharp-pointed Knives continued in circulation. Many of the Sharp-pointed Knives in circulation then must be without inscription of the mint name. This fact demonstrates clearly that the inscription of mint name alone, or rather the absence of mint name as the coin's legend, cannot be sufficient evidence for determination of its date. Among the Small Knives of the third century B. C. the great majority have no legend whatsoever. Can we say that those uninscribed late knives were earlier than the inscribed Ch'i knives? What makes one most skeptical about <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang's</name>alleged early origin of the Sharp-pointed Knives is the unbelievably long duration in circulation which he ascribes to them. <name type="pname">Chüng Chia-hsiang</name>contends that they originated at the beginning of the Chou dynasty and lasted into the end of the period, covering about eight centuries. This would require that in such a long period no noticeable changes occurred to the coins with regard to their shape, length or weight, while in immediately adjacent areas the spade coin was undergoing constant change in those respects.</p>
               <p>We believe that the knife coinage like the spade coinage had undergone many and marked changes from its beginning to its end, and we also believe that the Sharp-pointed Knives were considerably late in origin. In addition to their small size and low weight, the evidence in support of our belief is: First, Sharp-pointed Knives are reported
<pb n="148"/>
to have been discovered together with Ming knives<ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref> which, as admitted by all, were coins of the Chan-kuo period and consequently late in origin; secondly, the town of Lin had cast this type of knife.<ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> Lin was not established before 430 B. C. (see above p. 128). Since the Lin sharp-pointed knife is typical in every respect, the Sharp-pointed type of knife coinage could not have begun much earlier than this date.</p>
               <p>The evidence for an earlier date for the large knives of Ch'i is to be found in their legend, which reads <hi rend="italic">Ch'i tsao-pang ch'ang fa-huo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_158a.jpg"/> or "Everlasting legal money of Ch'i at the establishment of the State" (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXIX).<ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref> Here the phrase <hi rend="italic">tsao-pang</hi> (establishment of the state) is the point of crucial importance.</p>
               <p>When was the state of Ch'i established ? The answer varies with different numismatists. Some of them, and many historians too, follow the traditional account of the history of Ch'i and believe that it was established as a feudatory state after Lü Wang, popularly known as T'ai-kung Wang, the most important assistant of King
<pb n="149"/>
Wün and King Wu of Chou, was enfeoffed with Ying-ch'iu in the territory of Ch'i after King Wu conquered the Shang dynasty in 1122 B. C. (conventional date).</p>
               <p>Other numismatists are skeptical about such an early date for the coins although they still believe in the traditional date of 1122 B. C. for the enfeudation of Lü Wang by King Wu. To reconcile the conflict between their belief of the late origin of the knife coins of Ch'i and that of the traditional origin of the state, they advance a different interpretation of the phrase <hi rend="italic">tsao-pang</hi>, establishment of the state. They argue that the phrase does not refer to the first creation of Ch'i in the twelfth century but to the hegemony the state attained during the reign of Duke Huan (685 —643 B. C.). They then naturally assume that the <hi rend="italic">tsao-pang</hi> knives were cast in the seventh century. Of this interpretation Chüng Chia-hsiang is the exponent.<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Some other numismatists find the explanation of this school untenable, for the reason that, though Duke Huan achieved hegemony over other feudal states and even the royal court, he did not "establish" a new state. However, they share the conviction that the Ch'i large knives were late in origin. Happily, they find an event in the history of the state of Ch'i which could be interpreted in their favor, the usurpation of Ch'i of the house of Chiang (family name of Lü Wang and his descendants) by the house of T'ien in 386 B. C.<ref target="#CH5-n12">12</ref> The T'ien were a powerful noble family in the state of Ch'i from the thirties of the fifth century on. In 391 B. C. T'ien Ho expelled Duke K'ang of Ch'i to an island off the Shantung Peninsula. In 386 B. C. he established himself as the ruler of the state. In the opinion of these numismatists, the usurpation of Ch'i of Chiang by the T'ien is the "establishment of the state" referred to by the legend of the <hi rend="italic">tsao-pang</hi> knives. The numismatist who strongly advocates this theory is Okutaira Masahiro.<ref target="#CH5-n13">13</ref>

               <p>Most numismatists follow the first of the three hypotheses, few the second, and still fewer follow the third. After examining all relevant facts, however, we find none of the three satisfactory.</p>
               <p>The third theory advocated by Okutaira does not fit into the chronology of ancient Chinese coinage. The large size, heavy weight, and the archaic epigraphical style of the coin legends preclude the possibility of the Ch'i large knives being coins of the fourth century. Though the power of the state of Ch'i had been transferred from one family to another, a new state was not created. In its institutions, legally, politically and economically, the old Ch'i continued in every respect. Even the very name of Ch'i was still kept by the usurper.</p>
               <p>The second interpretation as advocated by Chüng Chia-hsiang has similar weaknesses. Duke Huan inherited the Ch'i created by his forefathers. Though he expanded the territory of the state and made it powerful, he did not establish a new one. For Duke Huan to have regarded the Ch'i during his reign as his own new creation would have run counter to the old Chinese political and ethical philosophy that the state was sacred property handed down by their ancestors to a ruler as a household was to an ordinary man. According to this philosophy the very existence of posterity was a favor from the ancestors and the survival of the state depended on their protection. Posterity owned nothing and created nothing, though posterity could glorify the state by aggrandization.</p>
               <p>On the whole we agree with the first interpretation that the knife coins of Ch'i were cast when the state was first established, but we disagree with the traditional date of the state's establishment.</p>
               <p>King Wu did not grant the territory of Ch'i to Lü Wang as his fief. He could not, for during his reign the territory which later came to be known as Ch'i had not been conquered by Chou and was still in the hands of the Shang people or their vassals. This has been proved by Prof. Fu Ssŭ-nien.<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> Prof. <name type="pname">Fu</name> also contends that the very name of
<pb n="151"/>
the supposed recipient, Lü Wang or Wang of Lü, suggests that the original fief of Wang was Lü and not Ch'i. Even Wang's son still bore this name, Lü.<ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref> As we know, in ancient China after a noble was granted a fief or appointed to an office he was thereafter generally called by the name of the fief or that of his office. Therefore the Lü of Wang whose original family name was Chiang was undoubtedly the name of his fief or his main fief (see below). Lü as a feudatory in the early days of Chou was located west of present Nan-yang in Honan.</p>
               <p>However, it is an undeniable historical fact that Ch'i was a state of Lü Wang's descendents. In the Ku-ming chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Shang-shu,</hi> Lü Chi, Lü Wang's son or one of his sons, is already called by the title of "Ch'i Hou" or "Marquis of Ch'i" in 1079 B. C. There is no doubt that at this time the territory of Ch'i had been granted to Lü Chi. This is thirty-two years after that district was conquered by Chou, probably in 1111 B. C., according to the traditional date. The first recipient of the Ch'i fief might have been Lü Wang himself, for in the early historical literature he is depicted as a man who had lived for a considerable length of time. Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien records that he lived for "more than one hundred years."<ref target="#CH5-n16">16</ref> The old text of the <hi rend="italic">Bamboo Annals</hi> states that he died in the sixth year of King K'ang, which falls in 1073 B. C. in the traditional chronology.<ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref> If the latter record is reliable, it is possible that Lü Wang was the recipient of the fief.</p>
               <p>Does the possible grant of Ch'i to Lü Wang mean the establishment of Ch'i as a feudal state ? It may or may not. A passage in the T'an-kung chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Li chi</hi> states that "Since T'ai-kung (Wang) was enfeoffed with Ying-ch'iu (as his fief) down to the fifth generation his descendants always returned their dead to Chou for burial."<ref target="#CH5-n18">18</ref> This statement makes it clear that as late as the fifth generation
<pb n="152"/>
Ch'i was not regarded as their home by the very noble beneficiaries. Our impression is that after the area of Ch'i was conquered by Chou in 1111 B. C. it might have been given to Lü Wang as an additional fief if he had lived that long, or to his son Lü Chi as his fief, with his fathers original fief, Lü, retained in the hands of other members of the noble family. If the recipient was Lü Wang, there is no reason to believe that he had resided there. As indicated in a passage in the Ku-ming chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Shang-shu,</hi> even his son Lü Chi, who bore the official title of "Marquis of Ch'i," stayed at the Chou court and served as an important minister. If the recipient was Lü Chi, he was an absentee feudal lord. In neither case does Ch'i seem to have been established as a state, though the noble family might have received revenues from their fief.</p>
               <p>It was the tradition of the Chou that the establishment of a feudatory must be accompanied with the completion of the following steps: 1) investiture including the casting of memorial bronzes; 2) the construction of the <hi rend="italic">she</hi>, altar for the god of the earth and symbol of the existence of the state; 3) the erection of the ancestral temple of the ruling family; and 4) the construction of a walled capital. The completion of these requirements could be prolonged for some time. Since down to the fifth generation the nobles of Ch'i still sent their dead back to Chou for burial, there is more reason to doubt than to believe that Ch'i had been established as a feudal state before the fifth generation of the noble house.</p>
               <p>This conjecture fits into Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien's account of the early history of Ch'i in <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi>, XXXII. During the first five generations the history of the noble family of Ch'i was full of internal feuds. Duke Hsien was the first to establish his capital at Lin-tzŭ, which remained such until its conquest by Ch'in in 221 B. C. Taking Lü Wang as the first ancestor, Duke Hsien was the fifth generation in Ch'i pedigree. It is quite possible that Duke Hsien may have been the one who "established" the Ch'i state, and who, if our foregoing hypothesis be correct, cast the <hi rend="italic">tsao-pang</hi> knives of Ch'i. Duke Hsien ruled Ch'i during the reign of King I of Chou, which corresponds
<pb n="153"/>
to 894—879 B. C. according to the traditional date. This assumption, while reasonable, cannot, however, be substantiated otherwise. Therefore, we may tentatively conclude that the <hi rend="italic">tsao-pang</hi> knives of Ch'i may be as early as around 1079 B. C. and as late as the first half of the ninth century.</p>
               <p>Is the <hi rend="italic">tsao-pang</hi> knife, the earliest of all Ch'i knives, also the earliest of the knife coinage ? This is another question which deserves serious consideration. In addition to those of Ch'i, there are also the large knives of Chi-mo, An-yang and T'an (<ref target="#fig-1">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXXIV—XXXVIII, 1</ref>.) Chi-mo, An-yang and T'an were all old states on the Shantung Peninsula in ancient <name type="place">China</name>. Because they were later annexed by Ch'i, the general impression is that they had belonged to Ch'i from the beginning. In fact, though, Ch'i was a small state before 685 B. C. with its eastern border only about a dozen miles from its capital, Lin-tzŭ.<ref target="#CH5-n19">19</ref> Chi-mo was situated on the tip of the Shantung Peninsula with a number of minor states between it and Ch'i. It is not certain whether Chi-mo was conquered by Ch'i before 522 B. C.<ref target="#CH5-n20">20</ref> T'an remained an autonomous state until 684 B. C. when it was subjugated by Ch'i.<ref target="#CH5-n21">21</ref> As late as 412 B. C., An-yang was still a state that rivaled Ch'i.<ref target="#CH5-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>These three states, together with a number of others also on the Shantung Peninsula, were derogatorily designated by the Shang people as I Fang or "Barbarian States" and by the Chou people as Tung I or "Eastern Barbarians." The contrary seems to be true, for the people of these eastern states seem to have had a civilization
<pb n="154"/>
which could match that of the Shang and the Chou peoples, if indeed not superior to that of the latter for some time. They were powerful enemies of Shang and remained such of Chou during the first two hundred and fifty years of its history. The wars which Ti Hsin, last king of Shang, waged against them caused the fall of the dynasty. The three-year military campaign which the Duke of Chou conducted against them resulted in the subjugation of only the limited area of Ch'i and Lu (the original names of the territories being Po-ku and Yen, two of the eastern Shang states which are also regarded as "Eastern Barbarians" by the Chous). The states east of Ch'i and Lu remained powerful and hostile as ever.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, information concerning the institutions and customs of these peoples is lacking in all of the literary sources, and except for the site of Ch'üng-tzŭ-yai (east of Tsinan) no archaeological work has been done in their area. Fragmentary evidence indicates that these people had a different culture from the Chou and, for that matter, the Shang people. Confucius' statement about the barbarian customs of having hair hanging down loosely and buttoning the breast of the coat on the left side seems to refer to customs of these peoples.<ref target="#CH5-n23">23</ref> When he expressed his wishes to go and live among the Nine I or the "nine barbarian peoples," "some one" voiced disapproval.<ref target="#CH5-n24">24</ref> Since they had a different general cultural pattern, they might have had different economic institutions. Their special knife coinage was one of these.</p>
               <p>The Eastern Barbarian states of Chi-mo, An-yang and T'an were not conquered by Ch'i until after the beginning of the seventh century. They had, however, already cast large knives of the type of Ch'i for at least two centuries, and there are indications that the Ch'i knife might have been borrowed from one of them.</p>
               <p>Which state among these was the first to adopt knife coinage ? It is impossible to say; some state for which no specimens have been discovered or preserved may very well have been the first. There is an indication that the Chi-mo knife was earlier than the Ch'i knife in
<pb n="155"/>
the way in which the phrase of "establishment of the state" is written. On the Ch'i knife, the term is found in the obverse legend, and it reads <hi rend="italic">tsao pang</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_165a.jpg"/>. On the Chi-mo knife, the term is found to be the inscription on the reverse, and reads <hi rend="italic">k'ai füng</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_165b.jpg"/>. With <hi rend="italic">tsao</hi> (literally meaning "to make") and <hi rend="italic">k'ai</hi> (meaning "to open," "to create") each meaning the same in their use to convey the idea of establishment of a state,<ref target="#CH5-n25">25</ref> the only difference is that in one case the character <hi rend="italic">pang</hi> is used and in the other <hi rend="italic">füng</hi>. It has long been known that originally these two characters were completely synonymous, being two forms of the same character. The discoverer of the etymological history of the two characters is Wang Kuo-wei, who traces their origin to the practice of planting trees along the borders of a territory to mark boundaries. Of the two, <hi rend="italic">pang</hi> is undoubtedly later than <hi rend="italic">füng,</hi> for while <hi rend="italic">füng</hi> in its original form is a pictogram symbolizing two standing trees, <hi rend="italic">pang</hi> is signic-phonetic with its signic being the component part <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_165c.jpg"/> for "town" or "city." As a rule signic-phonetic characters are later than pictograms.<ref target="#CH5-n26">26</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The late origin of <hi rend="italic">pang</hi> can be determined not only by epigraphical
<pb n="156"/>
analysis but also by the inscriptions in which it appears. <hi rend="italic">Pang</hi> appears in the inscription of <hi rend="italic">an-pang</hi> on the reverse of some of the early Chi-mo knives. The inscription means "making the State secure" or "consolidation of the state." By implication, the phrase refers to an action which is later than what is implied in the phrase <hi rend="italic">k'ai-füng,</hi> which, as has been said above, means "creation or establishment of the state." On account of this the knives which bear the inscription of <hi rend="italic">k'ai-füng</hi> must be earlier than the knives which bear the inscription of <hi rend="italic">an-pang.</hi> Hence <hi rend="italic">füng</hi> is earlier than <hi rend="italic">pang.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the earliest knives of Ch'i have the character <hi rend="italic">pang</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">füng,</hi> they most likely were later than the earliest Chi-mo knives which have <hi rend="italic">füng</hi> in their inscriptions. This assumption seems to be confirmed by the fact that at the end of the eleventh or the tenth century B. C., that is, before Ch'i cast its knives, the coinage of the area around Ch'i seemed to be the spade. Among the Prototype and the Hollow-handle Spades there are some specimens of which the legend is "I" (<ref target="#fig-27">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 2</ref>) basically the same as it appears on the round coins of I. I as the mint town of the round coins has been correctly located in the present I-tu County, southeast of Lin-tzŭ, ancient capital of Ch'i. The mint town which cast the round coins may be the same one which cast the spades. We may say then that before Ch'i adopted the knife coinage, the area in which the state was located had used the spade as currency. It appears that after Ch'i was established, or some time later, it adopted the coinage of its eastern neighbor or neighbors. As far as the preserved knife coins show, the Chi-mo knife seems to be the one on which Ch'i modelled its own.</p>
               <p>With regard to the date of the "establishment" of the Chi-mo state and the commencement of its coinage, there is no information whatsoever. It is hoped that in the future Chinese scholars will fill in the missing pages in the history of the eastern states of ancient <name type="place">China</name> by extensive archaeological explorations. At the moment we have to be satisfied with the simple observation that knife coinage is certainly of eastern origin and that the state of Ch'i which has so widely been associated with it may not be its inventor.</p>

It is not known, however, whether the state had been conquered by Ch'i at this time.</p>

They meant the "boundary" marked by trees, then "boundaries of a state," and eventually "the state" itself. Since they had the same meaning, they must have been pronounced the same. As discovered by Ch'ien Ta-hsin, the ancient Chinese had no "light" labial sound, therefore <hi rend="italic">füng</hi> must have been pronounced something like <hi rend="italic">püng. Püng</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pang</hi> are but variations resulted from a slight change in pronounciation. In identifying <hi rend="italic">füng</hi> with <hi rend="italic">pang</hi> Wang Kuo-wei did not use the inscriptions on the Chi-mo and Ch'i knife coins. If he had, his work would have been much easier and more direct.</p>

               <head>2. THE EARLY KNIVES AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION</head>
               <p>By Early Knives we mean the large knives of Chi-mo, Ch'i, Anyang and Pan (<ref target="#fig-105">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXIX</ref>—<ref target="#fig-114">XXXVIII, 1</ref>), which in our opinion are the earliest of all of the knife coins preserved today. Except for the smaller Chi-mo knives which obviously were a later development and for which there are no counterparts from other mints, the physical appearance of the knives of all four states is practically the same. They all have a mildly bent body with the top end of the blade protruding and forming a tip. All have a handle decorated with two parallel lines reaching both ends of the handle. At the lower end of the handle is attached a ring, which is uniformly round. On the obverse, the blade is entirely occupied by the legend. Around both the blade and the handle are raised borders, with those around the blade especially high and thick; the raised border along the cutting edge of the blade is a little thinner than that on its back. In these, however, two groups of the Ch'i knives vary a little: Their raised borders are of the same width and the same height all over the knife's body and at the back the raised border is not cut at the juncture of the handle and the blade.</p>
               <p>On the reverse of the knife's blade there is always an inscription, of either one or two characters. These characters or combinations of characters are generally regarded as "serial marks." Above the inscription is the uniform design of three horizontal and parallel lines. This design has often been mistakenly read by the Western numismatists as the character <hi rend="italic">san</hi> for "three." Between this design and the inscription there is always the mark which appears sometimes in the form of a point and sometimes in the form of a cross. It is the latter form which some Western numismatists take to mean "ten."</p>
               <p>On the reverse the handle has the same design as on the obverse: two parallel lines reaching both of its ends. On the handle as well as the blade a slightly raised line forms the borders. They are lower and thinner than those on the obverse side of the blade and handle.</p>
               <p>According to their legends, the Early Knives of the mints or states above mentioned may be divided into smaller groups. In the case of the Ch'i knives there are four such groups. They are as follows:</p>

               <p>The legend of Group A can be shortened by dropping the character <hi rend="italic">fa</hi> for "legal." The American Numismatic Society has a rare specimen, the legend of which is in this shortened form (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXX),</p>
               <p>The knives of Groups B and C are very common, but Groups A and D are comparatively rare. Since the pieces of Group A are specified to be money cast at the "creation or establishment of the state," they must be the earliest of them all.</p>
               <p>The coins of all four groups are of approximately the same size. While we presume that difference in size may indicate difference in weight, the variation is so slight and the degree of oxidization to which the coins have been subjected is so uncertain that it is unwarranted to make a definite statement to that effect. In design the four groups of Ch'i knives are the same except for a distinctive characteristic which may serve to regroup them into two types. Discovery of it must be credited to Chüng Chia-hsiang.<ref target="#CH5-n27">27</ref> In Groups C and D the broad raised border at the edge extends only around the blade and does not continue around the handle as it does on the other two groups.</p>
               <p>The large knives of Chi-mo may be divided into two groups according to their legend and size. The first type is larger and bears the legend of <hi rend="italic">Chi-mo chih fa-huo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_168f.jpg"/> meaning "Legal money of Chi-mo" (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXXIV—XXXV) while the second is smaller and
<pb n="159"/>
bears the legend of <hi rend="italic">Chi-mo fa-huo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_169a.jpg"/> with the same meaning (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXXVI).<ref target="#CH5-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The first or the larger group of Chi-mo knives share the usual designs common to all the early knives. They bear on their reverse two interesting inscriptions: <hi rend="italic">k'ai-füng</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_169b.jpg"/> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXXIV) and <hi rend="italic">an-</hi> pang <graphic url="NNM122_169c.jpg"/> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXXV), meaning "creation (or establishment) of the state" and "consolidation of the state" respectively. They imply that the knives with the <hi rend="italic">k'ai-füng</hi> inscription must be issues at the creation of the state of Chi-mo and that the knives with the <hi rend="italic">an-pang</hi> inscription must be issues after the creation of the state, but, as far as their physical appearance (judged from the limited number preserved today) goes, there do not seem to be any marked differences between them.</p>
               <p>Marked differences, however, do exist between the first and second groups of Chi-mo knives. Since we have found that the larger knives of Chi-mo are either the first issues or issues shortly after, the smaller group must have been cast at a later date. A comparison of the two groups reveals that differences exist between them not only in size but also in weight. A specimen belonging to the first group chosen at random from the collection of the American Numismatic Society measures 181 mm. long and weighs 73.65 grams. The heaviest specimen of the second group in the same collection measures 150 mm. long and weighs 50.10 grams. In addition to weight, differences in the designs of the two groups, especially on the reverse, are also conspicuous. The reverse of the large knives (the first group) of Chi-mo has the common design of all the large knives already described, but the reverse of the small knives (the second group) is plain. The border line on the blade of the second group appears incomplete: sometimes it appears on the cutting edge and sometimes on the back of the blade. In weight, in size, as well as in design, the Chi-mo knife coinage had degenerated considerably in the stage of the second group.</p>
               <pb n="160"/>
               <p>So far as the specimens preserved are concerned, the An-yang large knives are much simpler. All of them bear the same legend on their obverse. It reads <hi rend="italic">An-yang chihfa-huo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_170.jpg"/> (Legal money of An-yang; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXXVII), though the inscriptions on their reverse vary as in the case of the knives of Ch'i and Chi-mo. Their size is approximately the same. The American Numismatic Society has eleven specimens in its collection. The average width at the top of the blade is 30 mm. and their length varies between 186 mm. and 163 mm. This observation is in agreement with specimens illustrated in coin catalogues. The <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'ien ta-tz'ŭ-tien</hi> has an illustration (no. 1034) of a smaller specimen, which has a width of 27 mm. and a lenght of 155 mm., considerably shorter and narrower than the average.</p>
               <p>However incomplete the preservation of the early knives of Ch'i, Chi-mo and An-yang, that of T'an is most deplorable. Of this mint or state there is only one specimen preserved. This specimen is not even a whole one: only the upper part of the blade is preserved (<ref target="#fig-114">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXXVIII, 1</ref>). This fragment of the large knife of T'an was in the possession of Fang Jo whose rubbing of the coin is found in his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Yüeh-yü ku-huo tsa-yang.</hi> In form the upper part of the T'an knife is in agreement with the knives of the other three states: Ch'i, Chi-mo and An-yang, but on the reverse of its blade there are only two horizontal lines instead of three as found on the reverse of the blade of the knives of other states. Only two characters are preserved of the legend on its obverse. The first one is <hi rend="italic">T'an,</hi> the name of an old state which was located east of modern Tsinan and conquered by Ch'i in 684 B. C. The second character is only partially preserved, but preserved enough to be recognized as the character <hi rend="italic">pang,</hi> meaning "state," as it is found in the legends of the <hi rend="italic">tsao-pang of</hi> the Ch'i knives and the <hi rend="italic">an-pang</hi> of the Chi-mo knives. The designation of T'an as a <hi rend="italic">pang</hi> or state is another unequivocal evidence that the large knife of T'an and those of other states of the same type were issues before 684 B. C. when T'an was still a state.</p>
               <pb n="161"/>
               <p>T'an, Ch'i, Chi-mo, and An-yang were all states of ancient <name type="place">China</name> located in the same general area. The capital of Ch'i, Lin-tzŭ was located approximately on the site of the modern city of the same name in northeastern <name type="place">Shantung</name>. Chi-mo was located in the area north of the Chiao-chou Bay on which the port of Tsingtao is situated. The exact location of An-yang is not certain, but that it was between Ch'i and another old state named Chü on the southeastern coast of the Shantung Peninsula seems almost beyond question. So, the early knives are all coins of states on the Shantung Peninsula.</p>
               <p>This regional character of the early knives is further corroborated by their provenance. Ch'i knives have been discovered in Ch'ang-yang (present Lai-yang), Ch'ing-chün (i. e., I-tu), Chang-ch'iu, Tüng-chou (present P'üng-lai), Lai-chou (present Yeh), Lai-yang and Chu-ch'üg.<ref target="#CH5-n29">29</ref> The Chi-mo knives were found in the northeastern and eastern sections of the present Chi-mo,<ref target="#CH5-n30">30</ref> and the An-yang knives around Tsinan, in Lai-yang and east of the county seat of modern Chi-mo.<ref target="#CH5-n31">31</ref> In the excavations of the site of Ch'üng-tzŭ-yai the handle of an Early Knife coin of the large type was discovered.<ref target="#CH5-n32">32</ref> Ch'üng-tzŭ-yai was the old capital of T'an.<ref target="#CH5-n33">33</ref> All these places are located east of longitude 117üE and between latitudes 36ü N, and 38ü N, the very district in which the mints of the coins were situated.<ref target="#CH5-n34">34</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Apart from the coins themselves several moulds of Early Knives of Ch'i have been found in recent years. Lo Chün-yü records with
<pb n="162"/>
illustrations two of bronze and two of clay.<ref target="#CH5-n35">35</ref> All these have been discovered in the territory of the ancient Ch'i state.<ref target="#CH5-n36">36</ref>
               </p>
               <p>To summarize, on the evidence of both their legends and of their provenance, the Early Knives of Ch'i, Chi-mo, An-yang and T'an are found to have been currencies of the region of the present-day Shantung Peninsula. It is significant that no type of coins other than knives have been discovered in this area.<ref target="#CH5-n36a">36a</ref>

                  <p>Lo Chün-yü reports that Ch'i knives were also found in Honan <hi rend="italic">(Yung-lu jih-cha</hi> 12a), but fails to furnish details. In a letter to the author Prof. <name type="pname">William C</name>. White also states that he acquired some large knives in Honan, but whether these knives were discovered there is not known. Even if Lo's report is reliable, it does not alter our conclusion that knives were currency of the ancient Shantung Peninsula. The Ch'i knives might have been carried beyond its borders by Ch'i merchants and they might have been accepted, to some extent, by the people of the areas adjacent to Ch'i.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">A. The Sharp-pointed Knives</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Under the general class of "Late Knives," which appeared after the "Early Knives," we have included three varieties: the "Sharp-pointed Knives" (<ref target="#fig-115">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XXXVIII, 2</ref>; XXXIX-XLI), the "Ming knives,, (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XLII—XLVI; <ref target="#fig-131">XLVII, 1</ref>), and the "Small Knives" (<ref target="#fig-135">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XLVIII, 3</ref>; XLIX-L).</p>
                  <p>The Sharp-pointed Knives are called <hi rend="italic">chien-shou tao</hi> or "pointedheaded knives" by Chinese numismatists because the end of their blade looks sharper and more pointed than the other types. Knives of this type have a mildly curved body like that of Early Knives. Some curve a little more, and some a little less. Some are slightly broader and some slightly narrower. Though it is not possible to find two specimens exactly alike in every detail, their common features are such that they can be treated as one group.</p>
                  <p>Compared with the Early Knives, Sharp-pointed Knives are small, thin and fragile. They are also much simpler in design. Most of
<pb n="163"/>
them bear a legend which usually is of one character only. Among the 91 specimens in the collection of the American Numismatic Society, 27 specimens have no legend. Of the 241 specimens illustrated in the <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'üan hui</hi> only 3 are without a legend. The characters of the various legends are usually the same as those found on the reverses of Early Knives. Some are numerals, some are from the "heavenly stems," some are from the "earthly branches," and some are other characters. While the reasons for their choice is still unknown, these characters are generally regarded as "serial marks." Chüng Chia-hsiang claims that some of them are <hi rend="italic">chu-yü</hi> or "auspicious words." <ref target="#CH5-n37">37</ref> In examining the 91 specimens in the collection of the American Numismatic Society, we found that those with the same character are of similar size and appearance, which may be taken to indicate that the characters are "serial marks" of one mint or identifying marks of different mints.</p>
                  <p>Among the Sharp-pointed Knives, there are only two specimens which have mint names as their legends, those of Lin and Liao.<ref target="#CH5-n38">38</ref> The specimen inscribed with "Lin" is illustrated in the <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'ien ta-tz'ŭ-tien,</hi> as no. 1232 (<ref target="#fig-120">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XLI, 3</ref>). That inscribed with Liao, or "Liao huo" (money of Liao) to give it in full, is reported by Chüng Chia-hsiang.<ref target="#CH5-n39">39</ref> Lin was a town in the state of Chao during the Chan-kuo period, and Liao was a town in the northwestern part of the state of Ch'i.</p>
                  <p>Except for the legend, both sides of the blade of these knives are plain. Their handle is decorated with two parallel raised lines from end to end on both obverse and reverse. At the lower end of the
<pb n="164"/>
handle is the ring. The ring and the handle are as thin and fragile as the blade and only remotely resemble either those of the real tool or those of the Early Knives.</p>
                  <p>Recently Chüng Chia-hsiang and Yü Yen reported discoveries of another type of Sharp-pointed Knives.<ref target="#CH5-n40">40</ref> For the sake of convenience we designate these newly recovered knives as Sharp-pointed Knife II. According to Chüng Chia-hsiang, the characteristics of Type II are that its blade is comparatively shorter and that the sharp point of its blade is especially long.<ref target="#CH5-n41">41</ref> Yü Yen gives a similar description of those which he has seen.<ref target="#CH5-n42">42</ref> Chüng Chia-hsiang further reports that the handle of Type II is decorated with only one line instead of the two which appear on Type I,<ref target="#CH5-n43">43</ref> while Yü Yen makes no mention of this. As to other particulars such as the characters used as legends, Type II does not differ from Type I except for slight variation in the epigraphical style.<ref target="#CH5-n44">44</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to the numismatists who provide us with the above information, specimens of Sharp-pointed Knife II were unearthed in Ch'üng-tü<ref target="#CH5-n45">45</ref> and Chang-yüan.<ref target="#CH5-n46">46</ref> Ch'üng-tü, located in southwestern Jehol, is the capital of the province. Chang-yüan (i. e., Chang-chia-k'ou), known in the West as Kalgan, is the capital of Chahar and located in the southern part of the province. Both places are not far from central Hopeh which has been reported as the provenance of the Sharp-pointed Knife I.<ref target="#CH5-n47">47</ref> During the latter part of the Chou period, central Hopeh appeared to have belonged partially to Yen and partially to Chao. The areas around Ch'üng-tü and Kalgan were adjacent to the territory of the Yen state and might have been under its control if not actually belonging to it.</p>
                  <pb n="165"/>
                  <p>Neither Chüng Chia-hsiang nor Yü Yen, who report the finds of Type II, illustrate any specimens.<ref target="#CH5-n48">48</ref> Therefore, we have no way of ascertaining the accuracy of their observations. The American Numismatic Society has in its collection six specimens with points especially sharp and long. While in this respect they resemble Type II as reported by these numismatists, they differ from them in another: their handle has the design of two raised lines as found on Type I. Whether these six specimens are variants of Type II or constitute a third group cannot be determined at the present time.</p>
                  <p>The above may be summarized as follows:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref>. Sharp-pointed Knives are of two types: Type I and Type II.</item>
                     <item>
                        <ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>. The blade of Type II is shorter than that of Type I but its point is much longer. Its handle is decorated with one raised line instead of two.</item>
                     <item>
                        <ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref>. Type I was minted either by towns in the state of Chao such as Lin or by towns neighboring Chao such as Liao, or were discovered in the northeastern part of Chao or the adjacent areas. It appears to be predominantly of Chao origin.</item>
                     <item>
                        <ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref>. Type II was unearthed in the areas which were adjacent to Yen or subjected to it. It appears to be a type of the region of Yen.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The size of Type I varies, though the great majority are similar. The <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'ien ta-tz'ŭ-tien</hi> contains an illustration of a specimen (no. 1173; see <ref target="#fig-115">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXXVIII, 2</ref>) which is 168 mm. long and 21 mm. wide, not much smaller than the large Early Knives and even longer than the small type of the Chi-mo knives. No. 1174 is similarly large, 157 mm. and 21 mm. respectively. The American Numismatic Society has four very small specimens. They measure 135, 134, 128, and 124 mm. in length respectively. They are as small as the Small Knives, the latest type of the late knives.</p>

                     <p>It should be noted that there are a few small square coins which bear the mint name of "Lin-tzŭ," which was the capital city of the state of Ch'i during the Chou period. These coins have in the past been regarded by some numismatists as of Chou origin, but there is no proof for this dating. Because the epigraphical style of the legend shows a post-Han origin, the dating to the Chou period has been discarded by leading present-day numismatists.

                  <head>B. The Ming Knives</head>
                  <p>The Ming knives are the most numerous and well-known of all Late Knives. They are so designated because they bear the character "Ming"<ref target="#CH5-n49">49</ref> on their obverse. The character <hi rend="italic">ming</hi> is made up of the signs for the sun and the moon and signified "bright," which is the usual meaning of the character. As a legend on knife coins it has puzzled many, and remains a subject of controversy. The point of dispute is whether "Ming" is the name of the mint. If it is, where was its location ? If it is not the name of a mint, what is its meaning ?</p>
                  <p>Up until very recently most, if not all, numismatists regarded "Ming" as the name of a town or mint. This opinion is supported by the way in which the legends of Early Knives and the spades are composed. We know that those legends are at least in part mint names.</p>
                  <p>Where then was the mint ? Ch'u Shang-ling regards "Ming" as an abbreviation of "P'ng-ming."<ref target="#CH5-n50">50</ref> "P'ing-ming" as the name of a city is found in the geographical section of the <hi rend="italic">Han shu</hi>, referring to a city located in present northeastern Hopeh, which in ancient <name type="place">China</name> belonged to the state of Yen. Ch'u Shang-ling asserts a place of this name might have existed during the Chan-kuo period. Thus he attributes the Ming Knives to the mint of "P'ing-ming" in the Yen state.<ref target="#CH5-n51">51</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ma Ang disagrees with Ch'u's attribution. While also reading the legend "Ming" and regarding it as a geographical name, he contends that it is the name of a city in the state of Chao during the Chan-kuo period.<ref target="#CH5-n52">52</ref> To support his argument he quotes a passage from the <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi> to the effect that in 264 B. C. Ch'in conquered two cities of Chao, one of which is indirectly identified with Hsin-ming-i or "New Ming City." It is his opinion that originally the city was
<pb n="167"/>
called "Ming-i" or "Ming City" and that after its conquest by Ch'in, the victor added the character "<hi rend="italic">hsin</hi>" for "new" to it. Thus Ma Ang attributes the origin of these knives to a town in the state of Chao.</p>
                  <p>Ma Ang's identification is more plausible than Ch'u Shang-ling's, for in abbreviating the names of cities or towns, it is always the first character that was retained, unless it is an adjective such as "old," and "new," "east" and "west," etc. The abbreviation of "P'ing-ming" into "Ming" contradicts this general practice of the ancients, as <hi rend="italic">p'ing</hi> in "P'ing-ming" is not an adjective that could be omitted.</p>
                  <p>In an article published in 1940, Chüng Chia-hsiang challenges the interpretation of "Ming" as a mint name. He offers two arguments against it. First, the provenance of the knives bearing the legend of "Ming" is very widely spread, and they were found in places which were "several thousand <hi rend="italic">li"</hi> from Chao where Ma Ang supposed they were cast. Secondly, some of the Ming knives preserved today have on their reverse legends such as <hi rend="italic">Ch'i huo</hi> (Ch'i money) and <hi rend="italic">Ch'i huo kung-chin</hi> (Ch'i money ...) (See <ref target="#fig-130">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XLVI, 2</ref>). Such specifications of another place name on their reverse side contradict the idea that "Ming" is a mint name.<ref target="#CH5-n53">53</ref> It is his opinion that "Ming" is the "general designation of the knives of Yen," adopted because, as he alleges, the character <hi rend="italic">ming</hi> implies "abundance of wealth."<ref target="#CH5-n54">54</ref> This opinion, however, cannot be confirmed.</p>
                  <p>Judging from their shape and reverse inscriptions, the Ming Knives are of three different types. Type I is angularly bent at the juncture of the blade and the handle and is inscribed with a serial mark on the back (see <ref target="#fig-123">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XLIII, 1—2; XLIV, 1</ref>); Type II has a mildly curved body and a serial mark on the reverse (see <ref target="#fig-126">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XLIV, 2</ref>; <ref target="#fig-127">XLV, 1—2</ref>; <ref target="#fig-129">XLVI, 1</ref>); and Type III has a similarly shaped body but a geographical name on the reverse such as "Ch'i" (<ref target="#fig-130">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XLVI, 2</ref> and "Ch'üng-po" <ref target="#fig-131">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XLVII, 1</ref>). The serial marks on the reverse of Type I and II are the characters <hi rend="italic">tso</hi> for left, <hi rend="italic">yu</hi> for right,
<pb n="168"/>
                     <hi rend="italic">wai</hi>... for "outside...,"<ref target="#CH5-n55">55</ref> and <graphic url="NNM122_178a.jpg"/>
                     <ref target="#CH5-n56">56</ref> On many pieces the serial marks appear alone, but more frequently are accompanied by another character or a numeral. Thus, for example, there are "Left one," "Left thirty," etc. Hence the common classification of the Ming Knives into "left series" and "right series". This, however, does not mean that Ming Knives of Type I and Type II bear no other reverse inscriptions than these serial marks.</p>
                  <p>Apart from the difference in shape (curved or angularly bent) and reverse inscriptions (serial mark or geographical name), the style of the legend "Ming" varies with different types. Three forms of the character are found: (i) flatfish <graphic url="NNM122_178b.jpg"/>, (2) round <graphic url="NNM122_178bb.jpg"/>, and (3) angular <graphic url="NNM122_178c.jpg"/> Forms 1 and 2 are the styles found on Type I and Type II, and form 3 is that found on Type III.</p>
                  <p>Many thousands of Ming Knives have been discovered in various parts of northeastern China and even in places beyond its borders. The finds sometimes contain a few pieces; sometimes they are hoards of large quantities. Ch'u Shang-ling reports that "in the ruined walls and abandoned wells of Ho-chien and I-chou they were frequently found, and many times by the thousands."<ref target="#CH5-n57">57</ref> Both I-chou (present I) and Ho-chien were located in central Hopeh Province. The excavations by an archaeological mission led by Professor Ma Hüng in 1920 in I County uncovered "very many [Ming] knives."<ref target="#CH5-n58">58</ref> Kuan Po-i discovered more than one hundred pieces in I-chou (present I County, to be distinguished from the one mentioned above) in southern Manchuria.<ref target="#CH5-n59">59</ref> An unspecified number were discovered in

                  <p>A study of provenance in relation to the different types reveals several interesting points. The table on page 170 shows the local distribution of the different types.</p>
                  <p>During the later part of the Chou period, northern Hopeh and southern Manchuria were territories of the Yen state with the area of Jehol neighboring on its north and northern <name type="place">Korea</name> on its east. Southern Hopeh and Shansi were roughly the territories of Chao, and northwestern, northern and eastern Shantung were, those of Ch'i. Bearing this in mind we easily come to the conclusion that Type I and Type II were types in circulation in the region of Yen and adjacent areas, and Type III seems to belong to Chao and Ch'i. Cheng Chia-hsiang is the numismatist who for the first time systematically worked out the local distinctions of the Ming knife coinage.<ref target="#CH5-n64">64</ref>

                  <p>Special mention must be made of the late knives of T'an and the T'an type. Illustrations of these are on <ref target="#fig-131">

                  <p>According to Füng Yün-p'üng, compiler of the <hi rend="italic">Chin shih so</hi> in which these knives were first recorded, this group was unearthed in the neighborhood of Hsiang-yü-ts'un (Fragrant-valley village) in modern Po-shan in eastern Shantung.<ref target="#CH5-n65">65</ref> The find, which consisted of "several hundred pieces," was obviously a hoard. This was the first discovery of these knives, and no later discoveries have been reported.

The inscriptions of these two specimens have been read by "some one" as <hi rend="italic">chu ch'iu ch'ang</hi>
                     <ref target="#CH5-n67">67</ref> and that of the specimen shown in <ref target="#fig-133">

                     <ref target="#CH5-n68">68</ref> Epigraphically, the reading <hi rend="italic">chu ch'iu ch'ang</hi> is absolutely impossible. While Ma Ang's decipherment of <hi rend="italic">ch'ün wu</hi> appears justifiable, his decipherment of the first character as <hi rend="italic">mai</hi> is problematical. Fang Jo suggests that the first character of the inscriptions of the specimens on <ref target="#fig-132">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XLVII, 2</ref> and <ref target="#fig-134">XLVIII, 2</ref> is <hi rend="italic">T'an,</hi> a variant form of the <hi rend="italic">T'an</hi> which is the first character in the legend of the fragmentary T'an knife previously discussed. He even goes so far as to claim that the first character in the inscription of <ref target="#fig-133">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XLVIII, 1</ref> to be a variant of the same character.<ref target="#CH5-n69">69</ref> Because he reads the character <hi rend="italic">T'an</hi>, he comes to the conclusion that these knives were issues of the town (or district) by this name.<ref target="#CH5-n70">70</ref> Although his treatment of the first characters of all the three varied inscriptions does not seem to be warranted, his reading of first characters of two of the inscriptions as <hi rend="italic">T'an</hi> is plausible, as also is his suggestion that these knives are currencies of a town or district by this name. His suggestion is strengthened by the fact that these knives were unearthed in Po-shan, a modern county which was adjacent to the capital of the ancient T'an<ref target="#CH5-n71">71</ref> and which might have been well within the area under T'an jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>The interesting point is that these knives are of the same shape and size as the Ming Knives inscribed with <hi rend="italic">Ch'i huo</hi> (money

of Ch'i) on reverse, and, like the knives of Ch'i, those of T'an bear the geographical or mint specification on the reverse. Even if "Ming" does not appear on their obverse, as on the Ming Knives of Ch'i, we can be fairly sure that in all other respects the knives of these two places are closely related, just as are the geographical locations of the two mints or districts.</p>

                  <p>As implied in the name, chosen for the sake of convenience, the knife coins belonging to this group are very small and very thin; they are even smaller and thinner than Sharp-pointed Knives. Different from other groups of knives, these have the appearance of being straight which is the reason Chinese numismatists call them "small straight knives." Many of them bear a legend on the obverse side of their blade, but many more do not. The handle on the obverse side is decorated with two parallel lines from end to end except for the group inscribed with "Ch'üng-po" which has only one line. The reverse side of both their blade and handle are plain. The raised border lines which are conspicuous on Early Knives, retained partly on Sharp-pointed Knives, can still be seen on this group of coins. The "serial marks" and the "numerals" which are found on both the Early and Sharp-pointed Knives disappear completely.</p>
                  <p>The legend is always the name of a city. The names of five cities or towns have been found: Han-tan <graphic url="NNM122_182a.jpg"/> (i. e., <graphic url="NNM122_182b.jpg"/>

                  <p>Chin-yang and Han-tan were capitals of the state of Chao at different times, and were located in central Shansi and southern Hopeh respectively.

                  <head>D. <hi rend="italic">Date of the Late Knives</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Like other questions of chronology in Chinese coinage, the dating of the Late Knives is fraught with difficulty. Again, we are handicapped by lack of literary information and reliable archaeological reports on coin discoveries. Except for the Late Knives of Lin, we shall have to make use, as best we can, of any indication, however indefinite, we can gather from the coins themselves.</p>
                  <p>As has been mentioned, some numismatists hold the opinion that the Ming Knives were a coinage of Yen. Therefore they propose that the Ming Knives which are inscribed <hi rend="italic">Ch'i</hi> on their reverses were issued by Yen for circulation in the Ch'i area.<ref target="#CH5-n72">72</ref> Their reasoning runs as follows: During the Chan-kuo period (403—221 B. C.) Ch'i and Yen waged many wars against one another, with Ch'i being usually the victor. In 284 B. C. Yen launched a large scale expedition against Ch'i and occupied the whole state except for the cities of Chi-mo and Chü on its eastern and southern borders (before this date Ch'i had annexed the ancient states of Chi-mo and Chü). Yen
<pb n="174"/>
had Ch'i under the control of its armies for some five years, from 284 to 279 B. C. Because of this fact Chinese numismatists hold the opinion that the Ming Knives with the inscription of <hi rend="italic">"Ch'i huo"</hi> (Ch'i money) on the reverse must be the occupation issues cast by Yen during the period of its control of Ch'i. This explanation would make us believe that the <hi rend="italic">"Ch'i huo"</hi> Ming Knives were coins of the beginning of the third century B. C.</p>
                  <p>While this interpretation is possible, it is equally possible that the Ming Knives of Ch'i may have been issues of the central or local authorities, or even individuals of the state, having no relations with Yen. As has been discussed before, <hi rend="italic">"Ming,"</hi> the legend, does not seem to be a mint name; it appears to be a common designation of a large group of Late Knives cast and circulated in the great part of ancient <name type="place">China</name> along the lower stretches of the Yellow River. It could have been equally possible that the legend was first adopted by the Ch'i people, with the Ming Knives of the Yen region as a later development. The shape and the design of the Ch'i Ming Knife, both of which show closer affiliations with the Early Knives of Ch'i and other states on the Shantung Peninsula, support our assumption.</p>
                  <p>Of the same shape, design and size is the specimen of the Ming Knife of Ch'üng-po illustrated in the <hi rend="italic">Ku ch'ien ta-tz'ŭ-tien</hi> (IV, no. 1065). This knife, likewise, differs from the smaller Ming Knives discovered in the Yen areas. Naturally it was not a piece of Yen currency. If the interpretation advanced by Chinese numismatists explains the origin of the Ming Knife of Ch'i, it cannot be used to explain the origin of the Ch'üng-po knife.</p>
                  <p>The Ming Knife inscribed with <hi rend="italic">"Ch'i huo"</hi> was later, and much later, than the Early Knives. This is beyond any question. The adoption of the legend of "Ming" on the obverse, the inscription of the state name on the reverse, and the smallness of its size (143 mm. long compared with the Early Knifed average length of 170) are the undeniable evidences. Although we cannot assign a definite date to the casting of knives of this type, we may not be far from the truth if we regard it as around the beginning of the Chan-kuo period.</p>
                  <pb n="175"/>
                  <p>With regard to the problem of the date of the Late Knives, the Sharp-pointed Knife of Lin offers a more satisfactory solution. As has been discussed before, Lin was seized by the ancestors of the ruling house of the state of Chao from the barbarian Ti people not earlier than 430 B. C. Therefore, its coinage cannot be earlier than this date. This opinion, of course, presupposes the non-existence of metallic coinage among the Ti people, who are said to have been itinerant cattle-breeders. We may assume then that the Sharp-pointed Knife of Lin was a coinage around 400 B. C. or later.</p>
                  <p>As we know, Lin has two types of knife coins, the Sharp-pointed Knife and the Small Knife. The Small Knife of Lin is obviously later than the Sharp-pointed Knife, but earlier than its round coin. The appearance of the round coinage in ancient <name type="place">China</name> was close to the end of the Chou period about 250 B. C. (see section on round coins). If we could tentatively assign the date of 300 B. C. to the Small Knife of Lin, we may further narrow down the date for its Sharp-pointed Knife to between 400 and 300. However, whatever its date, the Lin Sharp-pointed Knife cannot be taken as the beginning of this type of the knife coinage. The reason is that Lin, being a town newly conquered from a non-Chinese people or newly established in the northwestern border region of ancient <name type="place">China</name>, could not have been the seat of a new coinage; in other words, its Sharp-pointed Knife must have been an adoption of a coinage which already had been in circulation in the interior of <name type="place">China</name>. Therefore we may not be far from the facts to say that the commencement of the Sharp-pointed Knife may go back to the fifth century or earlier.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it may be worthwhile to point out that, in our opinion, Sharp-pointed Knives seem to be a local variety of the Late Knife coinage, contemporary with the Ming Knives, particularly those of Type III inscribed with <hi rend="italic">"Ch'i huo"</hi> and "<hi rend="italic">Ch'üng-po huo."</hi> There are three reasons. First, the Sharp-pointed Knives have never been reported to have been discovered in Shantung where the Ming Knife III and the T'an Late Knife (which is of the same design save for the legend and similar size as Ming Knife III) circulated; secondly,
<pb n="176"/>
mints such as Lin, which cast the Sharp-pointed Knife and the Small Knife are not found to have cast the Ming Knife; thirdly, Li Tso-hsien reports that a hoard composed of Ming Knives and Sharp-pointed Knives was discovered in the neighborhood of the imperial capital of Peking in the Tao-kuang period, as has been mentioned before. Some of the specimens from the hoard which he later obtained must have been illustrated in the Sharp-pointed Knife section of his coin catalogue, although he does not specify any particular specimens as such.</p>

                  <head>E. <hi rend="italic">Expansion of the Knife Coinage</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>In dealing with the Early Knives we found that the knife was exclusively a coinage of the states on the ancient Shantung Peninsula. How, then, did it happen that a later date, say from the fifth century on, the Late Knife coinage came to be the coinage not only of the Shantung Peninsula, specifically of the state of Ch'i, but also of the regions of Chao and Yen? In answering this question we will find that at about the end of the Ch'un-ch'iu period (481 B. C.) the knife coinage of Ch'i had spread beyond its borders and penetrated areas where the spade had been the sole type of metallic currency.</p>
                  <p>The states of Chao and Yen were to the west and northwest of the borders of Ch'i. One of the Chao cities which adopted the knife coinage was Han-tan located southwest of its present county seat namesake in southern Hopeh close to the border of Ch'i. From 386 B. C. onwards it was the capital of the Chao state and was one of the few important cities mentioned by Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien in his historical account of the development of trade and industry.</p>
                  <p>It was an iron producing center and a trading center for the handicraft products of that region, especially for the area to its north. Among the preserved coins of Han-tan there are Type I of Hollow-handle Spade recorded by Li Tso-hsien,<ref target="#CH5-n73">73</ref> Type I of the Late Spade
<pb n="177"/>
(<ref target="#fig-67">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XX, 4</ref>) and the Small Knives (<ref target="#fig-135">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XLVIII, 3</ref>). As the latest Hollow-handle Spade, such as that of the Eastern Chou dates no later than 400 B. C. and the date of the Hollow-handle Spade of Han-tan may go back to the early years of the Chou period, and as the Small Knife, the latest of all knife coinages, cannot be earlier than 400 B. C., it is evident that Han-tan had been issuing spade coins as its currency at an early date, and its Small Knife coinage was obviously a later adoption.</p>
                  <p>The reason for the adoption of knife coinage by cities of Chao cannot be stated with certainty. Probably it was caused by the expanding economic and military power of Ch'i where, ever since the establishment of that state, knife coins had circulated exclusively. By the beginning of the fifth century, Ch'i seems to have conquered and annexed practically all the states to its east, T'an in 684 and Lai and T'ang in 567 and extended its borders into the very heart of Chi-mo before 522. It thus monopolized the fishing industry and the production of salt from the sea, and stimulated production in fields of handicrafts, such as silk. As trade in these commodities developed, "both people and wealth came to it," to use Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien's words.<ref target="#CH5-n74">74</ref> "They (people) came carrying their children on their backs and converged on it like the spokes of a wheel." "As a result, Ch'i provided the world with hats, sashes, clothes and slippers. The people between the sea and Mount T'ai (in central Shantung) came hand in hand to pay their homage."<ref target="#CH5-n75">75</ref> The state of Ch'i remained "wealthy and powerful through the reigns of King Wei (357—320 B. C.) and King Hsüan (219—201 B. C.)."<ref target="#CH5-n76">76</ref> At the time of King Hsüan, Lin-tzŭ, the capital of the state, became perhaps the richest and the most prosperous city in the world then known to the Chinese. The traffic on the roads to Lin-tzŭ was so crowded that, in the words of Su
<pb n="178"/>
Ch'in (d. 317 B. C.), the wheels of carriages bumped on each other, and the shoulders of the people rubbed one another. This developed commerce was the reason why the year's revenue from the taxes on the market which Duke Huan bestowed upon Kuan Chung made the minister richer than the prince of a state. Therefore, in 288 B. C. only Ch'i could compete with the all powerful state of <name type="place">Ch'in</name>, and its ruler assumed the title of <hi rend="italic">Ti</hi> (Emperor) to match the ruler of Ch'in who had adopted the same title. It is only natural that the power of Ch'i exerted great economic influence on its neighbor and caused Chao to cast knife coins so as to facilitate trade with Ch'i. Like Han-tan, other cities and towns in the state of Chao must have also adopted the knife coinage. Two of these, Chin-yang and Lin, have been discussed before. Unfortunately, knife coins of other Chao towns, if they existed, have not come down to us.</p>
                  <p>What has been said of Chao applies also to Yen; only in this case a more intimate relationship is witnessed by many events, some of which are wars. The early relations between Yen and Ch'i are not recorded. During the period of the hegemony of Ch'i, Yen was under its friendly influence. On behalf of Yen, Duke Huan repelled the invasions of the Ku-chu people from the northwest. On Duke Huan's return the ruler of Yen escorted him with great respect across the border of his own state into Ch'i. In later years the peaceful domination of Yen by <hi rend="italic">Ch'i</hi> gave place to wars, the first one of which on a large scale seems to have started in 536 B. C. when the prince of Ch'i attacked Yen. During the Chan-kuo period Ch'i and Yen were in constant struggle with each other. In 333 B. C. Ch'i armies fell upon Yen and conquered ten cities of the latter; in 314 B. C. Ch'i again attacked, caused the death of its king and the heir-apparent, and brought the state under Ch'i's control. Ironically enough, wars, in spite of their destructiveness, are sometimes carriers of civilization and agents of further economic development. In addition to the commercial contact between the two states, which must have been frequent and close at the time, struggles either diplomatic or military may have contributed much to the adoption by one of the coinage
<pb n="179"/>
of another. In this case again, the state which exerted the greater strength was Ch'i.</p>
                  <p>Such may be the conditions under which the knife coinage of Ch'i spread into Chao and Yen, and became a dominant currency in what is now known as the whole of north <name type="place">China</name>, southern <name type="place">Manchuria</name> and even northern <name type="place">Korea</name>. We use the word "dominant" advisedly, because the towns of Chao and Yen, both originally in the spade area, did not abandon their old coinage after adopting the knives for trading purposes. Chin-yang and Lin may be cited as examples of mints for which Late Spades and Late Knives exist, both dating in the fourth and third centuries. When later the round coinage made its appearance in the old spade area towards the end of the Chan-kuo period, the monetary unit was still the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> of the spade coinage and not the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> which was the monetary designation of the knife and the monetary unit of the round coinage on the old knife area.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We have found that the knife was originally a coinage of states on the Shantung peninsula and that the spade was the same for the royal domain of Chou and the states of Chin, Chüng, Wei, Sung, Lu and other minor feudatories. During the Chan-kuo period, knife coinage was adopted by Chao and Yen for use alongside their original coinage of spades. There was one large area, the state of Ch'u,<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> in which neither knife nor spade coinage circulated. Some scholars, among them Lo Chün-yü, believe that Ch'u, being a state of southern barbarian origin, had no coinage of its own.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>During the period of the Sung dynasty, however, small flat pieces of gold bearing stamp-like marks were found within the Chin area. Their discovery was first reported by Shün Kuo (1030—1094), who states that they were found in considerable numbers on the slopes of the Pa-kung Hills, in the Huai River and in the valley streams of Shou-chou (present Shou County in central Anhui Province).<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref> The popular explanation first made of these pieces was that they were the so-called "medicine gold" of the Taoist king of Huai-nan, named Liu An (d. 122 B. C.), of the Han period.<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref> He is said to have attempted to extract a potion for longevity from gold. This traditional explanation prevailed until 1878 when Fang Chün-i, a noted epigraphical
<pb n="181"/>
scholar, on deciphering their inscriptions concluded that they were money of Ch'u.<ref target="#CH6-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The inscriptions are the so-called "stamps." They are of three varities: <hi rend="italic">Yin yüan</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_191a.jpg"/> (Yüan of Yin), <hi rend="italic">Ch'ün Yüan</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_191b.jpg"/> (Yüan of Ch'ün) and, as some numismatists assert, <hi rend="italic">Shou-ch'un</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_191c.jpg"/>. <hi rend="italic">Yüan</hi> was a unit of weight as well as a monetary designation or unit in ancient <name type="place">China</name>. As a monetary unit in literary sources it first appears in the Lü-hsing chapter of <hi rend="italic">Shang-shu.</hi> It is as a monetary unit or designation that it must have been used on the "Yüan Chin."</p>
            <p>The presence in the "stamps" of the names of Ying and Ch'ün, cities of the kingdom of Ch'u, led Fang Chün-i to the conclusion that these gold pieces were the official currency of that state. Ying, an ancient city located north of the county seat of modem Chiangling in southern Hupeh on the Yangtze River, was an early capital of the state of Ch' u.Ch'ün, the modern county seat of Huai-yang in eastern Honan, became the capital of Ch'u in 278 B. C. Fang's attribution is confirmed by the fact that the majority of finds of "Yüan Chin" have been made in the area around Shou-ch'un, the state's last capital. Shou-ch'un, a city located in the present Shou County in central Anhui, was the capital of Ch'u from 242 B. C. to 223 B. C. when Ch'u was conquered by Ch'in.</p>
            <p>The original name of this money is not known. Up to the present, Chinese numismatists have not found a completely satisfactory appellation for it. Popularly, it has been called <hi rend="italic">yin-tzŭ-chin</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_191d.jpg"/> (stamped gold), <hi rend="italic">ping-chin</hi>

               <graphic url="NNM122_191f.jpg"/> (gold plate).<ref target="#CH6-n6">6</ref> Fang Chün-i identifies it with the <hi rend="italic">ping-chin</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_191g.jpg"/> mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Erh-ya.</hi> Because the <hi rend="italic">Erh-ya</hi> states that "<hi rend="italic">Ping-chin</hi> is called <hi rend="italic">pan</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_191h.jpg"/>" and the character <hi rend="italic">pan</hi> might be written as <graphic url="NNM122_191i.jpg"/>, he further identifies the money with the <hi rend="italic">chin-pan</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_191j.jpg"/> mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Chou li.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH6-n7">7</ref> In this work it is said when the <hi rend="italic">lü</hi> sacrifice was offered

to the "God on High," the <hi rend="italic">Chih-chin</hi> (keeper of gold) presented his <hi rend="italic">chin-pan. Chin-pan</hi> here may be rendered as "gold plate."</p>
            <p>We hesitate to accept Fang's identification for the following reasons. First, there is no proof for the identification except the similarities between the popular names of this money and the terms found in the <hi rend="italic">Erh-ya</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Chou li</hi>. Secondly, even if the <hi rend="italic">Chou li</hi> statement is reliable, it is rather inconceivable that the "Son of Heaven," or the "Heavenly King" as the king of Chou was also called, should offer the "God on High" money of one of his vassal states. Thirdly, in all probability the <hi rend="italic">chin-pan</hi> recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Chou li</hi> was gold bullion cast in the form of plates like some of the silver ingots of the T'ang period.</p>
            <p>Some Chinese historians<ref target="#CH6-n8">8</ref> have accepted Fang Chün-i's suggestion though Chinese numismatists have not followed it. Numismatists such as Lo Po-chao and Wang Yin-chia call the Ch'u money <hi rend="italic">yüan chin</hi>, or "<hi rend="italic">yüan</hi> money."<ref target="#CH6-n9">9</ref> The popular name, <hi rend="italic">ping-chin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chin-ping</hi>, both of which may be rendered "gold plate" or "metal plate" may be more practical, but scientifically the apellation <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> seems preferable. Needless to say, it cannot be considered to be the original name of the currency at the time of its use.</p>
            <p>Most of the <hi rend="italic">yüan chin</hi> of Ch'u unearthed to date are of gold. Those reported by Shün K'uo, Fang Chün-i and Lo Chün-yü are all of this precious metal.<ref target="#CH6-n10">10</ref> Wang Yin-chia reports in 1943 that a man named Rung, a native of Ho-fei, Anhui, "gathered more than thirty pieces,"<ref target="#CH6-n11">11</ref> all of which seem to be of the same metal judging from the name he gives for them, <hi rend="italic">chin yüan</hi> or "gold <hi rend="italic">yüan"</hi> In his work, <hi rend="italic">Hüng-chai chin shih shih hsiao-lu,</hi> Huang Chün illustrates a specimen which is said to be of copper and another which is noted as of lead.<ref target="#CH6-n12">12</ref> Shang
<pb n="183"/>
Ch'üng-tso mentions a silver piece with the "stamp" of <hi rend="italic">Ying yüan</hi> in the possession of Ts'ai Chi-hsiang.<ref target="#CH6-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Clay imitations of the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> have been discovered in Ch'ang-sha, Hunan, in the Ch'u tombs of the Chan-kuo period. In his work, <hi rend="italic">Ch'ang-sha ku-wu wün-chien chi</hi>, Shang Ch'üng-tso reports that many clay imitations have been found, and that he himself has seen a few. One piece, with sixteen "stamps," measures 65 mm. long, 64 mm. wide, and 5 mm. thick. Like the original, each "stamp" contains two characters which read <hi rend="italic">Ying yüan</hi> in reverse. The other pieces are broken, bearing the same "stamp." All of them are of "yellow earth," to make them, as Shang Ch'üng-tso explains, resemble the real gold pieces. As he has also pointed out, they were made for use as funeral money (53a-54a). Ch'ün Müg-chia declares that the Ch'ang-sha tombs of Ch'u probably belong to the reign of King Huai (328—299 B. C.), before the state moved its capital to Ch'ün in 278 B. C. And that is reason, so he says, why in those tombs only the imitations of the <hi rend="italic">yüan chin</hi> of Ying were discovered (See Ch'ün's preface to Shang's work).</p>
            <p>We have no way of determining the authenticity of the copper and the lead specimens. Even if they are genuine, we are still ignorant whether they were actually used as money. Shang Ch'üng-tso asserts that they are funeral money made for those who could not afford to use the real gold currency for burial purposes.<ref target="#CH6-n14">14</ref> This may or may not be true. If copper and lead pieces were funeral money, the same cannot be said of the silver specimen (if it is genuine) reported by him. While it is not entirely impossible that Ch'u had a multi-metallic currency, it is interesting that the specimens of the Ch'u money preserved today are chiefly of gold.</p>
            <p>According to the literary sources of the Chou period, gold was used as a medium of exchange in all of ancient <name type="place">China</name>. But the <hi rend="italic">yüan chin</hi> of Ch'u are the only specimens in the form of a currency that have come down to us. If other regions used gold at all, it must have been in bulk form as bullion. That Ch'u used gold as currency
<pb n="184"/>
seems natural, as from remote antiquity the area south of the Chiang (Yangtze River) was known as a source of gold supply. In the <hi rend="italic">Shih ching</hi> the metal which the Huai barbarians offered to Lu as tribute is called <hi rend="italic">nan-chin,<ref target="#CH6-n15">15</ref>
               </hi> which term can be interpreted as meaning "gold from the south." In the <hi rend="italic">Yü-kung,</hi> a chapter in the present text of the <hi rend="italic">Shang-shu,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi> the metal is called <hi rend="italic">huang chin</hi> or "yellow metal."<ref target="#CH6-n16">16</ref> The <hi rend="italic">Kuan-tzŭ</hi> states that the <hi rend="italic">chin,</hi> i. e., <hi rend="italic">huang-chin,</hi> was produced in the regions of the Ju and the Han Rivers,<ref target="#CH6-n17">17</ref> both in the territory of Ch'u. Inscriptions of four Chou bronzes record the capture of <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> in the military campaigns against the "Southern Huai Barbarians," the K'uai and the Ching (i. e. Ch'u).<ref target="#CH6-n18">18</ref> It is not impossible that this metal was gold.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">yüan chin</hi> vary in size. The smallest bears one stamp-like mark which contains the name of its mint and its monetary designation, <hi rend="italic">yüan.</hi> One such piece may be regarded as a unit. Larger pieces bear two or more identical stamps and are thus to be considered as multiples. There are known so far pieces of two, six, fourteen and sixteen units.<ref target="#CH6-n19">19</ref> Shün K'uo reports one gold piece with "more than twenty stamps."<ref target="#CH6-n20">20</ref> LoPo-chao maybe correct in his opinion that the larger pieces, in actual use, were broken into differentsized denominations as desired.<ref target="#CH6-n21">21</ref> However, there is one point against his suggestion, the fact that, as far as available information shows, no two units have been found of the same weight. Fang Chün-i weighed five specimens all of which are one-stamp pieces. The following are their weights.<ref target="#CH6-n22">22</ref>

            <p>The fact that the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> of one "stamp" or one denomination varies in weight need not necessarily negate Lo Po-chao's suggestion, for it would be well-nigh impossible to break from a large piece small ones of uniform weight or size.</p>
            <p>The monetary unit <hi rend="italic">yüan</hi> appears also to have undergone considerable reduction in weight in the course of many centuries. Wu Ta-ch'üng states thahe measured one <hi rend="italic">yüan chin</hi> with the legend of <hi rend="italic">Ying yüan</hi>, which is said to have been discovered in Füng-t'ai County in northern Anhui. Its weight is 1.96 <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> in the local scale of Hunan,<ref target="#CH6-n23">23</ref> his native province. According to the weight of the one-<hi rend="italic">liang</hi> silver dollar of Kashgar struck in the Hunan scale by Tso Tsung-t'ang,<ref target="#CH6-n24">24</ref> a general and statesman from Hunan at the end of the Manchu dynasty, 1.96 <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> is 73.155 grams. This is incomparably heavier than any of the pieces weighed by Fang Chün-i, and the size of its illustration given by Wu is also much larger. If this specimen is genuine, then it must be an early issue because of its heavy weight; for it is only natural to assume that coins of heavier weight are earlier than those of lighter weight.</p>
            <p>However, the information about the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> is so scanty that it is advisable to restrain speculation. At the moment we may have to satisfy ourselves with this superficial observation that the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> were a money of the Ch'u state, that <hi rend="italic">yüan</hi> in the legend appears
<pb n="186"/>
to be both a monetary designation and a monetary unit, and that the weight of the money might have decreased some time after the coinage was established.</p>
            <p>When was the coinage established ? Here we face the same difficulties we have faced in considering the origins of other coinages. The reason is obvious; there is simply no information. Above we have found that Ying and Ch'ün in the legends of the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> were capitals of the state of Ch'u at different times, and that as capital of Ch'u, Ying was much earlier than Ch'ün. Thus by finding the date at which Ying became the capital of Ch'u we may be able to set the earliest limit for the coinage of the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In early Chinese historical literature there are two different statements on the date of the establishment of Ying as Ch'us capital. The <hi rend="italic">Shih-pün</hi> is quoted to have recorded it as during King Wu's (740—690 B. C.) time,<ref target="#CH6-n25">25</ref> and Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien and Pan Ku report that it was during King Wün's (689—677 B. C.) reign.<ref target="#CH6-n26">26</ref> In any case the date cannot be earlier than 740 B. C., and this then, may well be taken as the earliest possible date for the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The date of establishment of Ch'ün as the capital may serve as the clue to how long the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> coinage was in circulation. It is, of course, the assumption that the Ch'ün in the legend of "Ch'ün yüan" was the Ch'ün which became the capital of Ch'u in 278 B. C.<ref target="#CH6-n27">27</ref> Ch'ün remained the capital probably until 242 B. C., when it was superseded by Shou-ch'un. While the date of the abandonment of Ch'ün as the capital of Ch'u cannot be taken as the terminal date for the use of <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> in Ch'u it does indicate that as late as 243 B. C. the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> was still in circulation.</p>

               <p>Originally Ch'u was a small state above the Yangtze River in Hupeh Province. In the course of time it expanded constantly at the expense of its northern and eastern neighbors until during the Ch'un-ch'iu period its territory roughly covered the entire province. During the Chan-kuo period its boundaries expanded to Kiangsu in the east, southern Shantung in the northeast, and central Honan in the north.</p>

            <p>The round coin, the last type to appear in the Chou period, circulated in both the spade and the knife areas. With its appearance <name type="place">China</name> entered the period of monetary unification which heralded the unification in political organization accomplished in 221 B. C.</p>
            <p>Round coins of the Chou period had a regional individuality similar to that manifested in the coinages before, namely, the spade in the west and the knife in the east. While there is a plain reverse on all the round coins, major differences occur in their monetary units and the shape of their central holes. In the west the monetary unit is either the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi>, both of which are units of spades of two districts within that area. The central hole is round with some later issues having a square hole. In the east, the monetary unit is the <hi rend="italic">huo,</hi> which is the exclusive monetary designation found on the knives. The shape of the central hole is square. So far, not a single specimen in the knife area has been reported with a round central hole. With these local characteristics in mind, reconstruction of the round coinages of the Chou period will be easier.</p>

               <head>1. THE ROUND COINS OF THE KNIFE AREA</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> LI—LII</p>
               <p>In the knife area, the round coins preserved today are those with the legends of "I Huo" — <graphic url="NNM122_197a.jpg"/> (one <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>), "Ming Huo" <graphic url="NNM122_197b.jpg"/> (Ming <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>), and "I Huo" <graphic url="NNM122_197c.jpg"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">(huo</hi> of I). Of the three inscriptions the last is the most important in determining whether or not these round coins are of the knife area.</p>
               <p>A. Round coins of I (<ref target="#fig-150">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LI, 6—9</ref>). These coins are of various sizes with correspondingly different denominations. All of them
<pb n="188"/>
have a square central hole and a plain reverse. Except for some of the one-unit coins, found in the collection of The American Numismatic Society, all have rims around both the central hole and the outer circumference.</p>
               <p>The legend on the coins is made up of the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> and its denomination, and the mint name I <graphic url="NNM122_198a.jpg"/> in modern script). In the past the character for the mint name has been read as <hi rend="italic">pao</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_198b.jpg"/> by most numismatists, as <hi rend="italic">p'üng-pei</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_198c.jpg"/> by Ts'ai Yün,<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> and as <hi rend="italic">yen</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_198d.jpg"/> by Ma Ang;<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> but all of these readings have been proved incorrect.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The reading as <hi rend="italic">pao</hi> is based on the result of a superficial resemblance of the character for the mint name I to the character for <hi rend="italic">pao,</hi> and of an inference from a statement made by Pan Ku (32—90). In the <hi rend="italic">Han shu</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">(History of Han)</hi> Pan Ku says that the "big coin" cast by King Ching of Chou in 524 B. C. was inscribed <hi rend="italic">pao huo.<hi rend="sup"/>
                  </hi>
                  <ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref> Because of this reference and the resemblance between the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pao</hi> characters, numismatists have readily believed that the coin inscribed with <hi rend="italic">I Huo</hi> was the Chou coin inscribed with <hi rend="italic">pao huo.</hi> This belief was first expressed by Hung Tsun and is still cherished by some contemporary numismatists, among them the noted Chüng Chia-hsiang.</p>
               <p>Pan Ku's statement was rejected by Wei Chao (third century) as "not factual,"<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> and proved beyond any doubt as false by Ts'ai Yün and Sun I-jang (1848—1908), both historians and epigraphers with considerable knowledge of coins. Sun I-jang points out that the character <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> mistakenly read by numismatists as <hi rend="italic">pao,</hi> is structurally completely different from the latter character as it appears in the inscriptions on Chou bronzes.<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref> Considering the various forms of the character <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Chou wün,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Shou-wün chieh-tzŭ</hi> and
<pb n="189"/>
the <hi rend="italic">Han shu</hi>, he concludes that the character on the coin must be the old form of <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_199a.jpg"/> pronounced the same.<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref> By old form he means the original form of the character without the component <hi rend="italic">pei</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_199b.jpg"/> (cowry) as it appears in the legend on some of the Hollow-handle Spades.<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> The component <hi rend="italic">pei</hi> is a later addition, which does not alter the meaning of the character.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref>
               </p>
               <p>I as a geographical name is not found in Chou literature, but Ting Fu-pao found a county of Han by this name in the geographical section of the <hi rend="italic">Han shu.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref> The county seat, I, was located northwest of the county seat of present Shou-kuang in northeastern Shantung. Most likely the town existed during the Chou period in the territory of the state of Ch'i. Thus I is found to be a town in Ch'i during the Chan-kuo period.</p>
               <p>The belief that I was in the territory of Ch'i has been previously expressed by Liu Hsin-yüan, whose conclusion is based on the provenance of the moulds of the coins of I and on a pottery jar with the stamp <hi rend="italic">"i"</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref> which was found in Wei County, southeast of the ancient town of I.<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref> Moulds of the I coins of the "four <hi rend="italic">huo"</hi> and "six <hi rend="italic">huo"</hi> denominations are reported by Li Tso-hsien to have been found "on the coast of the eastern sea" (meaning the Shantung Peninsula).<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> Wüng Shu-p'ei reports another mould of the "six <hi rend="italic">huo'<hi rend="sup"/>
                  </hi> denomination to have been discovered in Chiao-chou in the eastern part of the Shantung peninsula.<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> An I coin of "one <hi rend="italic">huo"</hi> denomination
<pb n="190"/>
is reported by Li Tso-hsien to have been found in the same place with the moulds.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, study of the legends, the provenance, and moulds of the coins lead us to the conclusion that the round coins inscribed with the mint name of I were not coins of Chou but coins of a town in Ch'i by the name of I.</p>
               <p>The coins of I are of four denominations — one, two, four, and six. The smallest denomination is inscribed <hi rend="italic">"I Huo"</hi> or "(One) <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of I" <ref target="#fig-150">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LI, 6</ref>). The two<hi rend="italic">-huo</hi> denomination (<ref target="#fig-152">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LI, 8</ref>) is inscribed with <hi rend="italic">"I Erh Huo"</hi> or "Two <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of I." The four<hi rend="italic">-huo</hi> denomination (<ref target="#fig-151">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LI, 7</ref>) is inscribed with <hi rend="italic">"I Ssŭ Huo"</hi> or'Tour <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of I." And the si<hi rend="italic">x-huo</hi> denomination (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LI,9) is inscribed with <hi rend="italic">"I LiuHuo"</hi> or "Six <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of I." Coins of one-, four-and six-<hi rend="italic">huo</hi> denominations are common. The two<hi rend="italic">-huo</hi> denomination is known to us only from a rare specimen in the collection of The American Numismatic Society. With this specimen we are able to complete the series of I coins and their denominational system which may be the same as the system of other mints in the knife area.</p>
               <p>B. "Ming" round coins (<ref target="#fig-154">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> LI, 10—11</ref>; <ref target="#fig-156">LII, 1—2</ref>). These coins differ from the coins of I—no specimen of the coins preserved today has rims—, but they both have square central holes and plain reverses.</p>
               <p>Specimens of these coins are generally seen with the legend <hi rend="italic">"Ming Huo"</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_200a.jpg"/> (<ref target="#fig-154">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LI, 10</ref>). The character <hi rend="italic">"Ming"</hi> (on the right side in the legend) is the same one found on thousands of Ming knives, and it must have the same meaning. The character <hi rend="italic">"huo"</hi> (on the left side) has been variously read as <hi rend="italic">yüeh</hi> for "moon,"<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref>
                  <hi rend="italic">i</hi> for "town or city,"<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref>
                  <hi rend="italic">hsi</hi> for "evening,"<ref target="#CH7-n18">18</ref> and <hi rend="italic">tao</hi> for "knife."<ref target="#CH7-n19">19</ref>
                  <pb n="191"/>
However, a close examination will reveal that the character written <graphic url="NNM122_201a.jpg"/> with the short stroke straight and not connected with the longer and curved stroke, as it appears on some specimens, is the left part of the original complete character <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_201b.jpg"/>, which, as a monetary designation, appears as the last character on all legends of the Early Knives. It is the abbreviated form of the latter. In the same short form <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> appears in the legends on some of the Small Knives and in the legend of the "One <hi rend="italic">Huo</hi>" coins (see below). This abbreviated character appearing in the legends of the Small Knives and the "One <hi rend="italic">Huo</hi>" coins has never been misread, it is rather strange that it should have been misread on the "Ming" coins.</p>
               <p>On some "Ming" coins the character <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> is written <graphic url="NNM122_201c.jpg"/>, for example, (<ref target="#fig-156">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LII, 1</ref>) with the shorter stroke curved and connected with the longer one. This obviously was caused by the symmetrical and artistic instinct of the designer or mouldmaker, who, by curving the shorter stroke to match the curved form of the upper part of the character <hi rend="italic">"Ming"</hi> achieved an harmonious pattern in the whole legend. This style over a lengthy span of time had acquired something of the nature of a conventional design.</p>
               <p>Like the coins of I, "Ming" coins appear to have consisted of various denominations and consequently various sizes as indicated by the existence of the coin specimen inscribed with the legend, <hi rend="italic">Ming Ssŭ</hi> or "Ming four" (<ref target="#fig-157">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LII, 2</ref>). Here again the monetary unit may be the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>; i. e., "Ming four" means "Ming, four <hi rend="italic">huo."</hi> The measurements of the picture of the specimen, which is made from a rubbing, is 29 mm. in diameter, almost the same as that of the f<hi rend="italic">our-huo</hi> coin of I which is 30 mm. in diameter. This suggests the possibility that the "Ming" coins might also have two<hi rend="italic">-huo</hi> and si<hi rend="italic">x-huo</hi> denominations.</p>
               <p>In 1928 in the excavation of the Mu-yang-ch'üng site on the Liaotung Peninsula in southern Manchuria, three "Ming" round coins were discovered, together with fourteen broken pieces of "Ming" knives at the same spot and on the same level.<ref target="#CH7-n20">20</ref> This is indisputable
<pb n="192"/>
evidence that "Ming" round coins were in circulation where "Ming" knives had been and still were during the last years of the Chou period.</p>
               <p>C. "One <hi rend="italic">Huo"</hi> round coins (<ref target="#fig-158">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LII, 3</ref>). This group has the square central hole characteristic of the coins of the knife area, rims, and plain reverse. They bear no mint name: their legend contains only the denomination, <hi rend="italic">I Huo</hi> or "one <hi rend="italic">huo."</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH7-n21">21</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the remains of Kao-li-chai on the Liaotung Peninsula, twenty-three "One <hi rend="italic">Huo"</hi> specimens were unearthed. Some of these were found together with "Ming" knives in trench D.<ref target="#CH7-n22">22</ref> Two specimens were discovered in the remains of Mu-yang-ch'üng also on the Liaotung Peninsula. They were found on the same spot with "Ming" knives and "Ming" round coins.<ref target="#CH7-n23">23</ref> Evidently all were currencies which had circulated in the same area.</p>
               <p>Since the coins are inscribed "One <hi rend="italic">Huo,"</hi> there must have been coins of other denominations; otherwise, the specification of "one <hi rend="italic">huo"</hi> would be meaningless. What the complete denominational system of this group of coins actually was is a matter that may be gauged from that of I coins, and cannot be said with absolute certainty.</p>
               <p>From the above descriptions of individual groups we make the following general observations: (1) all of the round coins hitherto described have the same monetary unit <hi rend="italic">ühuo,</hi> which had been an exclusive monetary designation of the knife coinage; (2) all have a square central hole; (3) both the location of the mint and the provenance of the moulds and the coins of I are in the old territory of Ch'i, the original area of knife coinage; (4) both the "Ming" round coins and the "One Huo" round coins have been discovered together with "Ming" knives in the area where the knife had become the dominant currency during the last years of the Chou period. We can conclude therefore that these coins belong to one general category, which is to be regarded as the round coinage of the knife area.</p>

               <head>2. ROUND COINS OF THE SPADE AREA</head>
               <p>Their variations in design and differences in monetary units permit us to divide the round coins of the spade area into several groups. Except for our last group (E), which are coins of the state of Ch'in, the order of arrangement of the various groups also represents the sequence of their appearance so far as we can judge.</p>
               <p>A. Coins with a round central hole and without a rim.</p>
               <p>These coins constitute the bulk of the round coinage from the spade area during the Chou period. They were minted by eleven cities and feudatories as listed in the following table:</p>

               <p>The decipherment of "An-hsiang" is still uncertain, as is also "Yin-p'ing." Fang Jo who possessed the specimen with the latter legend reads it as "Wu-P'ing."<ref target="#CH7-n24">24</ref> The specimen with the legend "Chin (-yang)" was also in the possession of Fang Jo, who states that there are traces of another character below "Chin" covered with heavy rust.<ref target="#CH7-n25">25</ref> The reason we suggest "yang" as the second character is that Chin-yang, one of the most important mints for which spades and knives have been preserved, is the only known mint name beginning with "chin."</p>
               <p>The coins in this group are of two sizes. Since the large coins of Ch'ang-yüan and Yü are inscribed "one <hi rend="italic">chin"</hi> or "<hi rend="italic">chin</hi>" and are obviously of one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denomination, the large coins of similar size from other mints in the same area must also be based on the same monetary unit and be of the same denomination, even though they are not so inscribed. A small coin of Chi-yin (<ref target="#fig-164">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LIII, 1</ref>) in the Museum of The American Numismatic Society weighs 4.65 grams, approximately half of the larger coin of the same mint which weighs 10.20 grams. Originally it may have weighed just half of the latter. Therefore, it and the smaller sized coins of other mints must be a half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> in denomination.</p>
               <p>B. Coins with round central hole but with rims.</p>
               <p>Of this type, coins are preserved for the following mints:</p>

               <p>Except for Hsi-Chou, the other three mints have been listed in the table showing the distribution of mints of the spades; they were mints of the spade area. Hsi-Chou which was located in northern Honan just west of the royal capital of Chou was also in the spade area. Lin round coins without rims are found in our Group A; those with rims in the present group (B) we believe to be the later of the two issues.</p>
               <p>C. Coins with square central hole but without rims.</p>
               <p>Of this type of coin only one of Chou has been reported.<ref target="#CH7-n26">26</ref> The legend on this piece reads <hi rend="italic">Chou Huo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_205a.jpg"/> or <hi rend="italic">"Huo</hi> of Chou." At the time the coin was cast, the royal domain of Chou had been reduced to a small area in the central part of present northern Honan, where its capital, Lo-i, was located. Lo-i had been in the center of the spade area. The square central hole of the coin was most likely a later adoption from the design of the round coinage of the knife area. The influence of the knife area coinage upon this type of coins is also evidenced by its use of the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>.</p>
               <p>D. Coins with square central hole and rims.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LIV, 4</ref>) have been preserved. The design of these coins shows further influence of the coin design of the knife area in the east upon the coins of the spade area in the west, since both the square central hole and the rims are marked characteristics of the round coins of the knife area and are not found on the early issues of the round coins of the spade area.</p>

of 24 <hi rend="italic">chu.</hi> The appearance of that monetary unit on this group of round coins implies that these coins were developed from Ch'in spades. Shensi, the home territory of Ch'in, is their reported provenance,<ref target="#CH7-n27">27</ref> and this adds much weight to the assumption. The specimen inscribed with the legend "Weight, twelve <hi rend="italic">chu,"</hi> which equals a half <hi rend="italic">liang,</hi> must have been the immediate forerunner of the Pan-liang (half <hi rend="italic">liang)</hi> coin of imperial Ch'in, which was the first Ch'in coinage issued after ancient <name type="place">China</name> was conquered and unified in 221 B. C. Like this coin, the imperial Pan-liang coin of Ch'in also has a square central hole.</p>
               <p>Unlike other coins of the spade area they do not bear mint names. This is exceedingly interesting and significant, and is most likely a reflection of the political structure of Ch'in at the time these coins were cast. The history of the state of Ch'in shows that after the latter part of the fourth century B. C. Ch'in was a centralized state.
<pb n="197"/>
In 336 B. C. coinage was made a state prerogative, and thereupon the special form of spade with three holes was cast. At the beginning of this innovation the old tradition persisted, and the unified spade coinage of Ch'in still bore the names of local mints, which were very likely the mints which cast them under a central supervision. With the appearance of the round coinage, the king's monopoly on coinage seems to have been tightened further, with minting probably concentrated at the capital. The centralization of minting at the capital or under the sole power of the king meant the abolition of local minting privileges. This is probably the reason for the absence of local mint names in the legend of the coins. As a matter of fact, the centralization of minting would make the very specification of mint unnecessary. The absence of mint name on the universal Pan-liang coin of imperial Ch'in serves as a good example.</p>
               <p>Besides the various types of the round coins described and discussed above, there is one more type (<ref target="#fig-180">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LV, 5</ref>, <ref target="#fig-182">7</ref>)which should be mentioned. These coins have a round central hole, some with and some without rims. All of them bear the same legend, <hi rend="italic">"Pan yüan"</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_207a.jpg"/> or "Half, round." The second character of the legend, <hi rend="italic">yüan,</hi> though slightly varied, is structurally identical with the <hi rend="italic">yüan</hi> character as it appears in the inscriptions on the Chou bronzes. Philologically speaking, the character is the same as <graphic url="NNM122_207b.jpg"/>, is pronounced the same and means "round" or "something round."<ref target="#CH7-n28">28</ref> In the legend the character obviously refers to the shape of the currency as distinguished from the previous currency, the spade. The designation of the round coins as <hi rend="italic">yüan</hi> partially substantiates Pan Ku's statement that the Chou had <hi rend="italic">yüan-fa</hi>,<ref target="#CH7-n29">29</ref> HI <graphic url="NNM122_207c.jpg"/>, "round system" or "round coinage." It serves also to repudiate the much repeated statement that the entire Chou coinage was the <hi rend="italic">yüan-fa.</hi> Since a specimen has

been discovered in Shensi, the territory of the state of Ch'in, Chüng Chia-hsiang suggests that this type of coin was of Ch'in origin.<ref target="#CH7-n30">30</ref> This explanation is plausible, and the coins might have been experimental issues before the Pan-liang.</p>

               <head>3. DATE OF THE ROUND COINAGE</head>
               <p>So far as we know, no numismatist has attempted to date the origin of this special coinage. Practically all numismatists, though, regard the various round coins described above as currency of the last century or centuries of the Chou period. Chüng Chia-hsiang and Ting Fu-pao take exception to this, however, in regard to the round coins of I<ref target="#CH7-n31">31</ref> and "Ming" coins which they hold are of late Ch'in or Han origin.</p>
               <p>Chüng Chia-hsiang believes that these coins were modelled after the imperial Pan-liang coin of Ch'in and were cast at the end of that dynasty.<ref target="#CH7-n32">32</ref> His argument for their late origin is that all have a square central hole which, he says, was a creation of imperial Ch'in (not Ch'in State). Therefore, they must be later than the Pan-liang, the first coinage of the imperial dynasty. He further argues that the size of the "Ming" and I coins is small and that their shape resembles the Ssŭ-chu coin of Emperor Wün of Han (179—157 B. C.).<ref target="#CH7-n33">33</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Ting Fu-pao speaks of the I coins only, and his argument is not based on the square central hole or the size, but on the rims around the hole and the outer circumference. It is his opinion that the rims were a post-Chou design. For this reason, he alleges that the coins of I which have such rims are as late as the reign of Emperor Wu of Han.<ref target="#CH7-n34">34</ref> The reason, as we see it from his writings, is that the name of the city I first appears in an historical record concerning Emperor Wu's reign.<ref target="#CH7-n35">35</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="199"/>
               <p>Those who have read our descriptions of the round coins of the Chou period will detect the faults in their reasoning. Let us take up their arguments one by one and see if they are well founded.</p>
               <p>First, the square central hole. Chüng Chia-hsiang's explanation that the square central hole was a creation of imperial Ch'in contradicts the facts. Both the Chou coin and the "Twelve <hi rend="italic">chu"</hi> coin of the Ch'in state had square central holes (see Groups C and E), and the states of Chou and Ch'in existed before the establishment of the imperial dynasty of Ch'in.</p>
               <p>Second, the size. On this point Chüng Chia-hsiang again goes against the facts. The size of the coins of the Chou period, whether with a round central hole or with a square central hole, varies with the denomination. The average diameter of the largest denomination (six <hi rend="italic">huo)</hi> of the coins of I (with a square central hole) in the collection of The American Numismatic Society is 35 mm. It is almost as large as the Chi-yin coin (with round central hole) of the one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denomination (39 mm.) and larger than the Chi-yin coin of the half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denomination (31 mm.). Although slightly smaller in size, the I coin of the six <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> denomination weighs as much as the Chi-yin coin of one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> (about 10 grams). The one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> coin of Yü with a round central hole has a larger diameter (41 mm.), but it is thinner and weighs less (8.22 grams). In neither size nor weight do we find noticeable difference between the coins with a round central hole (which Chüng Chia-hsiang regards as a distinction of coins of the Chou period) and the coins with a square central hole (which he regards as an imperial Ch'in creation).</p>
               <p>Third, the rims. The argument that rims are of late origin is even less tenable. As far back as the fifth century some Old Spades already had a rim. This was pointed out a century and half ago by Ts'ai Yün in his repudiation of the late origin of the rim.<ref target="#CH7-n36">36</ref> While the round coins of I have rims on their obverses only, these spades have rims on both sides. If the rim theory were at all tenable, the round coins of
<pb n="200"/>
I must have been older than the Old Spades. Furthermore, not all the I coins which Ting Fu-pao regards as of Han origin because of their rims actually have rims. The American Numismatic Society has ten I coins of the one <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> denomination, and five of them have no rims. Rims are not exclusive features of I coins; they also appear on the round coins of Western Chou, Eastern Chou, Lin, Li-shih and some Ch'in (feudatory Ch'in) coins with weight specifications. Ting Fu-pao does not seem to have regarded these coins as of Han origin, and, as a matter of fact, no one can deny that they were coins of the Chou period.</p>
               <p>The assertion that the I coins resemble the shape of a later coin is secondary, and as an argument is too weak to be dealt with. In short, the contention of late origin for the "Ming" and I coins, as advanced by Chüng and Ting, is largely due to their preconceived idea that coins with a square central hole or with rims must be later than the Pan-liang coin of imperial Ch'in. This preconception seems to have prevented their paying attention to facts to the contrary. The truth is that these coins, like the other coins described above, were all coins of the Chou period.</p>
               <p>Pan Ku, a Han historian, states that the round coinage (<hi rend="italic">yüan-fa)</hi> was created by T'ai-kung<ref target="#CH7-n37">37</ref> or Lü Wang as he is called in this paper. This is absolutely impossible. T'ai-kung lived at the beginning of the Chou dynasty. According to the old text of the <hi rend="italic">Bamboo Annals,</hi> he died in the sixth year of King K'ang, which is 1073 B. C. in the traditional chronology. The round coinage, judging from all indications available, was a currency of much later origin. The early date of T'ai-kung and the late origin of the round coin disproves beyond any doubt Pan Ku's statement.</p>
               <p>In his work, <hi rend="italic">Old Tombs of Lo-yang,</hi> W. C. White mentions the recovery of a Tung-Chou (Eastern Chou) coin in one of the tombs at Chin-tsun, Honan,<ref target="#CH7-n38">38</ref> which is dated in the sixth century according
<pb n="201"/>
to him <ref target="#CH7-n39">39</ref> and in the fourth century according to <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n40">40</ref> Upon further inquiry we found that Prof. White relied on a dealer's word for the coin's provenance.<ref target="#CH7-n41">41</ref> Dealers' information on provenance is not always reliable, however.</p>
               <p>As the literary record and the archaeological report are of no avail, we must once again search for indications regarding their origin from the coins themselves.</p>
               <p>In the previous studies on the spade and the knife coinages we have reached the conclusion that the late types of the two coinages lasted well into the third century B. C. As the round coins were a coinage which succeeded the knife and the spade, their date could not have been earlier than this century. In view of the fact that the round coins of the Chou period preserved today are exceedingly few<ref target="#CH7-n42">42</ref> — even fewer than the ancient Hollow-handle Spades — the number cast at that time must have been very small, or the period of their circulation must have been short. Although we cannot say exactly when the round coinage or coinages of Chou began, we are fairly sure of the date it ended. It is a well-known historical fact, related by Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien, that the round coinages of the Chou period were abolished by the first emperor of Ch'in upon his unification of the monetary system in 221 B. C.<ref target="#CH7-n43">43</ref> Since the duration of the round coinages of
<pb n="202"/>
Chou might have been short, we may tentatively date their beginning as around 250 B. C.</p>

               <head>4. SOME HISTORICAL EXPLANATION</head>
               <p>In the above description an interesting historical phenomenon has come to light. It is the continuation of the influence of the coinage of the knife area in the east upon that of the spade area in the west. The expansion of the knife coinage of the ancient Shantung Peninsula, predominantly the state of Ch'i during the Chan-kuo period, and its penetration into the neighboring states of Chao and Yen, has been discussed in Chapter V. As we see them, the reasons the towns and cities of Chao and Yen adopted the eastern knife coinage were largely economic. During the period of the round coinage, the eastern influence seems to have persisted. The evidences are the gradual adoption of the square central hole, and the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> in the western round coinage or coinages. As has been pointed out above, the square central hole was a characteristic feature of the round coin in the old knife area, and <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> was an exclusive monetary designation of the knife and the special monetary unit of the round coin in the area where the knife had been the currency or the dominant currency. In the beginning the characteristics of the round coins in the spade area adjacent to the knife area or in the area into which knife coinage had penetrated<ref target="#CH7-n44">44</ref> were the round central hole and the special monetary unit <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>. Coins with these characteristics were cast
<pb n="203"/>
by the mints of Chou and Ch'in which were in the area where the knife never seems to have been cast; yet among the coins of this group there are preserved some of Chou and Ch'in which have a square central hole (see Groups D and E). Taking all these indications into consideration, we must say that the square central hole of the round coins of the old spade area was an imitation of a feature on the eastern coinage of the old knife area.</p>
               <p>The adoption of eastern monetary features by the west is further demonstrated by the appearance of the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> in the legend of the Chou round coin (see Group C on p. 195). The legend of the coin reads <hi rend="italic">"Chou Huo"</hi> or <hi rend="italic">"Huo</hi> of Chou", the same expression as the legends of the "Ming" coins and the coins of I of the knife area.<ref target="#CH7-n45">45</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The co-existence of two different coinages — in the east the knife and in the west the spade<ref target="#CH7-n46">46</ref> — and the constant influence exerted by the eastern coinage upon that of the west help to explain many of the events which took place in China's early history. Students of Chinese history are familiar with the division of <name type="place">China</name> into the south and the north, and with the economic and political parts played by the two great regions, but this phenomenon did not exist in ancient <name type="place">China</name>. With the Ch'u area in the south less developed culturally and economically, ancient China was constituted of two areas, the east and the west. The center of the west was around the middle of the Yellow River, and the center of the east was on the Shantung Peninsula. The early political history of China was predominantly a struggle between the peoples of the east and west. The Shang people, who originated in the east, conquered and replaced the Hsia people in the west in the first part of the second millennium B. C. A few centuries later the Chou people, who came from the west, conquered and
<pb n="204"/>
replaced the Shang at the end of the twelfth or the eleventh century. The division between the east and west in ancient China and the struggles between the peoples of these two areas have been admirably expounded by Prof. <name type="pname">Fu Ssŭ-nien</name> in his essay "I Hsia tung hsi shuo."<ref target="#CH7-n47">47</ref>The study of ancient Chinese coinages further confirms his analysis and reveals, in addition, that in economic life the east seems to have always maintained the leading role.</p>
               <p>The construction of Lo-i in present central northern Honan as the "eastern capital" of Chou has been stated and believed to be a pure political and military measure to control the vanquished Shang. The action, however, may have also been motivated by the desire to approximate the wealth of the east. The economic intentions are clearly manifested in the actions of Chao and Liang in moving their capitals to <name type="pname">Han-tan</name> and <name type="pname">Ta-liang</name>, both on the "Cross-road" to the approaches to eastern resources. Both the Ch'in and Han dynasties relied on the east for much of their supplies, and the city of <name type="pname">Lin-tzŭ</name> in the east about 127 B. C. seems to have been the only city which had a "prosperous and rich" population of 100,000 households, yielded a market tax of 1,000 (Han catties of) gold, and was "greater than Ch'ang-an,"<ref target="#CH7-n48">48</ref> the imperial capital of Han.</p>
               <p>All indications point to the fact that the east of ancient China had greater economic resources than the west, and for that reason exerted much influence over the latter. With this fact in mind, we can easily understand why the coinage, of the east was imitated in the west and not vice versa.</p>
               <p>Was the eastern or the knife area the first to adopt the round shape in coinage ? This seems to be a logical hypothesis in view of what has been said above, but that part of the spade area which had adopted the knife as one of its currencies under the strong influence of the east used the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> of the spade, not the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of the knife for the monetary unit of its round coins. Therefore the west appears to be the first area to introduce round coinage. However, these are pure conjeetures.
<pb n="205"/>
Any answer of this question, as well as many other questions regarding the coinages of Chinese antiquity, will have to depend upon future archaeological investigations.</p>
               <p>Several general assumptions have been made regarding the origin of the shape. One suggestion has it that the shape was derived from the ring at the end of the handle of the knife coin, while another contends that it was an imitation of the <hi rend="italic">pi</hi> or jade disc, which was a religious object symbolizing Heaven. Whereas we do not think that it is profitable to dwell on pure conjectures, we deem it necessary to point out the fact that at the time when the round coin was about to appear the ring of the handle of the knife coins had degenerated to such an extent that it had become very small and in some cases had actually disappeared. In our opinion, there is no reason to believe that the round coin was modelled after the ring in the handle of the knife coins.</p>

            <head>VIII. MONETARY DESIGNATIONS AND MONETARY UNITS</head>
            <p>Inasmuch as monetary units and designations are essential features of the coinages of ancient <name type="place">China</name>, they have already been mentioned in connection with the discussion of the various coinages. It remains to investigate their origin and development as monetary units, and the changes in their weights and denominational systems in the course of many centuries. As the <name type="pname">
                  <hi rend="italic">yüan</hi>
               </name>, the monetary designation and unit of the money of the state of Ch'u, has been discussed fully in the section on the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi>, we will here treat only the <hi rend="italic">lieh,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Hang</hi>.</p>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e17483" type="section">
               <head>1. THE LIEH</head>
               <p>The origin of the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_216a.jpg"/> is uncertain.<ref target="#CH8-n1">1</ref> In the legends on spade coins and in the inscriptions of the Chou bronzes the character is written <graphic url="NNM122_216b.jpg"/>. It appears to be an ideograph signifying a hand holding something which another hand approachs to take. The hand may be holding a single object, as <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> understands it,.<ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref> or the character may be the symbol for a handful of objects, as we are inclined to think. The ideograph implies the transfer of the objects from one hand to another, or from one person to another. In other
<pb n="207"/>
words, it seems to denote a transaction, such as an exchange of commodities. The handful may be of grain, for grain, being the essential food of the ancient Chinese, is likely to have been the first commodity used in a specific quantity to represent a certain value in measuring the values of other commodities. Traditions strongly maintain that the ancient Chinese used the <hi rend="italic">shu</hi> (millet), seeds in certain numbers to define the smallest units in their measures of weight, length and capacity. It is possible that at a later date, when exchange of commodities increased both in frequency and in kind, the handful of grain no longer constituted a convenient medium of exchange. As the quantity necessary to express a certain value for any object is best determined by weight, the original value-unit may have developed into a weight-unit. But as the value of different objects varies with their availability and the amount of labor spent in their production, the <hi rend="italic">lieh,</hi> as a weight-unit derived from a value-unit, must vary too. As a result there must have been <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> of different weights, as was still true during the Han dynasty.</p>
               <p>It is needless to say that this interpretation of the origin of the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> is purely conjectural. Whatever its origin, the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> as a weight unit must have had a long history. To say the least, as evidence shows, it must have been in existence during the Shang dynasty. In the inscription of the <name type="pname">Shih-lu</name> Tripod, <name type="pname">Shih-lu</name> was fined three hundred "old" <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> of an object the name of which cannot be deciphered <ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> dates this inscription to King <name type="pname">Ch'üng's</name> reign <ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref> Since Ch'üng became king in 1115 B. C., only seven years after Shang was conquered by his father, the actual founder of the Chou dynasty, the "old" <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>, as <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> has rightly suggested, must have been the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> of the Shang period <ref target="#CH8-n5">5</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In bronze inscriptions of the early part of the Chou period <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> is found to be a weight unit to measure objects of a pecuniary nature such as cowrie shells and <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_217a.jpg"/> The character <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> which in ancient times generally meant "metal" may here refer to copper, as
<pb n="208"/>
                  <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> understands it,.<ref target="#CH8-n6">6</ref> and may refer to a money in metal form. As a designation of metallic money, <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> is found in the literature of the Chou period and in the legends on the Special Old Spades of <name type="pname">Liang</name> (see p. 138). If it here means metallic money, then the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> in terms of which money is measured must have been a monetary unit; in other words, the weight unit <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> must have been adopted as a weight standard in minting. This, however, is more hypothetical than certain.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> as a weight unit for measuring metallic money occurs with certainty in Chou bronze inscriptions dated from the time of King <name type="pname">Mu</name> (1001 — 947 B. C.) down, where it is used in conjunction with the character<graphic url="NNM122_218a.jpg"/>. All in all, seven inscriptions have been preserved in which the two characters occur together, the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> evidently serving as a measure for a certain amount of the other article. In one of them there is recorded a proposal to purchase five "slaves" with one hundred <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> of the article<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The other six are all concerned with appointment to high ranking offices. In them the appointee is always commanded by the king "to take (or to receive)" so many <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> of the article in remuneration <ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref> The numbers range from five to thirty. The name of the object is very difficult to decipher. Although no less than six different suggestions have been made,.<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> none of them can be regarded as satisfactory. Judging from the contexts of these inscriptions, the object can be nothing but a kind of money. This is also the interpretation of <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> and <name type="pname">Wu K'ai-shüng</name>
                  <ref target="#CH8-n9">9</ref> (It is most unfortunate that we do not know the reading of the name of the money, for if we did, we certainly would be better informed of the monetary system of the time.) Since <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> is used to measure
<pb n="209"/>
the money, it must be either a monetary unit or a weight unit applied to this coinage.</p>
               <p>As a monetary unit for coinage <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> is also found in the legends of the Special Old Spades of Liang which have been described (pp. 13off). As pointed out above, when the type of spade reckoned in terms of <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> was in circulation, there must have been another coinage whose weight was based on the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>, for we have such expressions as "equal to one <hi rend="italic">lieh"</hi> and "equal to twelve <hi rend="italic">lieh"</hi> We do not know exactly to what kind of money the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> of these expressions referred. Since at the time of the Old Spades of <name type="pname">Liang</name> there were three types of coin in circulation — the knife, the spade and the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> — <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> as a monetary unit must have applied to one of these. We know that <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yüan</hi> applied to the knife and the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> respectively. Possibly the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> was used as a unit for the spade alongside the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> or in certain areas instead of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>. This hypothesis is plausible in view of the fact that the use of <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> did not come with the beginning of spade coinage, but many centuries later, when the coinage had developed to its latest stage of hollow handles. The original unit for the spade may well have been the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> preceding the adoption of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>. It is assumed that adoption of <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> was slow and gradual, and that <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> came to be adopted in some areas, while other areas continued to reckon their spades in <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>. Such a circumstance would explain why the state of <name type="pname">Liang</name> specified on its own spades (based on the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>) their exchange rate with spades of other mints which were based on the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>. Again, it is not impossible that the monetary appellation recorded on the bronzes discussed above was the official name for the spade whose value was measured by the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>. Then, for some reason or other, this official name came into disuse and was replaced by the popular terms <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">po</hi> (<hi rend="italic">pu</hi>).</p>
               <p>There are no contemporary records which supply information on the exact weight of the <hi rend="italic">lieh.</hi> What literary evidence we have is all of Han date, which may or may not represent the situation of the Chou period. According to our information, three different <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> are known: one equal to 11 13/25 <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> (which is about a half <hi rend="italic">liang</hi>); the second
<pb n="210"/>
equal to 6 2/3 <hi rend="italic">liang;</hi> and the third equal to 6 <hi rend="italic">liang.</hi>.<ref target="#CH8-n10">10</ref> The second and third are so close that they may be considered two versions of the same standard measure. So we may consider that there were two kinds of <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> of entirely different weight. The discrepancy between them is so great that <name type="pname">Kuo Mo-jo</name> was led to believe that the heavier <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> represented the "old" <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> of <name type="pname">Shang</name>
                  <ref target="#CH8-n11">11</ref> On another occasion, he expressed an opinion that it constituted the weight measure for commodities, while the lighter <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> was the weight unit for money <ref target="#CH8-n12">12</ref>
               </p>
               <p>How heavy was the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> as a monetary unit ? On this question the Special Old Spades of <name type="pname">Liang</name> may provide us some information, for each of these spades bears an equation between its denomination in terms of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> and its denomination in terms of the <hi rend="italic">lieh.</hi> Both the spade with legend a) and the spade with legend c) equated to one <hi rend="italic">lieh,</hi> and the spade with legend d) is specified as equal to twelve <hi rend="italic">lieh.</hi> The weights of Type a), the "standard" spades of Liang with 1 <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> equal to 1 <hi rend="italic">lieh,</hi> in the Museum of the American Numismatic Society are as follows: 10.85, 11.52, 12.55, 12.05, 16.00, 13.15,13.40, 14.91,13.72 grams.</p>
               <p>Here we see that so far as Type a) of the Special Old Spades of <name type="pname">Liang</name> are concerned, the weight of the <hi rend="italic">lieh,</hi> as equal to the <hi rend="italic">chin,</hi> is 16 grams in the heaviest specimen. This weight cannot be regarded as the original weight of the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> as the weight of no coin which has been buried underground for two thousand years and more, and subjected to oxidization, would be precisely the original.</p>
               <p>The official ratio between the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> may have been artificial because of reasons unknown to us. But even if it were so and there were some difference between the weight of the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">chin,</hi> the difference could not have been too large, for any compulsory equation of two monetary units of greatly different weight would defeat the very purpose for which the equation was made — that is, to facilitate the trade between the areas where these two different units were used.</p>
               <pb n="211"/>
               <p>Both Type c) and Type d) of the Special Old Spades of Liang which are specified "to be used as" are believed to have been "token" money. Compared to Type c) the reduction in weight of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> and, for that matter the <hi rend="italic">lieh,</hi> of Type d) is more striking. The weights of seven pieces of this type are as follows: 26.18 28.02, 17.40, 19.50, 25.10, 23.54 25.05 grams.</p>

               <p>The character <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_221a.jpg"/> in modern script) which appears in the legends of spades of various types has often been interpreted by numismatists as representing two characters <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>, <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_221b.jpg"/> (i. e., metal money) or <hi rend="italic">chin chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_221c.jpg"/> (i. e., one catty of metal). The separation of the character into two parts is wholly unwarranted, and the suggested readings are untenable <ref target="#CH8-n13">13</ref> A recent suggestion to read it as <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_221d.jpg"/> is equally ill-founded <ref target="#CH8-n14">14</ref> The reading of the character as <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> was first advanced by <name type="pname">Liu Shih-lu</name>,.<ref target="#CH8-n15">15</ref> and is generally accepted today. But the interpretation of its meaning varies with different numismatists. The reason for varying interpretation is that the character does not occur in the literature of the Chou period except for the <hi rend="italic">Chuang-tzŭ</hi>, where it is used to signify an implement having no relation to money <ref target="#CH8-n16">16</ref> Hsü Shün (first century A. D.), the first scholar to comment on the character, renders its meaning as <hi rend="italic">chi-tuan</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_221e.jpg"/> that is "To cut or sever evenly or regularly,".<ref target="#CH8-n17">17</ref> an
<pb n="212"/>
explanation which also fails to show any connection between the character and the spade money. Believing Hsü Shü's opinion too authoritative to cast aside, numismatists could only fabricate an interpretation for the character by emphasizing one of the ideas implied in his comments, or distort his words. <name type="pname">Liu Shih-lu's</name> interpretation of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> as a monetary designation for the spade is based on the hypothesis that the coins were cast in pairs and had to be severed after they were taken out of the molds <ref target="#CH8-n18">18</ref> This agrees with Hsü Shü's explanation of <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> as "to sever." The character <hi rend="italic">chi,</hi> in Hsü Shün's comment on <hi rend="italic">chi-tuan,</hi> led <name type="pname">Wang Lien-shüng</name> to the conclusion that <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> means "tally.".<ref target="#CH8-n19">19</ref> Chüng Chia-hsiang further stretches the meaning of the character <hi rend="italic">chi</hi> in the sense of "tally" to signify a "medium" for "equalizing or standardizing market prices," and thus infers that this word refers to money. He asserts that this is the reason that its equivalent <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> became the designation for a kind of money, that is, the spade <ref target="#CH8-n20">20</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The interpretations are too elaborate and distorted to be convincing. In the following we shall attempt an explanation which, we hope, may be more natural and logical. In the absence of any historical data relevant to the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> as a monetary unit, we shall base our interpretation on the structure of the character.</p>
               <p>The basic component part of our character <graphic url="NNM122_222a.jpg"/> is <graphic url="NNM122_222b.jpg"/>, pronounced also <hi rend="italic">chin.</hi> There is no doubt whatsoever that etymologically the former developed from the latter. Though ever since the time of imperial Ch'in (221—207 B-C.) <graphic url="NNM122_222c.jpg"/> is generally used as the term for a measure of weight equal to sixteen <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> (Chinese ounces), this usage seems to have been lacking in the Chou period <ref target="#CH8-n21">21</ref> Originally the
<pb n="213"/>
character meant "ax," or, to use Hsü Shün's words, "the ax for cutting wood.".<ref target="#CH8-n22">22</ref> It is our belief that the character <graphic url="NNM122_223a.jpg"/>, which is derived from <graphic url="NNM122_223b.jpg"/> denoting ax, may have been used at the beginning to denote the same implement.</p>
               <p>Our assumption is supported by evidence from the texts of the <name type="pname">
                     <hi rend="italic">Kuan-tzŭ</hi>
                  </name> and the <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="pname">Chuang-tzŭ.</name>
                  </hi>.<ref target="#CH8-n23">23</ref> The two passages are analogous in structure and meaning. In the <name type="pname">
                     <hi rend="italic">Kuan-tzŭ</hi>
                  </name> it is said that the carpenter needs to have a <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_223c.jpg"/> and a <hi rend="italic">chü</hi> (saw). The similar sentence in the <hi rend="italic">Chuang-tzŭ</hi> gives the tools of the carpenter as <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_223d.jpg"/> and chü <ref target="#CH8-n24">24</ref> Thus the character <graphic url="NNM122_223e.jpg"/> is used to the exclusion of <graphic url="NNM122_223f.jpg"/> in one text, and vice versa in the other. According to Lu Tü-ming (d. ca. 630), in an early copy of the <hi rend="italic">Chuang-tzŭ</hi> not accessible to us, the character <graphic url="NNM122_223g.jpg"/> was replaced by the character <graphic url="NNM122_223h.jpg"/>
                  <ref target="#CH8-n25">25</ref> This is indisputable evidence of the interchangeability of the two characters. Hence Chu Ch'i-füng has good reason to maintain that <graphic url="NNM122_223i.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM122_223j.jpg"/> are but the simple and the complex form of the same character, possessing the same pro-nounciation and consequently the same meaning <ref target="#CH8-n26">26</ref> They both refer to the same tool, the ax. The comment of Hsü Shün, that <graphic url="NNM122_223k.jpg"/> is the equivalent of "to cut or sever evenly or regularly," simply refers to the action of the tool.</p>
               <p>How did it happen then that the name of the ax came to be used as a monetary unit? The only possible explanation is that at the time when the ax first came to be used as a monetary unit, one spade coin could buy one ax. Since the ax was a universal tool, indispensable to every household in ancient <name type="place">China</name> where the forests were far more extensive than today, the most obvious reason is, that it was employed as an article to measure the exchange value of a spade coin of a certain weight. For some unexplained reason only the people in the spade area used this device.</p>
               <p>Since it was an exclusive monetary unit of the spade coin, the spade coin could of course be so designated. Thus instead of saying
<pb n="214"/>
how many spades of certain <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denominations, the people might say how many <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> of the spade, or simply how many <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>. In the literature of the late Chou period, such as the <hi rend="italic">Chan-kuo ts'ü</hi> and other contemporary works, we frequently meet with the monetary expressions of "so many <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>" <graphic url="NNM122_224a.jpg"/> and <hi rend="italic">"chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_224b.jpg"/> of so many <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_224c.jpg"/>". The character <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_224d.jpg"/> in both expressions is not to be understood as meaning "metal" or "gold" as generally it has been; it means a money or a specific money, as it is used in the legends of the Special Old Spades of <name type="pname">Liang</name>. The character <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_224e.jpg"/> is used as a monetary unit, and not to be confused with the weight measure <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> of post-Chou origin (usually rendered as "catty"); it is the abbreviated form of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_224f.jpg"/> under discussion. Thus the two expressions should be understood as meaning "so many of the money" and "the money of so many <hi rend="italic">chin"</hi> The "money" is the spade <ref target="#CH8-n27">27</ref> In the first expression the monetary unit is omitted. "So many the money" actually means "so many money units," the unit of course being the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>.</p>
               <p>Though eventually it appears to have become the universal monetary unit of the spade coinage and the round coinage in the spade area, the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> seems not to have been the original monetary unit of the spade. The original monetary unit or weight unit of the spade was probably the <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi>. The first appearance of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> as the monetary unit of the spade is in the legends of the Hollow-handle Spades of Mi (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 2) and of "<name type="pname">San-ch'uan</name>" (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 2). According to our proposed chronology of the spade coinage, these Hollow-handle Spades, being late in shape and design, were the last types of the Hollow-handle Spade as a whole and were in circulation in the seventh and sixth centuries B. C. The adoption of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> as a monetary unit for the spade may not have been much earlier than this date.</p>
               <p>The date of the seventh and sixth centuries is significant. The Hollow-handle Spade which is designated as the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> or is specified as of one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> (ax) denomination is small and light, weighing, as in the case of a specimen in the Museum of the American Numismatic Society, no more than 37.3 grams. But the actual ax must
<pb n="215"/>
be much heavier and larger in order to be practical for cutting purposes. Therefore, the actual tool and the coin equivalent to the value of one ax must have been manufactured of different metals. Since the coin is of bronze, the tool no doubt must have been made of iron. Although the beginning of the use of iron in <name type="place">China</name> is still being debated, we gather from literary sources that the metal was common by the middle of the seventh century B. C <ref target="#CH8-n28">28</ref> The <name type="pname">
                     <hi rend="italic">Kuantzŭ</hi>
                  </name> records that in Kuan Chung's time (d. 645 B. C.) iron was used for making needles and knives for women, ploughshares and weeding spades for farmers, and axes and saws for the Cartwright <ref target="#CH8-n29">29</ref> The use of iron tools is also confirmed by a passage in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="pname">Kuo yü</name>
                  </hi> which credits Kuan Chung with saying that the <hi rend="italic">wo-chin</hi> (bad metal) is to serve for making farming tools <ref target="#CH8-n30">30</ref> The so-called "bad metal" (or "inferior metal") must be iron. At the time of Mencius iron tools were so general that he speaks of farm implements of iron as a matter of course <ref target="#CH8-n31">31</ref> It is very possible that the popularity of iron implements was such that the value of the currency was expressed in terms of a particular variety, no doubt the most widely used, of these tools.</p>
               <p>The denominational system of the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> varied with different types of the spades. The Hollow-handle Spades were of only one size, and, therefore, one denomination, one <hi rend="italic">chin.</hi> With the appearance of the Old Spades its denominations were multiplied. Besides the one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denomination, there were the two and the half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denominations. The Late Spades, except those of the state of Ch'in which had a different monetary unit, had only two sizes and consequently two denominations, the one and the half. All these have been described previously. We have mentioned, too, that not all of the spades have in their legends the name of the monetary unit and its denominations. The omission from the legend of the name of the monetary unit and its denomination, or of the name 
<pb n="216"/>
of the monetary unit alone, is found in cases in which the omission would not cause confusion. Otherwise not only the name of the monetary unit but also the denomination is specified. The time of the Old Spade was still close to the beginning of the adoption of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> as the monetary unit. The system was still new. Therefore, in the legend of every one of the spades preserved today both the monetary unit and its denomination are carefully designated. But the situation with the Late Spade was different. By the time this type of spade appeared, many years had passed. The monetary unit had become customary, and for this reason it could be omitted from the legend and it usually was. Because the Late Spades were of only two denominations differing markedly in size, the specification of their denomination was rendered equally unnecessary, though the denomination of many half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> spades was still designated.</p>
               <p>The weighing of various specimens in the museum of the American Numismatic Society yielded some interesting points which are demonstrated in the on page 217.</p>
               <p>The table shows, first, the weight of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> in any one period is roughly the same, irrespective of the mint. Secondly, the weight of a spade corresponds to its denomination. Thirdly, in the course of about three hundred years the weight of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> became gradually but consistently reduced from 37.3 grams to about 10.</p>
               <p>However, a word needs to be said about the spades of Kuo. According to their shape and design these belong to the Late Spade type. Yet in weight they are heavier than the Late Spades from other mints. The half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> spade of Kuo weighs as much as the one <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> spade from other mints, and even equals in weight some of the Old Spades which bear the same denomination. We do not know the economic and political reasons for this difference in weight. However, one thing to be noted about these specimens is the superior quality of the alloy. The spades of Kuo listed in the chart show no sign of oxidization or patination. Their color is dark brown and their condition excellent. If their greater weight is due to this reason alone, it might be closer to the norm of the half <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> denomination.</p>

               <head>3. THE HUO</head>
               <p>The primary meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_228a.jpg"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">hua</hi> in modern script and pronunciation), the monetary designation of the knife, is "to change." From its primary meaning it appears to have derived one of its secondary meanings, "to exchange in trade," as it is used in the often quoted line from the <hi rend="italic">Shang-shu, mao-ch'ien yu-wu huo ku,</hi> "to exchange and transfer surplus and want through trade.".<ref target="#CH8-n32">32</ref> Since money is the object which consummates exchange in trade, there is every reason to believe that <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> as a monetary designation and later as a monetary unit must have come from the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> as a descriptive word for the action "to trade." In other words, <hi rend="italic">huo,</hi> originally meaning "to exchange in trade," gradually became the name of the medium with which trade was consummated.</p>
               <p>Though it had been used in the legends of the first knife coins of Chi-mo and Ch'i, <graphic url="NNM122_228b.jpg"/> is not the original form of the character; its original form is <graphic url="NNM122_228c.jpg"/>
                  <ref target="#CH8-n33">33</ref> In ancient Chinese script, characters often could be reversed without affecting the meaning. Therefore, <graphic url="NNM122_228d.jpg"/> can be reversed as. This latter form appears in the legends of "Ming" and "One <hi rend="italic">Huo</hi>" round coins as their monetary unit.</p>
               <p>Judging from the inscriptions or legends of the knife coins of all types, <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> seemed to have been merely the monetary designation of the knife when and where it was in circulation. It is possible that, being the monetary designation of a particular currency, <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> might have been also used as the monetary unit. As a definite monetary unit, <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> came into being only when the round coinage made its appearance in the original knife area and the other areas where the knife had also become a currency. Thus in the coinage of I there are the one, the two, the four and six denominations based on the <hi rend="italic">huo.</hi> The denominational system of the round coins of other mints in both
<pb n="219"/>
the old and new knife areas, being also multiple, might have been the same as that of I.</p>
               <p>To find the weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> as a monetary unit and the relations between the various denominations, a few specimens preserved in good condition were selected from the collection of the American Numismatic Society and weighed. The results are in the following table:</p>

               </table>
               <p>An analysis of the facts shown in the table reveals several interesting points:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1.">The weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> varies with the type of coins. Within the same type the weight is found to vary with design.</item>
                  <pb n="220"/>
                  <item n="2.">As shown by "Ming" coins and the coins of I, the weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of the coins without rims is heavier than those with rims. Since we can reasonably assume that coins without rims are earlier than those with rims, the weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> at the beginning of the round coinage in the knife area seems heavier than that of the later issues. The size of the earlier issues is also larger.</item>
                  <item n="3.">In the case of the rimmed coins of I the increase in denomination corresponds roughly to the increase in weight.</item>
                  <item n="4.">The specimen of the two<hi rend="italic">-huo</hi> denomination of I (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate IV</hi>, 2) stands out as an exception; its weight is almost as great as that of the four <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> specimens of the same mint. This specimen, dark red in color (without patina, and in excellent condition of preservation) appears to have been subjected to much less or no oxidization. Its weight (5. 52) may well approximate the original. If this is the case, as we believe it is, the original weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> when the rimmed coins of I were cast was at least 2.76 grams.</item>
                  <item n="5.">The weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of this two <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> coin of I is roughly the same as the weight of three rimmed "One <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>" coins (2.60, 2.57, 2.47) which are also preserved in excellent condition. This further confirms the approximation of the weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of the two <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> coin of I to the original weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of the time.</item>
                  <item n="6.">The weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> as 2.76 grams or slightly more derived from the weight of the two <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> coin of I is very close to that of the rimless one <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> coins of the same mint (2.35 and 2.15). But since these specimens are badly oxidized, their original weight must have been larger. From this we may infer that at an earlier date when I issued the rimless coins the weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> of the coinage of I must have been more than 2.76 grams, which weight is derived from its two <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> coin with rims — a design which was later in origin. In view of this the weight of the one <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> denomination of "Ming" coins may well represent the original weight of the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> at the beginning of the round coinage in the knife area, for these coins are rimless and are most likely of early date.</item>
                  <item n="7.">Granting possible regional discrepancies, the weight of the
<pb n="221"/>
monetary unit <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> in the days of the round coinage appears to have been roughly the same. The rapid reduction in its weight shown in the table is certainly a reflection of the chaotic economic and political condition in the last years of the Chou period, when war was the order of the day and the local powers which cast the coins were on the verge of extinction.</item>

Therefore, in Chinese antiquity, two units of any thing which together were considered as one larger unit was called <hi rend="italic">liang.</hi> Thus, two rolls of silk fabric was called one liawg of silk. Two "Fives" <hi rend="italic">(wu)</hi> of soldiers made a military unit which was also called <hi rend="italic">liang.</hi> Because the carriage and wagon each had two wheels, the unit in counting carriages and wagons was also <hi rend="italic">liang.</hi> It is only natural, then, to assume that the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> as a weight or monetary unit must be a larger unit based on two smaller ones.</p>
               <p>In ancient times the Chinese, like many other peoples, used seeds of grain to measure weight. The grain which the Chinese used was <hi rend="italic">shu</hi> (millet). One <hi rend="italic">yüeh</hi>, a standard musical tube, contained 1,200 such seeds, which weighed twelve <hi rend="italic">chu</hi>,.<ref target="#CH8-n34">34</ref> written <graphic url="NNM122_231b.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NNM122_231c.jpg"/> in the legends of the spades and round coins of the feudatory of Ch'in. "Twelve <hi rend="italic">chu</hi>" was the smaller of the two denominations of the spade coinage of Ch'in instituted by, as we believe, King <name type="pname">Hui-wün</name> in 336 B. C. The larger denomination was one <hi rend="italic">liang</hi>, which is the denominational specification appearing on the reverse of all of the Ch'in spades of the larger size. As we know that at the time one <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> was composed of twenty-four <hi rend="italic">chu</hi>, the denomination of the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> was made up of two "twelve <hi rend="italic">chu</hi>" units. The larger spade weighed twice as much as the smaller, and in denomination it should literally have been called "two twel<hi rend="italic">ve-chu.</hi> "But "two twel<hi rend="italic">ve-chu"</hi> cannot be regarded as a convenient terminology. Therefore, following
<pb n="222"/>
the customary practice, the unit of double twelve <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> was designated as <hi rend="italic">liang</hi>. It is our belief that the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> as a weight unit weighing twenty-four <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> must have come from the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> as a monetary unit composed of two "twelve <hi rend="italic">chu.".<ref target="#CH8-n35">35</ref>

               <p>Only a very limited number of the Ch'in (as a feudatory) coins have been reported. With the exception of Lacouperie, the numismatists who report them do not give their weight. The Museum of the American Numismatic Society has in its collection two Ch'in spades and two Ch'in round coins. Their weights and other particulars are as follows:</p>

               <p>Lacouperie reports a round coin of 1 <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> and 14 <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> denomination, as weighing 171 grains.<ref target="#CH8-n36">36</ref> or 11.08 grams.</p>
               <p>A glance at the above table shows the common phenomenon of reduction in weight in the coinage of Ch'in. In spite of its power and prestige at the end of the Chou period, its round coins, although of a denomination triple that of the two listed spades, about equal them in weight. Thus the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> in the days of the round coinage was in weight only a third of what it was in the days of the Late Spade.</p>
               <p>The literary sources of the Chou period contain no information whatsoever concerning the condition of the public finances of the contending states during the later part of Chou. The coinages constitute the only source of information on this question. Financially, wars had benefited neither the aggressor nor the attacked. They depleted the treasuries and caused inflation and reduction in weight in the coinages of both the victor (Ch'in) and the vanquished (Ch'i Yen, Han, Chao, Liang).</p>
               <p>Regarding this point it is worthwhile to mention that after conquering the whole of ancient <name type="place">China</name> and establishing himself as the sole ruler of <name type="place">China</name> in 221 B. C., the First Emperor <hi rend="italic">(Shih-huang-ti)</hi> of Ch'in immediately put his coinage on a sound basis and cast the Pan-liang (i. e., twelve <hi rend="italic">chu</hi>) coin and ordered its weight to correspond to its denomination <ref target="#CH8-n37">37</ref> Many Pan-liang coins are preserved today; their average weight is about 10 grams, the same weight as the "twelve <hi rend="italic">chu</hi>" (i. e., pan<hi rend="italic">-liang</hi> or <hi rend="italic">half-liang</hi>) of the state coinage of Ch'in when this was established in the fourth century B. C.</p>

                  <p>In his historical account of the origin of <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> as a measure of weight, Pan Ku, author of the <hi rend="italic">Han shu</hi>, states that "one <hi rend="italic">yüeh</hi> contained 1200 <hi rend="italic">shu</hi> (seeds), weighing twelve <hi rend="italic">chu.</hi> By doubling this the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> was made." He states this as a matter of fact and does not point out the reason why the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> was made by doubling the weight of "twelve <hi rend="italic">chu."</hi> Why not triple it? The investigation of the spade coinage of Ch'in and its denominational system offered us the first opportunity to discover the origin of the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> as a weight unit. It grew out of the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> as a monetary unit. In this connection it is interesting to note that the early sub-unit of the <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> (i.e., the <hi rend="italic">chu)</hi> was later also changed because of another monetary reason. The new sub-unit which replaced the old <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM122_231d.jpg"/> (literarily coin) which remains in use today. The substitution of <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> for <hi rend="italic">chu</hi> took place in the seventh century A. D. when ten <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> (coins) used at the time weighed exactly one <hi rend="italic">liang.</hi> Thereafter one <hi rend="italic">liang</hi> was always equated with ten <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi>, and the equation of "twenty-four <hi rend="italic">chu"</hi> was abandoned. Hence today everyone knows "ten <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> make up one <hi rend="italic">liang"</hi> But the origin of the expression has been completely forgotten and known only to numismatists. Ts'ai Yün is the one who should be given the credit for the discovery <hi rend="italic">(P'i-t'an,</hi> I, 9b). Developed out of a monetary unit also is probably the weight unit <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> (catty), with the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> of the spade being its origin. A discussion of this question will involve much space and must be postponed to another occasion.</p>

            <head>IX. THE RIGHT OF COINAGE IN CHINESE ANTIQUITY</head>
            <p>Because our knowledge of the political and economic institutions of the <name type="place">Shang</name> period is so fragmentary we have no evidence, either direct or indirect, on coinage rights before the Chou period. A similar lack of information exists for some of the states known to have cast coins in the Chou period, namely <name type="pname">Chi-mo</name>, <name type="pname">An-yang</name> and <name type="pname">T'an</name>, which were outside the Chou kingdom until the latter part of the seventh century.</p>
            <p>Direct information on coinage rights in the Chou kingdom itself is scanty. A passage in the <name type="pname">
                  <hi rend="italic">Kuo yü</hi>
               </name> states that in 524 B. C. King Ching of Chou cast "big coins." The Chou royalty, as would be expected, possessed the right to cast coins, but whether the princes below the king, the nobility below the princes, the heads of tributary states subject to Chou, and the common people at the bottom of the social hierarchy, had the same right, we do not know. It is true that a passage in the <hi rend="italic">Shih-chi</hi> records that King <name type="pname">Chuang</name> (613—591 B. C.) of Ch'u cast "big" coins to replace "the small" ones which fact indicates that the head of a vassal state had the right of coinage. It is not certain, however, that the record is reliable. Even if it is reliable, we are still not certain how far we can generalize in this case because Ch'u, being an old state subject to Chou, was different from the feudatories which were created anew by Chou. In the absence of direct and reliable information, we shall have to investigate the problem of the right of coinage in general from indirect sources.</p>
            <p>As it can be assumed, the right of coinage in Chou <name type="place">China</name> was bound up with the feudalism which, in our opinion, was the prevailing feature of the political organization of the period. The question is to what extent were power and privileges granted to the princes and the lesser nobility under the Chinese form of enfeudation, and to
<pb n="225"/>
what extent was autonomy permitted to the subject states. Here it is not necessary to enter into detailed discussion of the structure of the political feudalism in ancient <name type="place">China</name>, to refute incorrect explanations or to defend our own interpretations. For the present purpose, a general description will suffice.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the Chou period, the Chou kingdom was made up of the royal domain, the principalities which were fiefs of royal relatives and meritorious ministers, and the tributary states which had submitted to the Chou after it conquered the Shang.<ref target="#CH9-n1">1</ref> The case of the tributary states being comparatively simple, let us first look at the powers and privileges of their princes. By bestowing land upon them, the king made them virtually owners of the land and of the people within its boundaries, as he was owner of the kingdom through grant from Heaven. The princes apparently had full power of disposition over both the land and the people. They could parcel out their land and grant it to their relatives and subordinates as fiefs with only a
<pb n="226"/>
nominal sanction by the king. They exacted labor service and subjected their people to various demands. They kept a standing army commensurate with the size of their fief, and possessed complete authority in judicial administration. If the words of <name type="pname">Kuan Chung</name> are to believed, a large feudatory, such as Ch'i appears to have been granted the power to launch military campaigns against feudatories and tributary states should the latter disobey the wishes of the king or fail to fulfill their obligations.<ref target="#CH9-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the king, the princes were obliged only to pay periodical visits to the royal court, offer annual tribute, and render military assistance in case of war. At the beginning of the dynasty the king seems to have set up some sort of inspectorate known as <hi rend="italic">chien</hi> in certain of the feudatories in order to watch over the conduct of the princes, but these particular princes were all descendants of the conquered <name type="place">Shang</name> and therefore were exceptions. The general supervision which the king imposed upon the princes through royal appointment or sanction of their officials of the "ministerial rank" <hi rend="italic">(ch'ing</hi>) gradually lost its significance and became a mere formality by the end of the eighth century.<ref target="#CH9-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of course, not all the feudatories were of the same magnitude and status. The princes under Chou are said to have been grouped according
<pb n="227"/>
to the "Five Ranks" and their states given status accordingly, a system which may not have functioned as systematically as later historians would have us believe,<ref target="#CH9-n4">4</ref> but it appears certain that gradations in the status of feudatories did exist. Three classes of princes are mentioned in bronze inscriptions,<ref target="#CH9-n5">5</ref> and also in the chapter "<name type="pname">K'ang kao</name>" of the <name type="pname">
                  <hi rend="italic">Shang-shu</hi>
               </name>.<ref target="#CH9-n6">6</ref> However, no matter whether their territory was large or small, whether their rank was high or low, the princes were all granted the same basic privileges, which, though varying in degree, were essentially identical.<ref target="#CH9-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>As to the tributary states, of which the most famous ones were Hsü, Ch'u and Wu, their relationship to the king of Chou was more loose. The <hi rend="italic">chien</hi> inspectorate system is not known to have extended to them. Nor did the king appoint their high ministers. As a matter of fact, the rulers of these tributary states also entitled themselves <hi rend="italic">wang</hi> (king), the same title used by the Chou sovereign. It appears that, at least in name, the sovereign of Chou and the rulers of tributary states were all heads of states; they were all "kings."<ref target="#CH9-n8">8</ref> Inasmuch as their relationship to the Chou king was loose, their obligation to him must have been smaller, and consequently their autonomous power must have been greater.</p>
            <p>What has been said about the prince in relation to the king may, in a minor degree, hold true of the relations between the prince and the
<pb n="228"/>
lesser nobility whom he enfeoffed. These lesser nobles in the principalities were the prince's governmental functionaries. In return for their services the leading officials were granted fiefs consisting of sizable areas of land including one or more cities or towns. The inferior ones were given smaller fiefs in terms of a number of <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which was a local administrative unit. These fief holders in turn delegated their authority to their underlings who had the same obligations to them as the fief holders had to their patron, the prince. They may reasonably be assumed to have been entitled to privileges similar to those of the princes, only on a smaller scale.</p>
            <p>Marked changes in the relations between the royal court and the principalities and the tributary states began with the Ch'un-ch'iu period (770—481 B. C.), after King <name type="pname">Yu</name> was killed by the invading Ch'üan-jung barbarians and the armies of two rebel feudatories in 771 B. C. In the following year the new king, King <name type="pname">P'ing</name>, abandoned the old capital of <name type="place">Tsung</name> Chou in modern central Shensi and moved to Ch'üng Chou or Lo-i in modern central <name type="place">Honan</name>. This event caused the royal court of Chou to lose a great part of its domain in the west and an immeasurable amount of power and prestige. During some five hundred thirty years which followed, the royal power of Chou was on a steady decline.</p>
            <p>In 707 B. C. the state of Chüng, bordering the royal domain on the south, rebelled against the Chou king, and in a battle the king was wounded by a Chüng general. After that, the Heavenly King suffered disgrace upon disgrace. The principalities assumed complete independance, ignoring their obligations. During the two hundred forty-two years from 722 to 481 B. C. the princes of the state of <name type="place">Lu</name> had only two audiences <hi rend="italic">(ch'ao</hi>) with the Chou king and visited <hi rend="italic">(ju</hi>) the royal capital only once; while, on the other hand, they paid eleven courtesy calls on the state of <name type="place">Ch'i</name> and twenty on the state of <name type="place">Ch'in</name>. To the seven visits by the envoys of the king the princes of Lu returned only four through their emissaries.<ref target="#CH9-n9">9</ref> With the reduction of its ceremonial obligations Lu stopped also its material obligations
<pb n="229"/>
toward the Son of Heaven. Yet Lu was only a small state; the conduct of the bigger and more powerful states can easily be visualized. As a suzerain power the royal court of Chou was now more nominal than real. Thus the regional autonomy which was inherent in the very nature of political feudalism and which had made its existence apaprent from the very beginning came into the open and in full power.</p>
            <p>Local autonomy displayed itself in a number of other ways. Ignoring the authority of the king, who alone was supposed to decide upon waging war or making peace, the powerful princes independently warred against the lesser states and annexed them to their own territories, regardless of the fact that these states had been created by mandate of the <name type="pname">Chou</name> king just as had their own fiefs. Rebelling again against old traditions, the states of <name type="place">Chüng</name> and Chin proclaimed new law codes,<ref target="#CH9-n10">10</ref> and the state of <name type="place">Lu</name> introduced taxes on private land.<ref target="#CH9-n11">11</ref> In defiance of the "Royal Regulations" Lu set up three armies instead of the two allowed to it by law,<ref target="#CH9-n12">12</ref> and similarly Chin established six armies instead of three.<ref target="#CH9-n13">13</ref> Both Lu and Chüng adopted new ways of exacting military service and military contributions.<ref target="#CH9-n14">14</ref> Arrogating to themselves the prerogatives of the Son of Heaven, the most powerful princes compelled the weaker feudatories to divert the tribute due the royal court to them.</p>
            <p>While the principalities achieved autonomy, the tributary states attained complete independence. Within the feudatories the princes experienced similar decline of power as did the king in the kingdom.
<pb n="230"/>
In the state of Chin the princely power had long been contested among the important noble families, three of which eventually divided the principality in 431 B. C. into three states: <name type="place">Han</name>, <name type="place">Chao</name> and <name type="place">Liang</name> (Wei). The real power of the state of <name type="place">Lu</name> was in the hands of three families from whom the prince was never able to retrieve it. From the sixth century on, the most important noble family in the state of Ch'i was the T'ien (Ch'ün in the bronze inscriptions), which became so arrogant that it established its measures of capacity side by side with the official measures of the state<ref target="#CH9-n15">15</ref> and eventually usurped the reign in the seventies of the fourth century.</p>
            <p>All of this we learn from either literary sources or archaeological evidence. There must have been many other similar events about which records were not made or have not been preserved.</p>
            <p>In the Chan-kuo period (403—221 B. C.), we find that the authority of the Chou king was further curtailed, if indeed he still had any authority beyond his own domain at all. In the fourth century all the princes of the major states had appropriated the title of "king" <hi rend="italic">(<name type="pname">wang</name>
               </hi>), thus elevating themselves formally to equality with the Chou royalty, though in reality they were much superior in power. As a consequence, the old <name type="pname">Chou</name> king could lay claim to no more special privileges.</p>
            <p>With the deprivation of the exclusive use of the title of "king" came further reductions of the domain of Chou. In 426 B. C., the principality of Eastern Chou was established, occupying its eastern section to match the Western Chou principality which occupied the western section. As a result, what was left of the Chou domain was but the city of <name type="place">Lo-yang</name> (east of its modern city namesake in central northern <name type="place">Honan</name>) with the limited surrounding area. In 367 B. C. the states of <name type="place">Han</name> and <name type="place">Chao</name> made Western and the Eastern Chou autonomous and brought them under their respective domination.<ref target="#CH9-n16">16</ref>
               <pb n="231"/>
They thus deprived Chou of its last two feudatories, and reduced it to a city. The last king of <name type="pname">Chou</name>, <name type="pname">King Nan</name>, becoming king in 316 B. C., had to abandon his city and go to the Western Chou for protection.<ref target="#CH9-n17">17</ref> Actually Chou was no more, though officially it ended in 256 B. C. at the death of King <name type="pname">Nan</name>.</p>
            <p>The above historical description of some features of the political feudalism of the Chou dynasty and especially concerning the relations between the royal court and its princely states and between the princely house and the lesser nobility, shows that enfeudation under the Chou system was a grant of important privileges and a delegation of administrative powers approaching autonomy. Whatever the incipient features of Chou feudalism, the feudatories, especially the large ones, eventually attained independence by neglecting their obligations to the royal court, by extending the basic privileges granted, and by assuming many others which may or may not have had a legal foundation. Since, from the very beginning, the principalities possessed authority over the land and the population within their boundaries, and since from the eighth century on they became independent, establishing their own institutions in financial, legal and military matters, it should be beyond any doubt that they also had the right of casting coins. The same must be true of the tributary states.</p>
            <p>That coinage in China of Chou was not a royal prerogative but a privilege enjoyed by the feudatories and tributary states as well seems to be borne out also by the varieties in the shapes of the coins and by the differences in monetary designations and monetary units of the coinages of the period. In the state of Ch'i the coinage was the knife. In Ch'u it was the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi>. In the royal domain of Chou and other states it was the spade. Each had a special monetary unit, and each its own denominational system. Different from all other states, Ch'u cast coins of gold.</p>
            <pb n="232"/>
            <p>In 336 B. C. when the state of Ch'in established and issued its official currency (Late Spade IV), King <name type="pname">Hsien</name> of Chou hastened to send his congratulations on the event. The action of the Chou royalty implies not only that the state coinage of Ch'in was not a royal grant but also that it had nothing to do with the time-honored royal superiority of Chou. As a matter of fact, it is improper for us to speak of "royal grant" at this point because at this time the ruler of Ch'in had already assumed the title of "king" himself and had thus elevated himself to the same level as the Chou royalty. It is altogether out of the question that the action of one king had to be ratified beforehand by another.</p>
            <p>The coin specimens do not reveal whether the lesser nobility in the principality had the right of minting coins, but many mint names of the spades were names of cities or towns held as fiefs by lesser nobles at the time the coins were cast. Chih of the Hollow-handle Spade (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 2) was the fief of the Chih family (<name type="pname">Hsün Ying</name> and his descendants) of the state of Chin from the end of the seventh century on.<ref target="#CH9-n18">18</ref>
               <name type="pname">Tung Chou</name> (Eastern Chou) was a feudatory established in 426 B. C., and as a mint it cast the small Hollow-handle Spades bearing its name (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 3). <name type="pname">Chin-yang</name> was the fief of the Chao family of Chin during the Ch'un-ch'iu period and the first capital of the state of Chao established by the same family at the beginning of the Chan-kuo period. Bearing the name of the city are both Old Spades (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, 3—5) and Late Spades (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXI, 1—3) which were cast when the city was in the possession of the Chao family. <name type="pname">P'ing-yang</name> was the seat of Lord of <name type="pname">P'ing-yang</name> enfeoffed by the prince of the state of <name type="place">Chao</name>. The preserved coins bearing the name of the city are Late Spades which were in circulation in the corresponding period during which the city was in possession of the Lord of <name type="pname">P'ing-yang</name>.<ref target="#CH9-n19">19</ref> The mint of Wu-an of the Late Spades (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi>
               <pb n="233"/>
XXI, 6) is the fief of Lord of <name type="pname">Wu-an</name>, Su Ch'in, enfeoffed by Marquis Hsü (349—326 B. C.) of Chao, when that type of spade was in circulation.<ref target="#CH9-n20">20</ref> The mint of the Late Spades of An-yang (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XXII,. 2—3, to be distinguished from the An-yang of Ch'in established in 257 B. C. which cast Late Spade IV) was the fief of the eldest son of King <name type="pname">Hui-wün</name> of Chao from 296 B. C. on.<ref target="#CH9-n21">21</ref> The An-yang Late Spades were issued before the middle of the third century B. C. During the round coinage period, Tung Chou and Hsi Chou (Western Chou) cast this type of currency (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> LI V, 5; LIII, 6 respectively). Both were feudatories when the round coins were in use.</p>
            <p>We can add to the list a few more mint names of spades which were also the names of cities or towns held as fiefs by the lesser nobles in various principalities. Those mentioned already should be sufficient to illustrate our point that minor fief holders appear to have enjoyed the privilege of coinage. It may be questioned how one can assert with assurance that the spade coins bearing the names of certain cities held as fiefs by the lesser nobles did not come from the mint of the prince who, for one reason or another, had the names of particular localities inscribed upon it.<ref target="#CH9-n22">22</ref> To be sure, in such details of history there is seldom absolute certainty, but, considering the general feudal pattern prevailing at that time, our assumption seems plausible.</p>
            <p>Further evidence for the assumption is derived from the fact that the names of feudal states never appear as mint names on the spade coins. If coinage had been a prerogative of princes which was denied to the lesser nobility, the name of their state rather than local cities should have been given in the legends. This happens nowhere, for even the coins from the mint of the prince bear only the name of the city which is his capital. It appears that, as far as
<pb n="234"/>
coinage is concerned, the king minted coins for circulation in his domain; the prince could do the same for his principality; the head of a tributary state for his realm; the lesser nobles for their own fiefs.</p>
            <p>However, the situation in the state of Ch'i during the period of the Early Knife seems to be different. As far as the many hundreds of the Early Knives of that state are concerned, they all bear the name of the state, <name type="place">Ch'i</name>, not of the name of its capital (<name type="place">Ying-ch'iu</name>, later <name type="place">Lin-tzŭ</name>) or of any other city or town. This characteristic seems to have a profound implication, if the style of inscription of the coin had anything to do with the right of coinage. If it did, and so it appears to us, the prince of Ch'i possessed the exclusive right of coinage during the period of the Early Knives, just like the rulers of Chi-mo, An-yang and T'an, which were then independent states in the east beyond the boundaries of the Chou kingdom. At this point it may not be superfluous to repeat our suggestion that the first knife coinage of Ch'i probably was an imitation of the coinage of those eastern states. Even if the right of coinage was a princely prerogative in the state of Ch'i, we are not at all certain whether open or clandestine minting of the official currency by the lesser nobility or private individuals was countenanced. During the late Ch'un-ch'iu and early Chan-kuo periods, when the Late Knives were in circulation, the prince's exclusive right of coinage seems to have disappeared. At this time T'an, an ancient autonomous state which had been annexed by Ch'i to form part of its territory, cast its own knives, of which hundreds have been recovered in modern Po-shan county in eastern <name type="place">Shantung</name>. A passage in the <hi rend="italic">Mo-tzŭ,</hi> which probably was written by a disciple or follower of Mo Ti (fifth century B. C.) in the state of Ch'i in the fourth century, states, "The kingly knife never changes.".<ref target="#CH8-n23">23</ref> This statement would indicate that, at the time the passage was written, there were already knife coins other than those issued by the king of <name type="pname">Ch'i</name>.</p>
            <pb n="235"/>
            <p>The coinage of the state of Ch'u presents a similar picture to that of Ch'i, but, unlike that of Ch'i, the mint names of the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> of Ch'u are the names of the capitals (<name type="place">Ying, Ch'ün</name>) of the state. In this case, the name of the capital was used in the same sense as the name of the state. The use of the name of the state capital as mint name may also signify a centralization of the right of coinage. But the <hi rend="italic">yüan-chin</hi> discovered so far have been few in number. Any conclusion based on a limited quantity of material may not correspond to the fact.</p>
            <p>The first state monopoly of coinage about which we are fairly sure was the state coinage established by <name type="place">King Hui-wün</name> of Ch'in in 336 B. C. The monetary policy of King <name type="pname">Hui-wün</name> was followed by his descendants, and was applied to the whole of ancient <name type="place">China</name> in 221 B. C. by the First Emperor (Shih-huang-ti) after he conquered the other states and unified <name type="place">China</name>.</p>
            <p>Leaving the problem of the right of coinage enjoyed by the aristocracy of Chou and its tributary states, we come finally to the problem of the right of coinage enjoyed by the common people. Our question is: Were people of common origin in the state of <name type="place">Ch'in</name> before 336 B. C. and other states before 221 B. C. allowed to cast coins? Regarding this question, there is absolutely no information of either early or late origin. However, an indication may be obtained from the policies, especially the monetary policy, of the founder of the Han (or Former Han) dynasty (206 B. C.—8 A.D.) which replaced the Ch'in dynasty. The essence of the policies of Liu Pang, founder of the <name type="pname">Han</name>, in civil affairs was to reverse the centralization of Ch'in and to restore the traditions of the old Chou.<ref target="#CH9-n24">24</ref> Abolishing the centralized administration of Ch'in, Liu Pang restored the feudal political system of Chou by setting up feudal states in the greater part of the Han empire. Abrogating the imperial monopoly on the production of salt and iron, he made them free industries. Abandoning the imperial prerogative in coinage, he
<pb n="236"/>
"ordered the people to cast coins,"<ref target="#CH9-n25">25</ref> to remedy, as contemporary statesmen and writers used to say, "the abuses of the Ch'in dynasty." Since these "abuses," which included the imperial monopoly of coinage, were of Ch'in creation, Liu Pang's decree of free coinage must be understood as a restoration of a pre-Ch'in or Chou tradition. Therefore, it is our belief that during the Chou period, at least during its later part and specifically before 336 B. C. in the state of <name type="place">Ch'in</name> and before 221 B. C. in the other states, whoever had the means among common people were allowed to cast coins.</p>

               <p>In all the writings about the political organizations of <name type="place">Chou</name> no distinction has ever been made between these two catagories of subject states of <name type="place">Chou</name>. They have always been treated as the same and lumped together under the general appellation, <hi rend="italic">Chu hou kuo</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_232.jpg"/> or "the states of the <hi rend="italic">hou." Hou</hi>, which term has been unsatisfactorily rendered as "Marquis," originally meant "military scout" or "military outpost." It finally became the designation for the king's man who received the authority to rule and guard a frontier region for the purpose of protecting the Chou royalty. The region was granted to him as his fief from which he was to exact whatever he needed. In theory, his fief was the property of the king who alone had final authority over it, but in practice the <hi rend="italic">hou</hi> kept it as his own possession and handed it down to his children. In the fief, which is generally called "principality" in the text, the governmental organization was modelled in smaller scale on the organization of the <name type="place">Chou</name> royal court. Hence the identity of official titles of the royal court and the principality. The persons who received a principality were either relatives of the royal house or meritorious assistants of the king. As inferiors to the king they were never called <hi rend="italic">wang</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_235a.jpg"/> (king) before the fourth century B. C.<lb/>
The tributary states were old states which submitted to <name type="place">Chou</name> voluntarily or by compulsion short of force. Their original political organization was retained, and so was also the title of their rulers, <hi rend="italic">wang.</hi> Hsü <graphic url="NNM122_235b.jpg"/> in modern northern Kiangsu and Anhui, Wu <graphic url="NNM122_235c.jpg"/> in southern Kiangsu, and Ch'u <graphic url="NNM122_235d.jpg"/> in Hupeh were the most famous of them. Strictly speaking, the head of a tributary state was not regarded as a <hi rend="italic">hou</hi> of <name type="place">Chou</name>; nor was he so called. Usually he called himself <hi rend="italic">wang</hi> (king), though the <name type="place">Chou</name> authority called him <hi rend="italic">po</hi>
                  <graphic url="NNM122_235e.jpg"/> (chief) or <hi rend="italic">fang po</hi>

               <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Wang chih</hi> or "Royal Regulations," which was written in the first half of the second century B. C. and is contained in the present text of the <hi rend="italic">Li chi</hi>, it is stated that the Son of Heaven, i. e., the King of Chou appointed all three officials of "ministerial rank" <hi rend="italic">(ch'ng</hi>) of the large principality, two of the three of the second-rate principality, and neither of the two of the smallest principality. This reported regulation, which is partially confirmed, appears to be a supervisory measure by the king over the large feudatories. It is so interpreted by the Han scholars who prepared the document just referred. But whether the Han scholars' statement on the "Royal Regulations" entirely corresponds to the fact and whether the supervisory measure was effective are both uncertain. Even if so, the measure did not remain effective for long. For as early as 709 B. C. the Chou king had already become merely a titular authority in the matter of the appointment of the ministers of the large principality. In this year Duke Wu of Ch'ü-wo (i. e., <name type="pname">Duke Wu</name> of Chin) promised <name type="pname">Juan Kung-tzŭ</name> to recommend him to the Chou king and have him appointed as the first minister for the state of Chin <hi rend="italic">(Kuo</hi> yü,VII, 1a).</p>

OBJECTS WRONGLY REGARDED AS MONEY</hi>
            </head>
            <p>In catalogues one usually finds illustrations of some objects which have been regarded as money or media of exchange at some time or other in Chinese antiquity. Scrupulous numismatists classify them as "Money That Cannot Be Investigated" <hi rend="italic">(Wu k'ao ch'ien</hi>) and some dealers have called them "barter money." These objects are the so-called <hi rend="italic">Ou hsin ch'ien</hi> (Lily-root-heart money), the <hi rend="italic">Ling ch'ien</hi> (Bell money), the <hi rend="italic">Ch'iao pi</hi> (Bridge money) which is also called <hi rend="italic">Ch'ing pi</hi> (Dingle-dangle money), and the <hi rend="italic">Yü pi (Fish money),</hi> etc.</p>
            <p>Lacouperie has shown that the "Lily-root-heart money" was not money.<ref target="#APX1-n1">1</ref> We must add, however, that at the time the so-called "Lily-root-heart money" inscribed with the date of "Yüan-yen ssŭ nien" (9 B. C.) was made, the official money for ordinary use was <hi rend="italic">Wu-chu</hi> copper cash (silver and gold was used only rarely). The coin was round in shape with a square hole in the center, the standard shape and design ever since 221 B. C. As money the <hi rend="italic">Wu-chu</hi> was immeasurably superior to the "Lily-root-heart money." The two forms could not have been circulating as money side by side with each other. It is irrational to assume that such a crude and clumsy object as the "Lily-root-heart" had been used as money at a time when the Chinese monetary system had had a history of centuries and had reached the peak of its development (so far as its shape and design are concerned) before the introduction of Western methods of striking at the end of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, "Lily-root-heart" as money is not found in the <hi rend="italic">Shih huo chih</hi> (Treatise on Food and Money), Chapter XXIV of the <hi rend="italic">Han shu,</hi> the second part of which is 
<pb n="238"/>
a rather detailed record of the governmental finance and the minting of money from 221 B. C. to 23 A. D.<ref target="#APX1-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We do not know to what use the "Lily-root-heart" was put during the Han times. Lacouperie suggests that it might have been a sort of tally, but he offers no proof.</p>
            <p>There is abundant proof that the "Bell money" was not money. The most convincing is the fact that bells of the shapes in coin catalogues have been found in tombs of the Han or post-Han period together with the <hi rend="italic">Wu-chu</hi> coins. For instance, in the tombs designated as A 5 and A 7 at the Tou-chi-t'ai (Fighting Cocks Terrace) in Pao-chi county in western Shensi such a bell was recovered together with 162 <hi rend="italic">Wu-chu</hi> coins. In the tomb designated as D 4 one such bell was found together with 38 <hi rend="italic">Wu-chu</hi> coins. In tomb D 5 one bell was discovered with 3 <hi rend="italic">Wu-chu</hi> coins.<ref target="#APX1-n3">3</ref> For practically the same reasons we rejected the so-called "Lily-root-heart money" as money, we must reject the bells also.</p>
            <p>The so-called "Dingle-dangle money" is a miniature of an ancient musical instrument called the <hi rend="italic">ch'ing,</hi> whence the numismatists term <hi rend="italic">"Ch'ing pi"</hi> Looking like a miniature musical instrument, the object was buried with the dead to be used by the soul in the other world. This explanation of their use resulted from investigations of Shang Ch'üng-tso, who studied the report of the finds in an old tomb of the house of Ch'u, a feudatory of Chou, discovered in Ch'ang-sha, Hunan.<ref target="#APX1-n4">4</ref> Shang Ch'üng-tso's finding should be sufficient to disprove the allegation that the object at issue was money.</p>
            <p>Of the four kinds of objects mentioned above only "fish" remains to be investigated. While the credulous numismatists who believe that it was money offer no proof, we have no direct evidence to disprove
<pb n="239"/>
it. The fish as illustrated in the catalogues of Chinese coins and in the articles on Chinese primitive money are largely of two kinds, different in shape and in skill of casting. While one type is slender and finely cast, the other is thicker and crudely made. The size varies in both types. According to their size, Nishimura divides them into three major classes: large, medium and small, the last of which is further divided into seven minor groups based on slight differences in designs.<ref target="#APX1-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Invariably, all of them, large or small, finely or crudely made, have a hole in the head. This is probably the reason which leads numismatists to the belief that they were money. Reports say that most of the fish have been unearthed along the Yellow River in Honan, but the circumstances in which they were discovered are not known. In the tomb designated as F 5 at the Tou-chi-t'ai, Pao-chi, Shensi, 93 pieces of copper fish of the crudely made variety were unearthed.<ref target="#APX1-n6">6</ref> None was found in any other of the 103 tombs in the same area. Judging from the position in which they were discovered, Su Ping-ch'i, who took part in the excavation, thinks that they were ornamental objects for the coffin.<ref target="#APX1-n7">7</ref> According <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Su's chronology which is based on the shape of the legs in the early tripods (called <hi rend="italic">li),</hi> the tomb containing the bronze fish should be dated to the so-called "short-legged <hi rend="italic">li"</hi> period, which falls within the Chou dynasty. Yet for this period, we cannot find any historical record or archaeological evidence which would indicate that bronze fish had been used as money at this time.</p>

SPADES OF PROBABLE POST-CHOU ORIGIN (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVII)</head>
            <p>Among preserved spade coins there is one type which may have a post-Chou origin. So far as discovered, spades of this type are of two sizes, both of which appear to have been contemporary. The larger is distinguished by its extraordinarily long body and slender shape (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVII, 1). It bears a legend of five characters on the obverse and another of two on the reverse. The content of both is unusual.</p>
            <p>Because of these characteristics the spade has attracted much attention, and its legends have had various decipherments. The two-character legend on the reverse is not difficult to read: it is <hi rend="italic">shih huo</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_248.jpg"/> or "Ten <hi rend="italic">huo"</hi> as generally accepted by numismatists. As has been discussed in Chapter VIII, <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> was the monetary unit of the knife coinage.</p>
            <p>Unlike that of the reverse the obverse legend of five characters has remained a controversial subject up to today. The author of the <hi rend="italic">Ch'ien hui (Comprehensive Catalogue of Coins</hi>) reads it <hi rend="italic">ch'u pu tang shih huo</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_250a.jpg"/>, meaning "Special spade equivalent to ten <hi rend="italic">huo."</hi> Ma Ang reads it as <hi rend="italic">ch'i pi tang chin shih</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_250b.jpg"/>, which according to his interpretation means "Long (coin); Compared with (another coin) it is worth ten <hi rend="italic">chin." Chin</hi> as a monetary unit has also been discussed in Chapter VIII. Chiang Tü-liang (Ch'iu-shih) and Sun Hsing-yen (Yüan-ju) read it as <hi rend="italic">fu pi tang shih chin</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_250c.jpg"/>
               <graphic url="NNM122_250d.jpg"/>, which, in their opinion, means "Four of this coin are equivalent to ten <hi rend="italic">chin"</hi> This decipherment and interpretation is accepted by the famous numismatist, Ch'u Shang-ling <ref target="#APX2-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>For the sake of convenience, let us separate the whole legend into two parts, with the first two characters constituting the first
<pb n="241"/>
part and the other three characters the second. In respect to the first two characters, none of the decipherments can be regarded as satisfactory. In fact, those decipherments are so ill-founded epigraphically and the interpretations suggested for them are so artificial that they can hardly convince any one. In 1903 Ch'in Pao-tsan in his <hi rend="italic">I hsia lu</hi> proposed to read the first two characters as <hi rend="italic">p'ei ch'ien</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_250e.jpg"/>
               <ref target="#APX2-n2">2</ref> As we have mentioned previously, <hi rend="italic">ch'ien,</hi> written <graphic url="NNM122_251a.jpg"/> in modern script, was another name for spade coins. Ch'in Pao-tsan proposes that P'ei, written <graphic url="NNM122_251b.jpg"/> in the modern script, was the city located in the northern part of present Kiangsu province. Both his decipherments and his identification for P'ei have been acclaimed by Lo Po-chao, a noted contemporary numismatist,<ref target="#APX2-n3">3</ref> and there are good reasons for his enthusiasm. Epigraphically, the decipherment of the first character as <hi rend="italic">p'ei</hi> is plausible, and that of the second as <hi rend="italic">ch'ien</hi> should be satisfactory. Furthermore, the provenance of the coin is restricted to various localities in northern Kiangsu,<ref target="#APX2-n4">4</ref> and this tends to confirm that it was cast by the old city of P'ei.</p>
            <p>Two readings have been suggested for the second part or the last three characters of the whole legend, <hi rend="italic">tang shih chin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tang shih huo</hi>. The second reading is untenable, because the last character while showing no resemblance to the character for <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>, looks structurally exactly like the basic component part of the character <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_251c.jpg"/>, the monetary unit of the spade coinage, and as that it must be regarded. The phrase <hi rend="italic">tang shih chin</hi> implies that the coin with this specification must have been intended for use as equivalent to ten <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> units. This reminds us of the Special Old Spade of Liang of high denomination which is specified in its legend to be equivalent to five <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>.</p>
            <p>Combining the two parts of the whole legend we thus arrive at the
<pb n="242"/>
following decipherment: <hi rend="italic">P'ei ch'ien tang shih chin</hi>
               <graphic url="NNM122_251d.jpg"/> meaning, "Spade of P'ei, worth [lit. "to stand for"] ten <hi rend="italic">chin."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like the phrase <hi rend="italic">tang shih chin,</hi> the inscription on the reverse of the spade "Ten <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>" must be also taken to mean that the coin with this inscription was to be used as equivalent to so many <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> units. If we read the coin's inscriptions as a whole, we will have such a long legend: <hi rend="italic">P'ei ch'ien tang shih chin</hi>, <hi rend="italic">shih huo</hi> or, "Spade of P'ei, worth ten <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> or ten <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>."</p>
            <p>As is clearly implied in the legend, the spade of this type was cast to be used as an inter-regional currency, good in the region where the <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> was the monetary unit as well as in the region where the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> was the monetary unit. Comparable to this type of spade we have only the Special Old Spades of Liang, which were coins to be used in both <hi rend="italic">lieh</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> areas.</p>
            <p>Was this type of spade also of Chou origin, as were the Special Old Spades of Liang? Lo Po-chao and Chüng Chia-hsiang, whom he quotes, doubt that. They regard it as a type of coin cast in the years between the fall of Ch'in dynasty (207 B. C.) and the establishment of the Han dynasty (202 B. C.). The reasons for their opinion are: first, that "Among the ancient spade coins none has been specified with the denomination of Ten <hi rend="italic">huo"</hi> (Chüng Chia-hsiang); and, secondly, that they were found not in the "north" as the spades of the Chou period were, but were "mostly in Kiangsu and Chekiang" (Lo Po-chao).<ref target="#APX2-n5">5</ref> Although these reasons are not sufficient, or even relevant, for determining the date of this type of spade, the possibility of the late origin of the coin cannot be denied. The evidence, as we see it, is as follows:</p>
            <p>1. The weight of the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> monetary unit as expressed in this type of spades is very small. Six specimens from the collection of the American Numismatic Society have been weighed and the results show: 36.96, 36.10, 29.56, 33.13, 32.18, and 35.90 grams.</p>
            <p>The average weight of these six specimens is 33.92 grams. Since a spade of this type was to be used as ten <hi rend="italic">chin</hi>, then the weight of one
<pb n="243"/>
               <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> is 3.39 grams. This is incomparably smaller than the <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> unit of the Old Spade (average 13. grams), or the Late Spade (average 12 grams), or even that of the Round Coin, which as shown by the specimen of Yü is 8.22 grams. Since the weight of the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> had been on steady decrease ever since its adoption, and since its weight in connection with the type of the spade at issue is even much smaller than that of the Round Coin which was the latest coin type of the Chou period, it should be natural to assume that this type of spade maybe later than the Round Coin; in other words, it may be of post-Chou origin.</p>
            <p>2. The supposition of its being of post-Chou origin is supported by the style in which the character for the monetary unit <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> is written. During the Chou period, <hi rend="italic">huo</hi> as the monetary unit of the knife coinage is written <graphic url="NNM122_253a.jpg"/> or, in an abbreviated form, <graphic url="NNM122_253b.jpg"/>; the fuller form shown on the right side of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVII, 1 is never found. It is the fuller form which directly becomes stylized into the form of the modern character, <graphic url="NNM122_253c.jpg"/>
               <hi rend="italic">huo</hi>. <graphic url="NNM122_253d.jpg"/> alone, is now pronounced <hi rend="italic">hua).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In view of these facts, Chüng Chia-hsiang's and Lo Pao-chao's suggestion that this type of spade was cast after the fall of Ch'in and before the establishment of Han is plausible. Since the rebels were bent on destroying everything that had formed part of the institutions of the "tyrannical Ch'in," some of their leaders, possibly descendants of old noble families, might have attempted to restore the monetary system to the forms current under Chou.</p>
            <p>Who cast them ? Lo Pao-chao believes that it was the Western Ch'u (206 —202 B. C.), in whose territory the suggested mint city of P'ei was located.<ref target="#APX2-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>If all these suggestions are correct, we see that along with the overthrow of the totalitarian Ch'in regime and the restoration of the political conditions of Chou, there was revived one of the economic institutions of that period, the spade monetary system, in certain parts of <name type="place">China</name> at the end of the third century B. C.</p>
            <pb n="244"/>
            <p>Now we must say a few words about the small type of the post-Chou spades. The legend of this <hi rend="italic">type</hi> of spade, which is placed on both sides of the coin is much simpler and involves no great difficulties. It reads <hi rend="italic">Ssŭ ch'ien tang shih chin</hi>. <graphic url="NNM122_254.jpg"/>. The last four characters are identical with those of the large type discussed above. Most numismatists regard the first character of the legend, <hi rend="italic">ssŭ</hi>, as the numeral for "four," but Lo Po-chao contends that it is the name of the mint city, which was the capital of the Ssŭ-shui Province of the Cirin dynasty.<ref target="#APX2-n7">7</ref> According to the former opinion, the legend means "Four of this spade are equivalent to ten <hi rend="italic">chin;"</hi> but according to Lo Po-chao, it means "Spade of Ssŭ, worth ten chin." Since this type of spade appears to have been contemporary with the large post-Chou spade discussed above and since two of them (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVII, 2 shows two spades attached together) weigh only 15.25 grams, or about half the weight of the large type, the reading of the character as the numeral for "four" sounds reasonable. Since, as a rule, the first character in the legends of all spades of the Chou period (after which this type of coin was modelled) is the name of the mint city, Lo Po-chao's suggestion appears also plausible. This is the kind of problem which can be solved definitively only after more material and information are available.</p>
            <p>Finally, it may be interesting to note that, judging from the shape of the coins and the design of their inscriptions, this type of spade appears to have been the direct model after which Wang Mang (9—23 A. D.) cast his spade coins in his attempt to restore the monetary system of Chou as he understood it. For his spades resemble the spade under discussion in every aspect and do not have as much in common with the spades of the Chou period. In other words, the restoration of the monetary system of Chou by Wang Mang was a copy of the first attempted restoration of the economic institution at the end of the third century B. C.</p>
