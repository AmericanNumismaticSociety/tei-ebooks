            <p>The far-reaching historical implications of the late Roman and Byzantine gold coinage, from the fifth century through the eighth, have made this
               period the focus of a great deal of research in recent decades. A great wealth of material awaits collection and interpretation, and it is not
               yet possible to produce a synthetic monograph on all aspects of the subject. This volume brings together contributions on various topics in the
               hope of demonstrating how current progress has been made possible by new or refined methods as well as by the evidence of new finds. The
               following introductory remarks are intended to provide a summary of the current state of scholarship and a rough sketch of the problems that
               remain to be solved.</p>
            <p>Numismatic considerations, which are closely related to the political history of the period, define the termini of this volume. The permanent
               division of the empire between Arcadius and Honorius was reflected by different developments in the coinages of the East and the West. Various
               attempts to assimilate the western half of the empire during the sixth and seventh centuries all failed in the end, but they provide a fertile
               field for the study of monetary politics. By the end of the eighth century the empire had lost most of its western dependencies—notably the
               African and Italian exarchates—and with those losses provincial mints virtually ceased to exist.</p>
            <p>These centuries have fared unevenly at the hands of numismatists. The period of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_anastasius">Anastasius
                  I</name>, in modern times regarded as the beginning of the Byzantine coinage proper, has recently drawn the attention of several scholars, but
               the fifth century has been poorly served by modern studies, especially as the framework that could be provided by <hi rend="italic">RIC</hi> 10
               is still lacking. The old studies of Sabatier for the East and Cohen for the West lack photographic documentation and are in any case inadequate,
               since coins of the eastern and western emperors are listed separately and without regard to the mints that produced them.<ref target="#CH1-n1"
                  >1</ref> Eastern and western coins are confused, and those of the empresses are ascribed to their husband, with the consequence that (for
               example) the eastern issues of Galla Placidia and the western ones of Pulcheria are concealed, as is the entire system of mutual recognition
               pieces so characteristic of fifth century coinage. The distribution of issues of empresses who struck under more than one ruler has also been
                  obscured.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Tolstoi's</name> work on the eastern emperors is written in much the same tradition and presents a wealth of material, but is
               confined mainly to coins in his own collection and that in the Hermitage with additional references to Sabatier. For the West Robertson's recent
               catalogue of a much more limited collection unfortunately follows the same princple.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref>
               <name type="pname">Hahn</name> has dealt with the eastern gold and silver coinage of the reign of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</name>, and a similar study covering the
               period through the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_zeno">Zeno</name> is in preparation; but for the West the work of Ulrich-Bana stands as a solitary
               milestone in a field otherwise tilled by amateurs.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The most urgent desideratum remains the continued accumulation of numismatic material to permit the most detailed possible study of the coinage.
               The systematic listing of hoards and <pb n="8"/> stray finds will provide a reliable picture of monetary circulation and should confirm mint
               attributions based on stylistic criteria. Sorting out the attributions of gold coins not distinguished by specific mint marks and allocating them
               to different mints will yield the outlines of monetary administration.</p>
            <p>Moreover, though the studies of <name type="pname">W. E. Metcalf</name>, <name type="pname">C. Morrisson</name>, and <name type="pname">D. M.
                  Metcalf</name> below are virtually unparalleled in the Byzantine series, the compilation of similar die studies for other mints will permit
               insight into their activities and provide at least a relative idea of output, which is perhaps the most important question for economic
               historians.</p>
            <p>The connection between civil, fiscal, and monetary administration has been set out by <name type="pname">J. P. C. Kent</name> and <name
                  type="pname">Hendy</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> As we now have a good idea where and when to look for gold mints, the possible
               attributions have been considerably reduced and are more securely based. The guiding principle is the division of the gold coinage into the
               regular production of the four praetorian prefectures (<name type="place">Orien</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_illyricum">Illyricum</name>, <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>, and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>) plus some extraordinary cases (<name
                  type="place">the Crimea</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily"
                  >Sicily</name>) in which the existence of a gold mint is at least a possibility. Under special conditions military mints seem to have been
               active temporarily in the East during the troubled first quarter of the seventh century.</p>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e522" type="section">

               </head>
               <p>The overwhelming preponderance of gold coinage was stuck in and for the eastern prefecture, where the metropolitan <hi rend="italic">moneta
                     auri</hi> operated continuously with a number of officinae; usually ten were charged with the production of solidi, the main denomination.
                  One must suppose that fractions and ceremonial pieces (in gold and silver) were struck in a single officina, which did not need to mark its
                  coins, although it is uncertain whether this officina (or these officinae, if each denomination came from a separate workshop) is to be
                  identified with one of the ten solidus officinae or is in addition to them. During the fifth and (rarely) the seventh centuries a portion of
                  the Constantinopolitan solidi, in many types, lack an officina number. These unmarked pieces may have been struck at the beginning of every
                  issue, since they are relatively much more numerous in short issues than in longer ones.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> Perhaps this is to be
                  explained on the assumption that special orders were given for the striking of distribution pieces, outside the normal quotas of the
                  officinae, on the occasion of accessions or anniversaries or for other ceremonial purposes connected with the introduction of new types.</p>
               <p>Several explanations have been proposed for cases in which solidi of Constantinopolitan fabric display officina numbers higher than ten. In
                  the seventh century the additional letter was probably an issue mark.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> In the rare cases of sixth century solidi
                  with higher numbers, other interpretations may be required: additional officinae detached for use in other regions,<ref target="#CH1-n8"
                     >8</ref> indictional dates,<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> cooperation between two officinae, or reference to a special weight standad.<ref
                     target="#CH1-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Where secret or issue marks are involved, their proper purpose is debatable. Possible explanations include marking of an extraordinary issue
                  with a numeral indicating its date, amount, or occasion, a special destination ordered by one or another department of the state for
                  distribution purposes, or a special metal source. The mark ⊖ is especially frequent.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> It should be noted that
                     <pb n="9"/> the occurrence of these secret marks suddenly increases under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>,
                  when the government had to resort to loans. Dates were twice introduced to the regular solidi of <name type="place">Constantinople</name>,
                  then abandoned: 567/8 and 635-50; while a temporary preponderance of the fifth and tenth officinae over the others (especially around 610) is
                  explained by C. Morrisson, who postulates the connection of different officinae with certain state departments.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref>
                  The high standard of weight and fineness (97 to 99 percent) was maintained in Constantinople throughout the period with only a minor decline
                  under Constans II and Constantine IV.<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Stylistically, the Constantinopolitan gold coins display great uniformity: doubtless there were several die engravers working simultaneously
                  with shared punches. This often makes comparison of obverse dies very difficult.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> A broader range of style can
                  be observed when a single type is struck in large quantity or over a long period;<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> this is due to changes over
                  the course of time rather than to the existence of different eastern mints. Under normal circumstances there were no mints other than
                  Constantinople in the eastern prefecture. The fanciful attributions of <name type="pname">D. Ricotti Prina</name> (<name type="place"
                     >Nicomedia</name>, <name type="place">Cyzicus</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name>)<ref
                     target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> are untenable, and the acceptance of <name type="pname">Grierson's</name> incorrect attributions of
                  sixth-century solidi to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> is unforunate.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A more serious candidate for a gold coinage in the East is Alexandria, capital of the diocese of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt"
                     >Egypt</name>, which had long been isolated economically from the empire and which had its own system of local copper coinage. The
                  irregular use of AΛᵻOB on solidi of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justin_ii">Justin II</name> of Constantinopolitan fabric reveals a temporary gold production with
                  dies provided by <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</name>. Although the signature was corrected to the prescribed universal mark for gold,
                  CONOB, production seems to have lasted for some years, since it had to be sustained by locally cut dies of distinct style. These Alexandrian
                  solidi of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, which were differentiated from Constantinopolitan issues by other secret marks, might be
                  connected with the presence of the emperor's nephew <name type="pname">Justin</name> as augustalis of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> in 566. A similar situation, with a member of the imperial family being in charge of <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, occurred under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>, when
                  his cousin <name type="pname">Nicetas</name> had to fight the Persians and may have been short of money (616-18).<ref target="#CH1-n18"
                     >18</ref> The issue of solidi from Alexandria during the revolt of Heraclius (608-10), as proposed by <name type="pname">Grierson</name>,
                  is less secure.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There are two other groups of questionable attribution. One is of Carthaginian style and may belong to the special large-module series there
                  (see below).<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> The other shows the peculiar style of an itinerant military mint which also produced copper coins
                  with mint marks, first of Alexandria, then of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>. As <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name> was the proper base for military campaigns in the eastern Mediterranean basin, it is plausible that
                  it was the home of an extraordinary gold mint to meet military needs.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> The activity of this mint began under
                     Phocas<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> and continued with the unusual <pb n="10"/> consular solidi of the two Heraclii, which were
                  supplemented by fractional issues in the name of the deceased emperor <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>.
                  The solidi are marked with immobilized indictional or regnal dates or by a sequence of the letters I, IX, or IΠ, which may refer to a lustral
                  cycle.</p>
               <p>After <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>' coronation there were further issues, apparently for his Persian
                  campaigns. Their attribution to Cyprus and their dating (up into the 620s) are not universally accepted and other suggestions, such as
                  Alexandria or Jerusalem (from which we know copper coins from the siege of 614) have been made.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> The evidence of
                  provenance is of little help because the finds, which range from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> to <name
                     type="place">Turkey</name>, correlate with the extended theater of war.</p>

               <p>The second praetorian prefecture, <name type="place">Illyricum</name>, had its small gold mint at Thessalonica. Little can be added to <name

                  of Phocas will be elucidated by further discoveries.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> The fact that the output of this mint is estimated to be
                  small raises the question of the extent to which it was designed to meet the needs of the whole prefecture or whether it had only to serve a

                  were used from time to time; on the other hand, the mint showed relative independence in maintaining elements of older, out-of-date typology
                  at least until 562, when it was brought into line at the same time that the local copper currency system was abolished.</p>

               <p>The beginnings of gold coinage in the African prefecture from its creation in 534 to 578 are dealt with here by <name type="pname"
                     >Morrisson</name>. Before the Justinianic reconquest Carthage had never struck gold coins.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> It seems that the
                  Vandals possessed enough gold emanating from imperial mints that they could afford to respect the gold prerogative of the emperors. The new
                  Carthaginian gold mint was virtually a solidus mint, from which we know only a few fractional issues, struck for ceremonial purposes, from the
                  time of Heraclius onwards. The coins were normally dated by indictional years and sometimes by regnal years as well (under <name type="pname"
                     >Tiberius II</name> and <name type="pname">Maurice</name>). It is <pb n="11"/> now clear that the numerals on the early solidi of <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> are dates, not officina designations. The continuous dating enables us to
                  follow the curve of the output: its fluctuation, as <name type="pname">Morrisson</name> has recently shown, can be connected with lustral
                     taxation.<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> Technical considerations now explain the puzzling tendency to a globular fabric from the end of
                  the sixth century on: it obviated the need for hammering the blanks and speeded the process of striking, for less effort was required when
                  smaller blanks were used.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> The globular solidi are, however, accompanied by limited issues on larger flans, and
                  their deviation from the usual pattern and their accompaniment by rare fractions demonstrate their special ceremonial character.</p>
               <p>It can easily be supposed that the strange looking globular solidi would not easily have entered the circulating medium outside <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>, and in fact the evidence for external finds is scanty.<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref>
                  The African hoards have been carefully recorded by <name type="pname">Morrisson</name>, and to some extent these can be connected with
                  historical events. Especially for the last years of Byzantine domination, the coins provide new evidence: they even pinpoint the date of the
                  first Arab conquest of Carthage at the very end of 695.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> The splitting-off of the Sardinian branch mint
                  antedates this event,<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> but the circumstances remain uncertain.<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> Another study by
                     <name type="pname">Morrisson</name> has shown that there was a slight decrease in the weight of the African gold coins under Constans II
                  (642-68), but that the high fineness was retained until the end.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref>

                     rend="italic">magistri militum</hi> of the western empire had their own money supply during the second half of the fifth century. It was
                  only here that Odoacer could maintain a continued coinage in the name of the last western emperor, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_julius_nepos">Julius Nepos</name>,
                  whom <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_zeno">Zeno</name> demanded that he recognize in 476.<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Theodoric closed the Milan mint in the late 490s, perhaps as a result of his treaty with Anastasius I, in which imperial prerogatives were
                  newly defined.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref> The same fate befell Ravenna, a demonstration that the western court had ceased to exist. A
                  typological caesura in the Italian gold marks a new stage in the gradual assimilation to <name type="place">Constantinople</name> under
                     Theodoric.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> The <pb n="12"/> distribution of fifth-century solidi among the three Italian mints (and a fourth
                  at <name type="place">Arelate</name>) is fairly clear-cut, since most of them bear mint marks, but that of the unsigned fractions is more
                  problematic. Only the Milanese tremisses display a distinctive style.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> The differentiation between <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> and <name type="place">Ravenna</name> must rest on a close comparison of dies with those
                  of the mint marked silver pieces of small module. The lack of a monograph in this field is keenly felt. The reconstruction of the framework of
                  the fifth-century gold issues of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> will provide important insights into the
                  relationship between the eastern and western courts, inasmuch as the western mints struck a certain number of coins in the name of the eastern
                  emperor at times of mutual recognition.</p>
               <p>From about 500 onward the mint of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> was the only Italian <hi rend="italic">moneta
                     auri</hi> until Justinian's Gothic war once more involved Ravenna. While the Ostrogothic kings had to move their mint first to Ravenna
                  (536-40) and then to Ticinum (540-52), the Byzantines reorganized the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> mint in the newly
                  installed Italian prefecture, dividing it into ten officinae. This corresponds with the Constantinopolitan model.<ref target="#CH1-n38"
                     >38</ref> The mint soon followed the praetorian prefect to Ravenna as a consequence of the second siege of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> (545/6). The distinction between the Roman and the early Ravennate solidus issues is problematic.
                  Although the Roman pieces under Byzantine auspices started out with a clearly cut star of six rays—differentiating them from the eastern
                  solidi, which are marked with a star of eight rays—this characteristic disappears later in <name type="place">Ravenna</name>. Again the
                  comparison with the mint marked copper provides a guide. As activity decreased during the later part of Justinian's reign, the indication of
                  officinae became meaning less, and the letters in question seem to have become dates. The date at which this occurred and what kind of dating
                  was employed are still under discussion.<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> Even less is understood in the case of Tiberius II, when the western
                  authorities could not decide whether to count his years as Caesar or his years as Augustus.</p>
               <p>The contemporary gold coinage of the last three Ostrogothic kings—Hildebad, Totila/Baduila, and Theia—served mainly to pay their Frankish
                  auxiliaries, and therefore evoked Frankish imitations which are not always easily recognizable as such. In the last third of the sixth century
                  the Ravenna attributions need to be purged of similar coins which should be given to Sicily (see below). There are further difficulties in
                  sorting out the early Lombard imitations which also use the Ravenna model. In addition to the royal mint in Ticinum, several smaller workshops
                  of varying quality operated in the centers of the duchies.<ref target="#CH1-n40">40</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Rome's resumption of the striking of gold seems to coincide with Ravenna's growing isolation. The attributions in the earlier period (from
                     <name type="pname">Tiberius II</name> to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>) have hitherto been very
                     hypothetical,<ref target="#CH1-n41">41</ref> but from Constans II onward they become more coherent: at this time Rome's issues begin to
                  exceed those of Ravenna in quantity. From Constans II to Justinian II they show small monograms which probably refer to church treasuries or
                  to a magistrate who had something to do with coinage.<ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref> In any case there is no connection with the papal
                  monograms which made their appearance on the small silver coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> from the pontificate
                  of Constantine (708-15) onward.<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="13"/>
               <p>In the last three decades of the seventh century a third Italian gold mint emerges at the seat of the Neapolitan dukes. Among a group of more
                  or less imitative coins, its products are at first difficult to identify, but they become intelligible as soon as we can trace a sequence of
                  issues on which style and administrative marks can be seen to correlate.<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the eighth century the characteristic feature of the Italian coinage is its visible decline in weight and fineness. This has attracted the
                  application of newly developed or refined methods of metallurgical investigation: see the contribution of Oddy to this volume. In general a
                  short age of gold in the Mediterranean world accounts for its limited striking. The fluctuations in the gold content of the Rome coins, which
                  resulted in a temporary token coinage of copper solidi, are extremely puzzling. These coins can be dated precisely on the basis of a
                  continuous sequence of indictional years.<ref target="#CH1-n45">45</ref> The end of this old currency came with the Carolingian reform in
                     <name type="place">Italy</name> and with it the end of Byzantine hegemony over <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>. The latest Byzantine issue of copper solidi, as recognized by <name type="pname">R. Denk</name>,<ref
                     target="#CH1-n46">46</ref> dates from 777/8. The end of gold coinage in Ravenna had come a little earlier. After the Lombard conquest of
                  the city in 751, <name type="pname">King Aistwulf</name> continued to strike there in the exarch's mint,<ref target="#CH1-n47">47</ref> but
                  under Frankish pressure he lost the city to the Popes and with the departure of the court there was no longer any need to maintain a gold
                  mint. The differentiation between <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>, <name type="place">Ravenna</name> and <name
                     type="place" corresp="#viaf_3172394">Naples</name> under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo III</name> and Constantine V is
                  less difficult, because the very distinct style of Rome is also seen on the small silver coins with papal monograms mentioned above, and also
                  because a mint signature is occasionally used. On the other hand we can observe affinities between coins of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#viaf_3172394">Naples</name> and those of Beneventum, where the Lombard dukes are found striking coins with ducal monograms from
                  about 705 onward.<ref target="#CH1-n48">48</ref> Naples is the only Byzantine mint in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395"
                     >Italy</name> where a limited production has to be reckoned with after 800.<ref target="#CH1-n49">49</ref> The remnants of Byzantine
                  territory in <name type="place">southern Italy</name> were by now provided with coinage from Syracuse.</p>
               <p>Having dealt with the gold mints under regular administration, there remain attributions to possible mints with special status. Three
                  localities are considered: the <name type="place">Crimea</name> (Cherson), <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>
                  (Cartagena), and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> (Syracuse). Of these only the Spanish and the later Sicilian
                  attributions (after 640) are secure; the Chersonese and the earlier Sicilian attributions are affected by various uncertainties.</p>

               <p>At the opposite end of the Byzantine world, in the West, there was a military district on the Spanish coast which was loosely attached to the
                  African prefecture. Since this had been Visigothic territory and was surrounded by the Visigothic kingdom, where the tremissis was the only
                  denomination struck, a need for this denomination had to be met. Carthage did not supply them, since it was not a tremissis mint, and was in
                  any case remote. They were therefore manufactured locally from the beginning of the Byzantine presence under Justinian I (554) to its end
                  under Heraclius (615-24). They have a pronounced and peculiar style with reminiscences of Visigothic coins in their lettering and even
                  occasional typological borrowings. The evidence of provenance makes their attribution even more secure. Since the group was first identified

                  <hi rend="bold">SICILY</hi>
               </head>
               <p>By far the most important extraordinary gold mint was that of Sicily, which became the second most active mint in the empire from the later
                  seventh century onward. Until recently not only its beginnings but the entire first hundred years of its supposed existence were more or less
                  obscure. The spectacular Monte Judica hoard, presented in this volume, has shed new light on the early period of Sicilian gold coinage. The
                  position of this island had always been of exceptional importance, so it is hardly surprising to find that for a long time it was not subject
                  to the regular administration but was more directly controlled from <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. Whenever the money supply from
                  the capital was insufficient or its maintenance was considered inadvisable, a local mint had to serve as a substitute. Its products were not,
                  at first, intended to reveal their non-Constantinopolitan origin, and we have the same difficulties contemporaries must have had in
                  distinguishing them. This is, incidentally, also partially true of sixth-century copper from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily"
                     >Sicily</name>. Constantinopolitan as well as Ravennate stylistic influences hinder the attributions. While the attribution of Sicilian
                  solidi now seems secure throughout (with minor exceptions under Heraclius),<ref target="#CH1-n55">55</ref> the fractions offer serious
                  problems from Maurice into the first half of Heraclius' reign. A distinct group of them, which has been given tentatively to Sicily before
                  610, has recently been moved to Thessalonica without satisfactorily solving all the problems connected with this transfer.<ref
                     target="#CH1-n56">56</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Sicilian style proper and the use of specific administrative marks begins late in the reign of Heraclius. Occasional dating occurs under
                  Heraclius and Justinian II.<ref target="#CH1-n57">57</ref> The effect of the temporary <pb n="15"/> stay of Constans II in Syracuse (663-68)
                  on Sicilian coin production is still a matter of dispute: it is connected with the question of a traveling field mint accompanying the emperor
                  and with the supposed coinage of the usurper Mezezius in Sicily, the authenticity of which has been contested.<ref target="#CH1-n58">58</ref>
                  The weight was reduced by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</name> in his first reign (685-95) and again under
                  Philippicus (711-13) following the western tendency toward lower weight standards.<ref target="#CH1-n59">59</ref> The fineness fell during the
                  reign of Leontius (695-98) and after, but after some fluctuation it was stabilized by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo
                     III</name> in the 730s at a level about 15 percent lower than in <name type="pname">Constantinople</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n60">60</ref>
                  When the Arabs began their piecemeal occupation of the island (a process which extended from 827 to 878) and the Byzantine presence there
                  became more and more isolated, a final debasement in weight and fineness began which led to coins consisting of one half copper. The first
                  metallurgical investigations pioneered by the French team have shown the outlines, but more results are desirable to follow the development in
                  detail.</p>
               <p>This brief survey of the history of gold mints should make evident the need for further research. To understand the correlation between
                  monetary circulation and transactions new hoard registers are needed. Regional projects have been initiated to replace Mosser's outdated and
                  cursory bibliography of Byzantine hoards. Aside from the African inventory mentioned above, large scale efforts have been made to begin a
                  regional examination of all fifth to seventh-century hoards from the Balkans,<ref target="#CH1-n61">61</ref> with a view toward achieving a
                  better understanding of the Slavic incursions. Another attempt is underway in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>,<ref
                     target="#CH1-n62">62</ref> where smaller museums probably house unknown hoard material. All this work should be undertaken in light of new
                  attributions resulting from recent research. Unfortunately the eastern empire cannot be expected to receive similar coverage. We have to rely
                  on the occasional discovery of recently unearthed hoards, which rarely come from controlled excavations<ref target="#CH1-n63">63</ref> but are
                  mainly known through information from the trade. The dawning recognition of the importance of preserving provenances offers a faint ray of
                  hope. Several responsible dealers are to be thanked and encouraged for their efforts in this regard.</p>
               <p>A second approach to understanding the coinage is metrology in its broadest sense, which involves investigation not only of weight and
                  fineness, but of the exchange rates between metals — in other words, the price of gold expressed in copper or in kind (<hi rend="italic"
                     >adaeratio</hi>). Aspects of this question border on the territory of the economic historian, but the numismatic implications are primary,
                  since the coins themselves provide the evidence for monetary reforms or debasements as documented by the introduction of new denominations
                  such as the light weight solidus. Since <name type="pname">Adelson's</name> monograph on these peculiar coins of the sixth and seventh
                  centuries, much new <pb n="16"/> material has come to light,<ref target="#CH1-n64">64</ref> so that a new corpus of dies might be a promising
                  venture. Meanwhile we have been able to include in this volume a contribution devoted to one aspect of the subject, their distribution. The
                  importance of the light weight solidi for the reckoning of exchange rates has been argued in <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi>: they enabled the
                  payment of various sums in carats.</p>
               <p>The differentiation between coin units and units of account is a problem which has caused much confusion when related to contemporary texts.
                  Two examples recently discussed in the light of exchange rates (i.e. solidus prices) are the Abydos inscription and the Donori
                     inscription.<ref target="#CH1-n65">65</ref> Both give insights into Byzantine taxation policies. Similar problems are encountered when the
                  numerous references to payments recorded in papyri are used for numismatic analysis.<ref target="#CH1-n66">66</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It has been supposed that the output of the mints was dictated in advance by the authorities of the tax administration, in close connection
                  with taxation policies. This would imply that the volume of an issue was calculated by the expected demands, an idea that has not gone
                     unchallenged.<ref target="#CH1-n67">67</ref> Where the solidi are dated by years, we should be able to check the fluctuations in mint
                  activity as soon as we have calculated more reliable estimates of output through die corpora. A comparison with fiscal periods such as
                  taxation cycles and census terms might also provide new insights.<ref target="#CH1-n68">68</ref> The financing of the <hi rend="italic"
                     >augustaticum</hi>, which was to be paid by the emperor to his soldiers on his quinquennial anniversaries, must have been burdensome, since
                  Anastasius I had abolished the <hi rend="italic">collatio lustralis auri argentive in 498</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n69">69</ref> Raising of such
                  large sums seems to have been facilitated by monetary measures, such as altering exchange rates from time to time.<ref target="#CH1-n70"
                     >70</ref> In any case, the economic situation of the empire will be elucidated by better knowledge of the quantities of gold needed in
                  circulation to support taxation on the one hand and, on the other, for the payment of troops, civil servants, subsidies, and tributes. A new
                  compilation of the limited evidence referring to such budget figures would be useful and would facilitate reference to complementary
                     evidence.<ref target="#CH1-n71">71</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="17"/>
               <p>As always, new questions may seem to retard the progress of numismatic research. The authors and editors of this volume have not hesitated to
                  advance their ideas and speculations; nor have they concealed their feelings whenever the assembled numismatic material seemed insufficient to
                  solve inherent problems. Although they differ in their style of presentation, they hope that their comments on the numismatic evidence (of
                  which, it is hoped, some will endure) will be noticed by historians.</p>

            <p>In the spring of 527, <name type="pname">Justin I</name>, who had ruled for nine years, fell ill; on April 1, under pressure from the Senate, he
               co-opted <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, whose career he had been promoting since his own accession. Three days later, on Easter Sunday,
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> was crowned by the Patriarch Epiphanios; that this event occured in the
               Delphax rather than, as usual, in the Hippodrome, bespeaks the gravity of <name type="pname">Justin's</name> illness. The old emperor (he was 75
               or 77) finally succumbdd on August 1.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The gold coinage of the brief joint reign of <name type="pname">Justin</name> and <name type="pname">Justinian</name> has attracted little
               systematic study despite its obvious allure.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> The elegant presentation of two enthroned emperors on the obverse
               stands out against the otherwise bleak background of the sixth-century gold: moreover, the very brevity of the reign and the rarity of the coins
               render them a controllable mass and insure that a high percentage of the population surviving above ground is either preserved in major
               collections or illustrated in sale catalogues.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Alfred Bellinger</name>, who made no attempt at comprehensiveness, was able to assemble a corpus of
               33 specimens in 1966; less than a decade later <name type="pname">W. Hahn</name> increased the number of recorded specimens to 40, and to 45 by
                  1981.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> Neither made a systematic study of the dies, although both attemped to classify the bewildering variety of
               obverse variants and obverse/reverse combinations in trying to educe a structure for the coinage. The purpose of this essay is to present a
               fuller listing and an ordered catalogue of the coins incorporating its extensive die linkage. It is not claimed that a rational structure can be
               perceived, and indeed it is plausible that that system, if any, would elude detection even if all the coinage survived to us. But it is possible
               to take the evidence somewhat further than either <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</name> or <name type="pname">Hahn</name>
               was able to do and, if one can generalize from the experience of a relatively brief episode in the early history of the solidus, to suggest some
               flaws in the way we now look at imperial mint organization.</p>

                  romanized for convenience. For varieties of his groups I and II, the obverse dies are prefixed "O" and numbered serially in order of

                  III, the obverses are prefixed "C" (curved); reverses continue the numbering of groups I and II. <pb n="20"/> Weights are given where known,
                  merely for the sake of completeness, since the weights approach the normative 4.5 g; the dies seem to be oriented at 6:00 without variation.

               </head>
               <p>In the catalogue, the obverse dies are presented in increasing order of complexity of the type and within the major headings according to
                  adjuncts. This preserves the essence of <name type="pname">Hahn's</name> system, which is based on the shape of the throne, the presence or
                  absence of a cross, and presence or absence of a globe. These are by no means the only diagnostics that might have been chosen. <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</name>, who first drew attention to the varieties of throne type, also noted that the
                  presentation of the imperial figures is not consistent throughout: either may have either knee advanced, and it may be the same as or opposite
                  to that of his partner. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</name> noticed the differences in obverse legend that are
                  observed here without, apparently, attaching any significance to them; <name type="pname">Hahn</name> ignored the legends entirely. The
                  presence or absence of a cross has elicited no detailed comment.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> After a lengthy discussion of such variations in
                  the obverses, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</name> concluded that they are not the idiosyncrasies of die engravers and
                  that the divergencies are not demonstrably connected. He remarked, "We can only conclude that a number of engravers, working in a hurry,
                  produced dies which conformed in general, to be sure, but which were not strictly controlled as to details."<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref> The
                  "hurry" factor is often associated with short reigns, but except insofar as we suppose a pressure for immediate coinage at an imperial
                  accession, <name type="pname">Grierson</name> is quite right to remark that short reigns are only short in retrospect, and that contemporaries
                  could hardly have foreseen their brief duration.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Yet within this broad context of supposed haste and consequent jumbling of attributes, some aspects of the types have been thought
                  significant. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</name>, for example, supported Wroth's distinction between styles 1 and 2,
                  the former characterized by clasped hands, the latter by the left holding a globus. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084"
                     >Bellinger</name> remarks, "One hesitates to speak of a sequence of issues in a period of only four months but it may be suggested that the
                  superior majesty of Type 2 was felt <pb n="24"/> to be more appropriate than the superior piety of Type l."<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Hahn's</name> discussion is brief and, in part, derivative from <name type="pname">Bellinger's</name>. Like <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</name> he sees chronological significance in the shift from folded arms to globus in left;
                  and for him the variable seating arrangements (no throne/throne/lyre-backed throne) are the hallmarks of three different die engraves..</p>
               <p>None of this will withstand examination. <name type="pname">Hahn's</name> own observation of the frequent linkage among obverse types, further
                  elaborated here, disposes of any chronological significance they might be supposed to have, since no consistent pattern emerges. Note, for
                  example, the following shared reverses:</p>
               <p>B1: groups Ia and Ic</p>
               <p>B2: groups Id and IIc</p>
               <p>Γ1: groups Id and IIa</p>
               <p>Δ1: groups Ia and Id</p>
               <p>Z2: groups IIa and IIc</p>
               <p>⊖1: groups Id and IIa</p>
               <p>I1: groups Ib and Id</p>
               <p>Dies paired with obverses of group Id are those most commonly linked with obverses of other groups, but by any measure that is the most common
                  variety in the series and its linkage to the others would be expected to be most frequent. No single attribute or adjunct appears with
                  sufficient consistency among the groups to be taken as a chronological signpost unless we suppose the simultaneous striking of three very
                  different obverse styles; in that case we would be reduced to discussing nothing more than the relationship of the dies inter se, a bootless
                  endeavor. What may be significant—though not necessarily in chronological terms—is the elaboration of the throne.</p>
               <p>The most elaborate of the thrones that appear on the coinage of the joint reign is commonly called "lyre-backed," for obvious reasons. Until
                  the study of Cutler in 1975,<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> this form had attracted hardly any attention at all, perhaps because its
                  representation is confined to coins. In a study of the appearance of the motif he concluded, largely from overwhelming ex silentio arguments,
                  that there is no evidence for the existence of the lyre-backed throne as a piece of furniture, and that its significance is therefore to be
                  sought in its symbolism. To summarize broadly (and without considering its possible orphic origins and implications), this throne may be seen
                  as the medium by which the Logos, through intermediaries, harmonized the conflicts of the world. It originally had the connotation of wisdom,
                  but this was eventually forgotten and the form degenerated so far as to become virtually unrecognizable.</p>
               <p>This interpretation is certainly consistent with the coins of the joint reign, both politically and numismatically. The association of <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> in the rule was clearly intended to formalize his succession to the elderly
                  emperor, who was either 75 or 77 years old at the beginning of 527. The coinage, like the events of Holy Week, simply confirmed a longstanding
                  dynastic plan that would be the signal achievement of <name type="pname">Justin's</name> rule.</p>
               <p>The view that the type is to be read only in such broad terms is reinforced by the casual admixture of other symbolic forms—globe and cross as
                  attributes and adjuncts—as well as inattention to sometimes die-specific variants in legends meant to be perceived as formulaic, quite apart
                  from the information they conveyed.<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref>

                  <p>The cross which usually appears between the heads of the emperors on the obverse was called by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084"
                        >Bellinger</name> a cross potent, but if it is properly potent at all the termini of the cross are attenuated at best. This
                     identification of the cross led <name type="pname">A. Cutler</name>, "The Lyre-backed Throne," <hi rend="italic">Transfigurations: Studies
                        in the Dynamics of Byzantine Iconography</hi> (Pennsylvania State University Press, <name type="place">University Park</name>, 1975) to
                     observe that the use of the cross potent during the reigns of <name type="pname">Justin</name> and <name type="pname">Justinian</name>
                     seems to be confined to the coins; but while there are clear examples in the coinage of Justinian alone, the joint reign solidi are not the
                     best evidence for the phenomenon.</p>

                  <p>The omission of AN from the obverse of O8 is unique, as are the disconnected Ns of O18. It would be easier to take IVSTINAN as a simple

                     a single time (C1) in class III, while that class's dominant fuller form occurs once in class II (O22). It should be recognized that such
                     variations, which are often useful and used in cataloguing, may bear no relation to mint organization.</p>

                  ornament surmounting the cross in the angel's right hand. A quick survey of the coins of the flanking reigns of <name type="pname">Justin
                     I</name> and of Justinian I seems to suggest that the reverses of the joint reign owe more to their predecessors struck under Justin than
                  the coins of Justinian do to either in terms of style: by comparison, the coins of Justinian show a generally more squat angel whose wings do
                  not rise as high vis × vis his head: the drapery is rendered with less care, and the placement of the feet often suggests a figure in motion
                  rather than static.</p>
               <p>It is possible—in fact, likely—that some reverse dies of <name type="pname">Justin</name> and <name type="pname">Justinian</name> were
                  originally employed during the sole reign of <name type="pname">Justin</name>, and that some continued in use when <name type="pname"
                     >Justinian</name> achieved sole power in August of 527. A careful search would be tedious but would probably repay the effort. It has not
                  been undertaken here because unless such links were to be found in numbers they would not significantly alter the picture of the coinage
                  suggested here. What is needed is a more refined view of the internal chronology of the coinage than is possible in the present state of the
                  evidence.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The careful marking of reverse dies in the Byzantine coinage seems to attest the most rigid subdivision into officinae observed in any ancient
                  coinage. Although the internal structure of the mint is not perfectly understood, it is at least clear that the concept of discrete,
                  independently functioning workshops is to be avoided. This was first observed by <name type="pname">Grierson</name>, and has subsequently been
                  reinforced by the occasional occurence of die linked solidi of different officinae in hoards.<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Here the instance of dies shared among officinae must surely be as high as is to be observed in any sample of Byzantine coins. Die O1 is found
                  with reverse dies from B (1) Δ (2), and H (3a-b); O5 with B (8a-b), Δ (10a-b), S (13), ⊖ (22), and I (24a-b, 25); O6 with Γ (9a-b) and S (16);
                  O8 with E, S, ⊖, and I (12, 17, 23a-b, 26a-c), and so on. In the present sample there is no evidence of a systematic association of pairs or
                  triplets of officinae, and it has to be supposed that the distribution of dies among the workshops reflects their drawing upon a common pool
                  of dies (a die box) for the production of reverses. It is of course equally plausible that the obverses, too, came from die boxes, since there
                  is nothing which would suggest their attachment to specific officinae, and indeed the likelihood of this construct grows as obverses begin to
                  appear linked with dies of three or more workshops.</p>
               <p>In spite of the small size of the sample, it may be worthy of note that there is no certain instance of recutting of dies to be observed,
                  either within or among officinae and despite the existence of die <graphic url="NS17_sym1.jpg"/>3 with the number reversed.<ref

               </head>
               <p>Heretofore it has never been supposed that these coins were struck anywhere but <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. There is clear
                  evidence for the existence of a mint for gold at Thessalonica for the emperors <pb n="26"/> from Anastasius I onwards—sometimes gold that
                  would on the basis of its markings have been taken to be Constantinopolitan—but no one to date has hinted at the existence of a
                  non-metropolitan mint for the brief joint reign.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In fact if Cutler's analysis is credited and the throne is stripped of its pictorial literalism, and if this is combined with the discreteness
                  of the lyre-backed group, it is possible, at least for now, to suggest the existence of a mint at Thessalonica. For none of the lyre-backed
                  solidi display reverse die links to throneless or square-backed ones, while within those two groups die linkage is common.</p>
               <p>It is dangerous to be dogmatic in enumerating stylistic differences on the basis of as few as seven specimens from five obverse dies but, for
                  what it is worth, the obverses of group III generally display taller, more vertically oriented figures seated on the throne, which is itself
                  rendered with more care and consistency than those shown on the coins with straight back of group II. The angel on the reverse maintains the
                  same posture throughout, and his right wrist leading up to the cross is impossibly long. The star in the field is uniformly large, while some
                  variation in size is to be observed on coins of the other two groups. Against the use of style as a dissociative criterion are certain
                  features which, if not identical, at least display the same kind of variation as has been noted in groups I and II: for example, on obverse
                  die C1 the outside knees of both emperors are advanced, while on all the other dies the right ones are forward; C1 also lacks the cross in
                  field which is present on all other dies. Similarly C1 is without the globe, which is present elsewhere, and it has short form of obverse
                  legend which is characteristic of groups I and II. I have not been able to examine the coins struck from this die, but just possibly the
                  lyre-backed throne has been recut from a rectilinear one. If so, the hypothesis of a second mint is obviously weakened.</p>

               </head>
               <p>At the very least the picture of the coinage of <name type="pname">Justin I</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i"
                     >Justinian I</name> is more complicated than expected. <name type="pname">Grierson</name> had already pointed to the fairly frequent
                  linkage among officinae, which is more common than the existence of a system for their numeration would imply; his view is confirmed here,
                  with its implications extended into the sixth century. Similarly minor variations in legend and in distribution of attributes and adjuncts
                  cannot be seen here—as they are sometimes seen elsewhere—as the trademarks of engravers or as secret marks that somehow, if decoded, might
                  elucidate the working routine of the metropolitan mint.</p>
               <p>Allowance must be made for the "hurry factor"; even if "short reigns are only short in retrospect," the illness of <name type="pname"
                     >Justin</name> gave more than the usual urgency to a proclamation coinage, and this might be reflected in unusual steps taken to hasten its
                  production. Nonetheless, the coinage presents a surprisingly disorganized aspect which, if it may be generalized to the sixth century coinage
                  at large, reduces the reliability of some time-honored simple solutions to complex problems, and invites the painstaking analysis, die by die,
                  of a forbidding mass of material.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A die study of this sort provides the opportunity to estimate the numer of dies used for this coinage from the number represented in the
                  surviving sample. Any number of methods have <pb n="27"/> been devised for this calculation, but the formula applied here is that of
                  Carter,</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-2">
                  <graphic url="NS17_024a.jpg"/>

               </figure>
               <p>where n = 2 to 3d.<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Six specimens (4, 18, 29-30, 41, and 43) have been omitted from the calculations since no photographs are available, leaving a total of 73
                  pieces from 37 reverses dies. For the obverses, two calculations must be made because of uncertainty regarding the identity of the obverse of
                  coin 48: the first assumes that it is identical to another known obverse, the second assumes that it is not, so d<hi rend="sup">1</hi> = 32
                  and d<hi rend="sup">2</hi> = 33 obverses. Carter's formulae yield the following results: 1) projects an estimate of 47 × 4 obverse dies, 2) 50
                  × 5 obverse dies, while both yield an estimate of 61 × 7 reverse dies. Since these two calculations embrace the whole coinage, including two
                  bodies of material that are immiscible (groups I and II do not and, in the case of the obverses, cannot share dies with group III) it is
                  perhaps sounder methodologically to provide a separate calculation for groups I and II only: thus from 65 coins with 1) 27 or 2) 28 obverse
                  dies, and 32 reverse dies, the results are as follows: 1) 38 × 4, 2) 41 × 4 obverses, and 51 × 6 reverses. Adding these projections to the
                  actual number of dies observed for group III (which is too small to apply the method meaningfully) produces satisfactory consistency. An
                  estimate of the total original die population at ca. 50 obverses and 60 reverses will not be far from the truth.</p>
               <p>The joint reign lasted only 17 weeks, and there is no reason to suppose that the coinage began before it or continued after it. Even in this
                  period, which might well have been one of heavy coinage in view of the imperial accession, somewhat less than an obverse a day was used if the
                  work week consisted of five days.</p>

            <p>Some ten years ago on Monte Judica in the province Catania, Sicily, a hoard of sixth-century gold coins appeared. This hoard is essential for
               understanding the activities of the smaller Byzantine gold mints in the western half of the empire and is comparable only to the 1948
               Thessalonica hoard's materials for mint attributions in the East. The coins had been concealed in an unglazed terracotta pot which, regrettably,
               has since been lost. The hoard was immediately split up, and some of the coins were dispersed in trade via <name type="place"

                  <p>As can be seen from this summary there is a Sicilian gold coinage which can be traced back to <name type="pname"
                        corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> and indeed (as shall be shown) almost to the time of the reconquest of the island by
                     the imperial forces. During the course of the Ostrogothic war Belisarius captured Sicily after a six month campaign from July to December
                     535 (Procop. <hi rend="italic">Goth</hi> 5.5) and a Byzantine administration was installed in 537 (Novels 104). Sicily was given special
                     status as it was not subject to one of the neighboring prefectures, but was governed by a <hi rend="italic">praetor</hi> under the direct
                     control of the <hi rend="italic">quaestor sacri palatii</hi> in <name type="place">Constantinople</name>: the province was administered <hi
                        rend="italic">quasi peculiare aliquid commodum imperatoribus.</hi> Under these extraordinary circumstances it appears that the monetary
                     supply of the island was provided either directly by <name type="place">Constantinople</name> or by an exceptional branch mint <pb n="33"/>
                     under Constantinople's control, and for the seventh century there is evidence for both practices.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the sixth century, however, the identification of Sicilian coins has been slow until now. The only clues have been stylistic
                     comparisons and provenances, since the gold coins in question do not betray their non-Constantinopolitan origin by any kind of signature.
                     Even the Sicilian coppers do not have their own mint marks until the 580s. Before the Monte Judica hoard appeared, the starting point of
                     the Sicilian series was the partly mint marked copper coinage of Maurice. The most recent contributions to the subject sought to establish
                     Sicilian gold attributions for as early as Tiberius II.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> Now we can move back the dating into the reigns of the
                     two preceding emperors, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> and <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, by
                     reference to a number of unusual coins in this hoard which are of a fabric previously unrecognized or misattributed. The recognition of
                     this fabric is made more difficult by its similarity to coins of Ravenna fabric of the later sixth century. The Monte Judica hoard, then,
                     provides welcome corrections to the distinctions between Sicilian and Ravenna gold coinage. It has implications also for the copper, for
                     which there are similar difficulties in the earlier part of the period of Byzantine domination.</p>
                  <p>The composition of the Monte Judica hoard is characteristic of an accumulation in a region where a provincial mint with limited output was
                     operating. Only among the coins of the last years before the hoarding was completed do the local issues outnumber those of
                        Constantinople,<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> and die links occur only among the provincial issues of the local mint. The chronological
                     pattern is normal and coins issued in the years not long before the date of deposit are represented in larger numbers in the hoard. In
                     addition to Constantinopolitan coins the hoard contains examples from almost all the provincial mints. Their numbers reflect their
                     proximity to Sicily: Thessalonica and Carthage are represented by only two coins each, whereas the Italian mints, first <name type="place"
                        corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> and later <name type="place">Ravenna</name>, are represented by 12 pieces.</p>
                  <p>The attribution of the non-Sicilian provincial gold of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> and <name
                        type="pname">Justin II</name> has been firmly established by modern numismatic research. Nevertheless one expects new material to bring
                     forward novelties. The Roman solidus 63 is remarkable for its lack of a star in the right reverse field. Possibly this is no more than an
                     engraver's error, but the same omission on a tremissis of approximately the same date, <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 2, pl. 38, N36, is
                     perhaps no coincidence.</p>
                  <p>The most important contribution of the Monte Judica hoard is the group of 19 unusual coins of <name type="pname"
                        corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name>, 71-75, and <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, 85-98. To show the Sicilian origin of
                     the group one has to argue from the latest part of the hoard, where the local coins have their strongest representation. There are nine
                     solidi of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, 85-93, having a fabric not known before and variously die linked among themselves. Certain
                     features, especially the bulging rim, recall the Ravenna style; but, on closer examination, the emperor's bust is somewhat different from
                     that of the well known Ravenna pieces (compare with 83 and 84). Moreover the terminal letter of the reverse legend, which gives a sequence
                     of B, Γ, Δ, and Є on the new coins, is not otherwise attested on the Ravenna solidi of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, apart from the
                     problematical <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 3, V20 with Δ, discussed below. There can be little doubt that these letters stand for dates, for
                     the local mint was certainly too small to consist of five officinae. Furthermore the preponderance of Δ coins, the last year but one, is
                     typical of a chronological sequence, while the last year, Є, is less heavily represented. The die links among solidi 85-93 indicate a high
                     survival rate from almost certainly a very small number of dies and an obverse die is carried from one year to the next in two cases, while
                     another skips year three.</p>

                  <p>The question of what kind of dates are concerned is easily resolved in favor of indictional years, because the solidi of the first two
                     regnal years of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> should have had the star of the old indiction which ended in 567. This starred first
                     emission of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, known from <name type="place">Constantinople</name> (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 1), is not
                     found in the hoard, and the Constantinople portion drops during the later years (there are only five solidi of <name type="pname">Justin
                        II</name> from the metropolitan mint). Using indictional dates, the Sicilian solidi 85-93 can be assigned to years 568-72; the latest
                     coin in the hoard therefore was minted before 1 September 572. The appearence of dated solidi in the early years of the 567-78 indiction
                     has parallels, incidentally, at Carthage, and there were also experiments made with dated solidi in <name type="place"
                        >Constantinople</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>In addition to the solidi, the hoard also has fractional coins of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> belonging to the local mint. There
                     are four tremisses (95-98) and one semissis (94) of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> as well as one tremissis of <name type="pname"
                        corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> (75), of a fabric that was already known and that had been attributed to Ravenna
                        (<name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name>, <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 40.1 and 41.1, and <name type="pname"
                        >Justin II</name>, <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 24), where two stylistic groups were recognized. This was explained by postulating two
                     engravers. Now the problem is resolved by the recognition of two different mints, <name type="place">Ravenna</name> and <name type="place"
                        corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> (See "Comparative Material," Plates 7 and 8). The stylistic relation between them is similar to
                     that seen in the solidi: they share the bulging rim, but the obverse bust has some differences in its appearence, especially in the drawing
                     of the folds of the paludamentum on the emperor's chest. Furthermore the Ravenna star is a little larger and often six-rayed; on the
                     semisses it is missing altogether. As well as the coins in the Monte Judica hoard there are several other specimens which also belong to
                     this newly recognized Sicilian fabric: there are four more semisses and one tremissis of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>.</p>

                  <p>The semisses 128-29 are of special interest, because they have the letter Δ at the end of the reverse legend. This could be a date
                     corresponding with that on solidi 88-92; but one wonders whether it is because the semisses of the other years were in fact not marked with
                     a date, and <pb n="35"/> other expected varieties are not in the hoard. It is tempting to dismiss the interpretation of Δ as year 4, and
                     instead to connect the semisses 128-29 with another problematic coin, the solidus <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 3, pl. 56, V20, which is
                     recorded there together with semissis 128 (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 24b) under Ravenna. Of this solidus there are two specimens.</p>

                  <p>They have the star of the old indiction in the left of the reverse field and can therefore be dated 565-67. Although the Δ is apparently
                     meaningless, it may have been copied (immobilized) from earlier Sicilian solidi, see 72-74 of <name type="pname"
                        corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name>. Stylistically 126 and 127 stand between these and the Sicilian solidi of <name
                        type="pname">Justin II</name>, 88-92. A further clue to the Sicilian attribution of the star issue is perhaps to be found in the
                     tremissis 130 which has the star also to the left, as a consequence of which Victory has been shown with the globus cruciger and wreath
                     reversed. This seems not to be an engraver's error, because the head looks left as on tremissis 95 in the Monte Judica hoard. As the
                     obverse of 130 is very similar to that of the Δ semisses 128-29, it probably completes the series of denominations in gold for 565-67.</p>
                  <p>The reattribution of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> V20 to Sicily makes the recent suggestions as to the meaning of the terminal letters Z and
                     P on the Ravenna solidi<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref> untenable, especially since the presence of both in this hoard, 83-84, dates the
                     change from Z to P before 572. The earlier explanation of these letters as pseudo-officinae<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> remains preferable
                     for Ravenna.</p>
                  <p>Returning to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name>, the Sicilian group within the hoard is represented by
                     four solidi and one tremissis. Tremissis 76 offers no problems, being closely related in style to its successors under <name type="pname"
                        >Justin II</name>. More of Justinian's tremisses and semisses of this fabric are known from several sources and need to be removed from

                  <p>This second specimen is undoubtedly of the same fabric as 67-70 of the Monte Judica hoard, but it has two terminal letters in the reverse
                     legend, A⊖, where the others have Γ (67) or Δ (68-70), and the star is in the left reverse field instead of its normal position on the
                     right. The sequence and the dating of these three varieties depend on the interpretation of the letters Γ, Δ, and A⊖. The succeeding issue,
                     126-27 of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, has the Δ as well as the star left of the A⊖ issue. The solution might be sought from the

                  <p>If the year 30 is a real one (which does not seem improbable) the Δ could be an indictional year, as the signature of a fourth officina
                     would be only a pseudo-officina letter to fill the space. A fourth indictional year ended on 31 August 556, and the thirteenth regnal year
                     began on 1 April 556. The Δ on the solidi could refer to the same indictional year; the Γ would then be the year before (554/5), but what
                     is A⊖? It is even uncertain whether we should read ⊖ or a vertical Φ; AΦ makes no obvious sense,<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> while ⊖
                     could be the date, elucidated by A as year 9, or perhaps the date is expressed by the A, equalling 1, and the ⊖ is a separate
                     administrative (secret) mark as occurs so often in the seventh century.<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> The first year of this indiction was
                     552/3, and the ninth year was 560/1. Both are possible and the question cannot be resolved on the basis of current knowledge.</p>
                  <p>There is another coin in the hoard displaying two letters at the end of the reverse inscription, 54 with IB, well known from a number of
                     other specimens and previously thought to be a product of a twelfth officina in the Constantinople mint.<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref>
                     This explanation was based on the assumption that the opening of the Carthaginian gold mint in about 540 was done by two newly created
                     officinae of the metropolitan mint which applied the marks IA and IB. These solidi stylistically <pb n="37"/> developed into the locally
                     identifiable Carthaginian issues similar to the standard type struck between 537 and 542 in <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. After
                     a while the twelfth officina was thought to have been returned to Constantinople and to have been active striking solidi of the type
                     introduced in 542 until its dissolution somewhat later. This hypothesis is apparently invalid, as <name type="pname">C. Morrisson</name>
                     has argued convincingly that the <hi rend="bold">IA</hi> and <hi rend="bold">IB</hi> of the Carthaginian solidi are indictional years.<ref
                        target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> The IB marked coins of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 7 are certainly of Constantinopolitan fabric, and if they
                     belong to a twelfth officina, we have no sign of an eleventh which may have been the silver officina not marking its products.</p>

                     <graphic url="NS17_033.jpg"/>
                  </figure>
                  <p>The situation is complicated even more by the recent appearance of a single solidus marked IЄ at the end of the reverse legend and of
                     undeniably Constantinopolitan style. On this coin the Є was probably added to an already finished die of the tenth officina because there
                     was no space left after the I and the Є, therefore, had to be cut over the exergual line. It is difficult to explain the combinations IB
                     and IЄ in the metropolitan mint. <name type="pname">J. P. C. Kent</name> has suggested cooperation between two officinae in the somewhat
                     similar case of the 22 carat, light weight solidi with ⊖S,<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref> but the question remains, why or under which
                     conditions would they have cooperated. An early experiment to introduce indictional dating on the regular Constantinopolitan solidi is
                     improbable because of the gap between the years 12 and 15. The assumption of indictional years would perhaps be more plausible, if the
                     coins were struck in <name type="place">Constantinople</name> but intended for a western destination, e.g. for Sicily. In this case the IB
                     would stand for 548/9, because IЄ can only be 551/2 (the fifteenth year of the next indiction being later than the end of Justinian's
                     reign). Although there is no further evidence for a Sicilian connection for these coins apart from the single example in the Monte Judica
                        hoard,<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref> it is tempting to see them as a preliminary stage in the development of Sicilian gold coinage. The
                     years 12 (548/9) and 15 (551/2) would have been provided by <name type="place">Constantinople</name>, whereas the later years 3 (554/5), 4
                     (555/6), and 9 (560/1) or 1 (552/3) could have been struck in Sicily itself. The use of indictional datings on coins which might have been
                     produced in the Constantinople mint for circulation in the West is also notable on the copper issue of 553/4 (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi>
                     98).</p>
                  <p>The wreath border on the reverse of follis 101 leads us to the question of the hitherto very uncertain origin of the numerous western 10-
                     and 5-nummi pieces with the Latin value mark X (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 244) and V (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 246). <name type="pname"
                        >Hahn</name> proposed a Sicilian mint for them<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref> despite the absence of any solid evidence. Their drawing
                     of the emperor's profile bust is often somewhat crude, but there are pieces (123-25) which are stylistically comparable to the fractional
                     gold coins. The comparison seems to strengthen the Sicilian attribution of the coppers, especially the delineation of the hair <graphic
                        url="NS17_sym6.jpg"/>. The Monte Judica hoard thus offers more evidence for the production of copper coins in Sicily under <name
                        type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name>. In its later development, i.e. in the later years of <name type="pname"
                        corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> and under <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, further stylistic comparisions do not
                     help, because the dies of the copper coins tend to become too crude for similarities to be detected. More hoards providing such evidence
                     are needed to solve the remaining problems.</p>
                  <pb n="38"/>
                  <p>Due to the indictional dates on the Sicilian solidi of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, the concealment of the Monte Judica hoard must
                     have been in 572 or shortly afterward. We know of no threat to Sicily in these years. The last incursion had been made 20 years earlier by
                     the <name type="pname">Totilas Goths</name>, while the Lombards had not yet reached the straits of Messina.</p>
                  <p>The value of the hoard amounts to 93 1/8 solidi, i.e. about 1 1/8 pounds of gold, almost exactly corresponding to that of Thessaloniki
                     hoard of 1948 which amounted to 93 1/8 solidi. Compared with the payments and rents mentioned in the letters of <name type="pname">Pope
                        Gregory I</name> (590-604) referring to Sicily<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref> this was a small fortune. Is it possible that there was a
                     Jewish community there as there were in several other Sicilian cities of this time?<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref> Such communities were
                     often harrassed by church authorities.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref> In addition, 572, the probable year the hoard was closed, was the end
                     of a lustrum, i. e. the end of a taxation period.</p>

                     Judica hoard, i.e. after 572 and before the reorganization of the monetary supply under Heraclius and Constans II. What is known from the
                     time of Tiberius II onwards is summarized in two articles by <name type="pname">W. R. O. Hahn</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n22">22</ref> A
                     single tremissis of Tiberius II has survived (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 3, pl. 56, N14). There are five tremisses of Maurice (<hi
                        rend="italic">MIB</hi> 26) and, late in his reign, six solidi (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 28) and one light weight solidus of 20 carats
                        (<hi rend="italic">M1B</hi> 29). Both rulers resumed dating by indictional years. Phocas follows with similar solidi (<hi rend="italic"
                        >MIB</hi> 97 and 98, three specimens recorded), semisses (three specimens),<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref> and tremisses (<hi
                        rend="italic">MIB</hi> 99 and 100, eleven <pb n="39"/> specimens recorded). Under Heraclius the pattern is completed by a semissis (<hi
                        rend="italic">MIB</hi> V99, one specimen recorded) together with solidi (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 97 and 98, three specimens recorded)
                     and tremisses (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 99 and 100, eleven specimens recorded). Then there seems to have been a break in the coinage,
                     perhaps sometime in the early twenties. When coining resumed in the thirties,<ref target="#CH3-n24">24</ref> the coins were of a different
                     fabric which developed into the characteristic Sicilian style well known from the time of Constans II onward.</p>
                  <p>During the entire period between <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and Heraclius Sicilian gold mintage was restricted to a small output
                     apparently meeting only a part of the demands of the administration. This is obvious from the frequent die linkage and the small numbers of
                     surviving specimens as well as from the predominantly Constantinopolitan composition of the few Sicilian gold hoards up to the middle of
                     the seventh century.<ref target="#CH3-n25">25</ref> The Monte Judica hoard is somewhat exceptional insofar as it contains a relatively

            <p>As long ago as 1956, <name type="pname">J. P. C. Kent</name>
               <ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> analyzed the concentration of the striking of gold, following the Valentinianic reforms of 368,<ref
                  target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> in the care of the <hi rend="italic">comitatus</hi> and the Palatine <hi rend="italic">officium</hi> or, insofar as
               the East was concerned, essentially at <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. Nonetheless the existence of a number of issues from Theodosius
               II through Basiliscus,<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> doubtless struck at Thessalonica, as well as the Byzantine series known from <name
                  type="place">Ravenna</name> in the sixth century, led him to postulate an association between the mintage of gold and the prefectures of <name
                  type="place">Illyricum</name> and of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>. It was thus logical to conclude that, like
               Ravenna, Carthage, as the seat of the prefecture of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>, would probably have received a
               Palatine detachment of the <hi rend="italic">officium</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">comes sacrum largitionum</hi> for that purpose after its
               reconquest under Justinian.<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The correctness of this hypothesis was confirmed some years later, after the acquisition by the Cabinet des Médailles of a solidus with the mark
               ΛΦP(ıkη) on the reverse. <name type="pname">J. Lafaurie</name> identified, on the basis of this exceptional exergue, a series of specimens of the
               same style with the normal marks <hi rend="bold">CONOB</hi> and <hi rend="bold">IA, IB,</hi> or IΓ at the end of the reverse legend, which had
               previously been confused with issues of <name type="place">Constantinople</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> The North African origin of
               certain pieces further supported this attribution,<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> which was immediately accepted and supplemented in <hi
                  rend="italic">DOC</hi> (1966) by the identification, on stylistic grounds, of solidi with Γ<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref> and ⊖.<ref
                  target="#CH4-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The criteria adduced for this distinction are rarely defined with precision, and for good reason. Under <name type="pname">Justinian</name>,
               contrary to what one observes under <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and <name type="pname">Tiberius II</name>, there is no particular
               iconographic difference between the coinage of the province and that of the capital. Most of the solidi have on the obverse three pellets on the
               pectoral band of the cuirass, a wavy line under it, and an undulation embellishing the left vertical band, while the angel on the reverse is
               represented in a similar way except for a general elongation more marked in the figure at <name type="place">Constantinople</name>.</p>
            <p>The real originality of the African solidi must be sought in their manufacture. As Lafaurie saw, their diameter is slightly smaller; in addition,
               at Carthage the border of the die generally <pb n="42"/> coincides with that of the flan, while at <name type="place">Constantinople</name> the
               flan is often larger than the die.<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref> The line which forms this border is somewhat flatter and larger by some
               millimeters at <name type="place">Constantinople</name>, while in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name> it is narrower and
               more pronounced. This is only one aspect of the more heavily accented relief which, together with the design of the eyes (often highlighted by a
               stroke beneath) constitutes the major characteristic of the gold coinage of Carthage. Nevertheless two distinctive styles must be differentiated
               within the mint. One, which I would characterize as "Constantinopolitan," is only distinguished from that of the capital by the singular
               workmanship mentioned above. The other I would call "African," and it is rougher and "stereotyped," so to speak, and of cruder engraving. It
               displays on the reverse a smaller star and angel<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref> whose cross (at least on the coins with Γ) encloses in its arms
               the I of VICTORIA, now reduced to a tiny stroke. On the obverse the last letter of the legend nearly disappears, a C reduced to a line so near to

            <p>The Constantinopolitan style is heavily predominant. Virtually all the issues with I, <hi rend="bold">IA</hi>, and IB share it (with one
               exception each for the two latter), as do two-thirds of those with Γ. The African style is represented by the remaining third with Γ, the three
               specimens with ⊖, and the IA/ΛΦP solidus. In its broad outline, this distinction did not escape <name type="pname">Hahn</name>, who saw an
               evolution over time leading from the first solidi, "quite naturally very similar to the Constantinopolitan style," to that group of peculiar
               style whose development might be attributed either to "comparative isolation from Constantinople or equally to the recruitment of local
                  engravers."<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref> Yet in spite of the very significant place he assigned throughout his work to dating by regnal year
               or indiction, he continued, with <name type="pname">Lafaurie</name> and <name type="pname">Hendy</name>,<ref target="#CH4-n12">12</ref> to regard
               the letters on the reverses as an indication of supplementary officinae (IA and IB) created for this purpose, or of detachments from the third
               and tenth officinae of Constantinople (Γ and I). Consideration of the piece in Copenhagen with ⊖, however, led him to ask whether such a series
               of officinae was not too numerous for a provincial mint, only at once to underscore the difficulties of an indictional interpretation.<ref
                  target="#CH4-n13">13</ref> We hope here, starting from the analysis of as great a body of documentation as possible (89 examples from
               Tunisian, American, and European collections and from sale catalogues) to present a solution which at once takes into account the elements of the
               numismatic documents and the historical events that may have influenced monetary output.</p>

                  <p>Coin 90 was acquired from Bank Leu, November 1967, with another solidus of Carthage (above, 51), a Burgundian solidus, and two other
                     Byzantine solidi but had no apparent relationship to them. According to <name type="pname">Mrs. S. Hurter</name>, whom we gratefully
                     acknowledge for having searched at our request through her archives, these coins originated from a collection "which had been built up in
                        <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</name>." But the fact that 51 is known to have belonged to the Bicklin
                     collection acquired either in <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> or in <name type="place"
                        corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name> throws doubt on the archaeological value of the Portuguese origin of the lot — see the
                     observations of <name type="pname">J. P. Callu</name>, in <hi rend="italic">Crise ei redressement dans les provinces europ�ennes de
                        l'Empire, mil. du Ill�-mil. du IV� s. ap. J.C.</hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2973783">Strasbourg</name> 1983), p. 162, n.
                     38, about a similar origin attributed to an unpublished hoard of the early fourth century. Otherwise, 90 must be considered an intruder in
                     the lot.</p>
                  <p>This coin differs much in style from the two preceding coins; it recalls the obverses of 33 and 34 (i.e. the same high placing of the
                     central line and the disappearance of the final C in the reverse legend which is entirely confused with the shield border on 33 and 34).
                     The reverse, less rough, recalls those of 2 through 12, as the reverse I is wedged in the angle of the crossbar. It might be an imitation
                     or may simply have been a recurrence of the African manner.</p>

                  <p>Contrary to <name type="pname">P. Grierson's</name> advice, <name type="pname">A. R. Bellinger</name> in <hi rend="italic">DOC</hi> 1
                     included among the issues of Carthage a solidus (298) with IB and an angel holding a cross with christogram. Despite the corrections in <hi
                        rend="italic">BNC</hi> 1, p. 66, n. 5, and <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 1, p. 48, n. 10, this attribution still causes some confusion.
                     These non-African IB issues of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 7 only differ from other Constantinopolitan issues of the same type through the
                     letters at the end of the reverse legend. No specimen has ever been found in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name> and
                     the known provenances point to their circulation (and possible issue by a provisional military mint such as that which operated in Salona
                     for copper?) in the Balkans. There are no die links among the extant specimens. The following short list has been compiled from my own

                  <p>The dating criteria at our disposal are not very numerous. On the one hand, the occurrence of solidi with facing bust, introduced at <name
                        type="place">Constantinople</name> in 537, and on the bronze beginning in year 12 (538) furnishes a terminus ante quern. On the other,
                     comparison with the stylistic development of the folles and other bronzes of Carthage indicates a close relationship between the solidi
                     with Γ of African style and certain half folles of year 13. Both are characterized by the symmetrical pattern of the upper part of the
                     cuirass and its decoration with two pellets which generally replace the three of the horizontal band: <graphic url="NS17_sym13.jpg"/>

                  <p>In Byzantine numismatics, comparison with bronze coinage marked with a mint name has permitted the more or less secure identification of a
                     certain number of provincial gold coinages. This principle is the basis of the pioneering studies of the mints of <name type="place"

                     the same engravers were responsible for the dies of denominations in all three metals. Even if, in the administrative plan, the <hi

                  <p>At Carthage application of this principle can be pressed further, and stylistic comparison can establish a fixed point for chronology. The
                     distinction between the two styles established for the gold is in fact observed on the bronze as well as on the silver. In the latter
                     metal, where the immobilization of the profile bust precludes comparison with the solidus, the general tendency is nonetheless clear. One
                     moves from a first issue (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 51, <hi rend="bold">VOT MVLTI MTI</hi>) bearing an image closely related to that of
                        Gelimer<ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref> and likewise of Hilderic by the characteristic stiffness and schematism of the diadem and the
                     folds of the chlamys to a series (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 52, monogram of Justinian)<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref> where the quality of
                     the rendering of the hair, for example, is reminiscent of that of coins from the capital. The evolution of the bronze—most interesting in
                     that it is in part dated from 539/40 (<name type="pname">Justinian's</name> thirteenth regnal year) and even from 538/9 (the second
                     indiction)—is exactly similar. The undated folles as well as the exceptional follis of the second indiction (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi>
                     N185) show signs of the same stiffness characteristic of the African style. This continues on a part of the bronzes of regnal year 13, and
                     especially on most of the folles and half folles with SO (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 194 and 196) which make up the first part of the

                  <p>The exclusive use of the facing bust on the gold coinage, which does not allow its introduction to be placed before 537, and the existence
                     of solidi with Γ make dating by regnal year impossible. There remains indictional dating, which I favored in 1970 without being able to
                     enter into detailed classification of the issues then known (Γ, ⊖, I, <hi rend="bold">IA</hi>).<ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref> The
                     stylistic development of the dated bronze leads to the search for a parallel tendency in the gold coinage and to placing first the issues
                     of African style, i.e. the unique piece in Paris with ΛФP (1) and the first group of solidi with Γ (2-12). The piece in the Bibliothèque
                     Nationale must also be separated from other solidi <pb n="52"/> with IA. But such a distinction is inescapable considering the close
                     relationship between this first piece and the beginning of the issue with Γ (compare 2-5, 6-7) and, by contrast, the complete absence of
                     elements common to pieces with <hi rend="bold">IA CONOB</hi>, all Constantinopolitan with the three characteristic pellets on the pectoral
                     band of the cuirass. On these last, the mark <hi rend="bold">IA</hi> is that of the eleventh indiction. On the other hand, the Paris
                     solidus bears witness to that liking for ambivalence so common in Byzantine coin inscriptions: here in fact <hi rend="bold">IA</hi>
                     simultaneously indicates the eleventh year and the the first indiction (<hi rend="italic">ἰνδιϰτιῶνος πρώτης</hi>), a coincidence unique in
                     the course of the reign but one which occurred conveniently as the same moment that Novel 47 was issued to determine the dating of imperial
                     documents, and which obviated for the moneyers a decision for which they lacked instruction.</p>
                  <p>The first solidus struck in Africa in the name of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> is, then, the one that bears the mark of the name of
                     the province, and not <hi rend="bold">CONOB</hi>—nor even one of the compounds which combine the name of the mint with <hi rend="bold"
                        >OB</hi>—which had been <hi rend="italic">de rigueur</hi> since the reforms of Valentinian.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref> From the
                     reign of Zeno to that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo III</name>,<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref> under whom it
                     disappeared, <hi rend="bold">CONOB</hi> was the only mark to appear in the exergue of gold coins, from whatever mint they originated. The
                     only exceptions to this rule, aside from the piece which concerns us here, are the solidus of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> with
                        ΛΛЮOB<ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref> and a solidus and a tremissis of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> with <hi rend="bold"
                        >ROMOB</hi> (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 28 and 35). These last deserve attention, for they constitute what is in effect the Italian
                     counterpart of the African coinage. Like it, they are rare, and thus may belong to a special issue; second, the more common series which
                     follow them revert to the traditional exergue; and last but not least they are the first gold coins following the reconquest. It therefore
                     seems that the authorities wished to note the return to imperial control of the two most prestigious cities or provinces that had been
                     seized from them. In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, the Valentinianic tradition suggested a repetition of the
                     mark <hi rend="bold">ROMOB</hi>,<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref> while at Carthage, where the yellow metal had never been struck, latitude
                     was allowed to celebrate the name of the province rather than that of its capital.<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The autonomy of the African mint is also manifested about the same period in the bronze coinage by the striking of an exceptional follis,
                     also known in only a single example, with the legend <hi rend="bold">FELIX INDICTIO(NIS) II</hi> (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> N185). This
                     was probably a result of the dilemma posed for dating by Novel 47 for all imperial acts. In the absence of precise instructions and as it
                     was impossible to mark the coins by all the methods—regnal year, consulate, and indiction—the mint authorities at Carthage chose the
                     indictional date before conforming the following year (regnal year 13) to the Constantinopolitan pattern on the bronze.<ref
                        target="#CH4-n26">26</ref> The local character of the <pb n="53"/> piece is also evident in the obverse legend <hi rend="bold"
                        >DOMNIIVSTINIANI PPA</hi>, where the expansion <hi rend="bold">DOMNI</hi> as well as the use of the genitive in the titulary constitute
                     a <hi rend="italic">hapax legomenon</hi>.<ref target="#CH4-n27">27</ref> Another eccentricity is the exaggered importance of the cross with
                     alpha and omega above the mark of value. It occupies almost as much space as the latter, whereas at other mints the usual marks (cross,
                     chrismon, etc.) rarely extend more than a little beyond the top of the M.<ref target="#CH4-n28">28</ref> Finally, the style remains
                     markedly peculiar, recalling in its rigidity (note especially the linear rendering of the diadem) the style of earlier undated folles like
                        <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 184b, with the chrismon on the chlamys and the officina mark Γ.<ref target="#CH4-n29">29</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>This second indiction (538/9) does not seem to have had any great effect on the coinage, since in fact no solidus nor any bronze coins bear
                     its mark. But it is very probable that the striking of folles and fractions of the undated series continued and that, the ΛФP issue having
                     constituted only an exceptional series intended for distributions, the provincial authorities contented themselves with the use of gold
                     consigned from <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. A clue is provided by examination of the composition of finds including solidi of
                        <name type="pname">Justinian</name> which have come to light in <name type="place">Tunisia</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n30">30</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>In spite of the very imperfect nature of the documentation, the table shows that the Constantinopolitan solidi of <name type="pname"
                        >Justinian</name> are the most heavily represented in the group, and that they make up an overwhelming preponderance in deposits
                     slightly later than 542, which are probably contemporary with the troubles and devastations of the years 543 to 545 (El-Djem, Dougga,
                     Lemta). In the absence of further information concerning the dispersed portion of the Souassi hoard, buried in or about 548, it is
                     difficult to interpret it as proof of a growing role for the mint of Carthage in supplying the province with cash. But it is certainly no
                     accident that the issue with <hi rend="bold">IA</hi>, the most heavily represented in this deposit, is precisely the one that according to
                     estimates (see below) had the greatest output. That the solidi of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> and <name type="pname">Justin
                        II</name> from the capital eventually give way in favor of local solidi in later finds (Djebibina, post-573, Es-Sermita, post-615) is a
                     phenomenon already discussed elswhere.<ref target="#CH4-n31">31</ref> On closer inspection, the distribution of the different issues of
                        <name type="pname">Justinian</name> in the Tunisian finds confirms the chronology proposed: the solidi with Γ (<hi rend="italic"
                        >MIB</hi> 25) are associated with the earliest coins of <name type="place">Constantinople</name> (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 5) in the
                     Dougga hoard, around which must be arranged, on the one side, the metropolitan issues of El-Djem prior to 542 and, on the other, the
                     provincial strikings of Souassi dated 546 to 548. Such a pattern, imperfect as the picture may be in the fragmentary state of our
                     knowledge, supports the idea of a relatively late beginning of the striking of gold at Carthage, as well as the distinction made between
                     the IA/ΛΦP issue of 537/8 (1) and the normal <hi rend="bold">IA</hi> issues of 547/8 (57-87). It also highlights the relative autonomy of
                     the provincial mint inasmuch as it did not comply with the typological change carried out on the metropolitan and Italian solidi in 542.
                        <pb n="54"/> Carthage, as already underscored by <name type="pname">Hahn</name> (<hi rend="italic">MIB,</hi> p. 51), never adopted the
                     cross with christo-gram of the last class of Constantinopolitan gold, and kept to the simple cross reverse type down to the latest issue in
                     548/9.</p>

                     <p>There was not at that time a "reorganization of the prefecture by <name type="pname">Solomon</name>," as <name type="pname">Hahn</name>
                        suggests. The text cited (<hi rend="italic">Vand.</hi> 4.19. 1-4) says only that "the emperor entrusted all the affairs of <name
                           type="place">Libya</name> to <name type="pname">Solomon</name>," <hi rend="italic">Βασιλενς Σολόμωνι αύθις απαντα Λιβύης τά πράγματα
                           ένεχείρισε,</hi> meaning only that at that time Solomon was magister militum or praetorian prefect, as the inscriptions confirm,
                           <name type="pname">J. Durliat</name>, <hi rend="italic">Les D�dicaces d'ouvrages de d�fense dans l'Afrique byzantine,</hi> Collection
                        de l'école française de <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> 49 (1981), pp. 1-59. But such a concentration of civil
                        and military forces is already attested during the first prefecture of <name type="pname">Solomon</name> in 535-36. Even if the
                        inscriptions cited by <name type="pname">Diehl</name> (above, n.a), p. 117, only agree with his second prefecture, as Durliat has shown,
                        it is nonetheless clear that Solomon, as prefect (compare Novels 36-37), was in essence the commander of the Byzantine armies in <name
                           type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name> (<hi rend="italic">Vand.</hi> 4.10.1, 4.11, etc.). The same situation exists
                        under Justin II, and it is therefore improper to speak of a reorganization of the prefecture and the return of <name type="pname"
                           >Solomon</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>.</p>

                        </table> Commandant de Bray's presentation is very confused, often vague and even erroneous. In fact he attributes to <name type="pname"
                           >Justin I</name> "nine examples with bust holding globus cruciger and reverse Victory facing holding a globe and a long cross" (p.
                        103) which can only be solidi of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> from <name type="place"
                           >Constantinople</name> (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 5) or Carthage (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 25). Nonetheless the comparison of
                        these descriptions with the composition of the Bardo lot inspires belief in the identity of the finds. Since the "administration" to
                        which the pieces were submitted is not specified, it is possible that not all the pieces were sent to the <name type="place"
                           >Bardo</name>. One difficulty remains: the absence from de Bray's inventory of the easily noted coins of the two Leos and Zeno; but
                        the identity of the rare piece of <name type="pname">Justin</name> and <name type="pname">Justinian</name> would seem to eliminate
                        doubts.</p>

                        officina mark or mint mark on the chlamys (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 185c and 187). Thus it is not possible to place the issue after
                        547/8. Possibly it is a question of a series parallel to the current type of dated dekanummion (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 199) and the
                        corresponding pentanummion (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 203) designated for the distributions in 537 ? Certainly the series is very

                  </head>
                  <p>Once this sequence and its proposed dating are accepted, they can be set against the pattern of political events which may have prompted
                     the <hi rend="italic">local</hi> issue of gold as well as of copper coins. Striking similarities in fact appear in the chronological
                     evolution of the two metals, except during the first years following the reconquest. The most urgent task for the authorities was to
                     replace the silver and copper currency of the Vandal kings with imperial types; and gold, which even in Vandal times had remained an
                     unchallenged imperial monopoly, was easily provided from the capital, as we have seen above. After Justinian's reform in 538, the issue of
                     a nearly complete series of bronze denominations, from the follis to the nummus, dated regnal year 13, parallels the Γ solidi of the
                     corresponding indiction, while the rare half folles of regnal year 22 (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 198) may be the counterpart of the
                     equally rare <hi rend="bold">IB</hi> solidi. If we take for granted the attribution of the <hi rend="bold">VICTORIA</hi> dekanummia and
                     pentanummia (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 200 and 204) to the 547-52 lustrum, as argued by <name type="pname">Hahn</name>,<ref
                        target="#CH4-n32">32</ref> they could as well parallel the issues of the last <hi rend="bold">IA</hi> solidi in 547/8. It would thus not
                     be fortuitous that when the issue of gold ceases in 548/9, no significant bronze is issued except the + I + /CON dekanummium (<hi
                        rend="italic">MIB</hi> 201), which the overstrikes clearly place after <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 200.</p>
                  <p>Examination of the sequence of gold issues and political events reveals another more important coincidence. If only the major issues are
                     considered, leaving aside the unique AΦP coin and the θ<ref target="#CH4-n33">33</ref> and IB strikings known from only three specimens
                     each, two groups appear: one in 539/40 (Γ), the other in 546/48. The former is clearly related to the return of Solomon, praefectus and
                     magister militum during the summer of 539;<ref target="#CH4-n34">34</ref> the latter to the appointment and later activity of <name
                        type="pname">John Troglita</name> from the end of 546 onward. In both cases, the appointment of a new comman-er-in-cheif <pb n="57"/>
                     takes place after a series of disorders of varying importance in the army. In 538, Procopius mentions a conspiracy partly caused by a
                     protest against long-delayed pay;<ref target="#CH4-n35">35</ref> in 545/6 a similar arrearage in pay is the principal reason underlying
                     Guntarith's revolt. No doubt the new nominees managed to restore law and order by paying what was due the soldiers from the state,<ref
                        target="#CH4-n36">36</ref> probably with coins newly struck for the occasion.</p>
                  <p>The above pattern is that shown by the relative rarity of preserved specimens. A more precise though fundamentally similar picture is given
                     by die analysis of the material. Using the various methods devised by <name type="pname">I. D. Brown</name>, <name type="pname">C.
                        Carcassonne</name>, and <name type="pname">J. Möller</name>, the original number of dies for each issue (which can be considered an
                     index of coin production) is estimated (see <ref target="#fig-9">Figure 1</ref> and Table 3).<ref target="#CH4-n37">37</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Γ (539/40) and the I (546/7) issues lie in the same range with a score of estimated obverse dies (23 and 18 respectively), while the
                        <hi rend="bold">IA</hi> (547/8) issue is clearly the most plentiful of all with 35 estimated obverse dies. It may well have been related
                     to <name type="pname">John Troglita's</name> activity and his building a stronger army against the Levathae.<ref target="#CH4-n38">38</ref>

                  <p>The Africa <hi rend="bold">IA</hi> issue (537/8) and the ⊖ (545/6) and IB (548/9) issues are too sparsely represented for any estimate to
                     be possible: the number of preserved coins and dies then serves as the lower limit, well below the level for the three main issues. The
                     historical context allows us to consider the Africa type (1) as a small ceremonial issue at a time when the mint practice for gold was
                     still somewhat tentative; the production of coins with ⊖ (32-34) may have been restricted because of the revolt and other difficulties in
                     545/6, while IB (88-89) just represents the fading out ("queue d'�mission") of the abundant <hi rend="bold">IA</hi> issue.</p>
                  <p>Whatever the exact relationship between local circumstances and gold production at <name type="place">Carthage</name> during the reign of
                        <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, there is no doubt that solidi (like bronze) were not issued on a <pb n="60"/> regular annual basis,
                     nor even at fixed intervals. This pattern is much different from that which prevails later at the African mint, and which begins to emerge
                     during the reign of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>.</p>

                        </table> In spite of their number (less than a third of the whole), it is probable that the nine pieces preserved at the Rardo with the
                        ticket "Porto Farina 1944" come from the hoard of Es-Sermita. The proximity of the places, the dates of record, and the close
                        correspondence of the two inventories leave little doubt on this point.</p>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justin_ii">Justin II's</name> gold issues from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</name> have long been confused with Constantinopolitan
                  coinage and were first identified by <name type="pname">Philip Grierson</name> in volume 1 of <hi rend="italic">DOC.</hi> He pointed to four
                  criteria (note to 190c) for distinguishing the coins of <name type="place">Carthage</name>:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The obverse inscription is not broken by the Victory as on other solidi;</item>
                  <item>2. A is regulary used in the legends instead of A;</item>
                  <item>3. The loop at the top of the shield is misunderstood and replaced by the curved elongation to the right of the two lines at the top of
                     the cuirass;</item>
                  <item>4. There are three pellets in the top horizontal bar of the cuirass.</item>
               </list>
               <p>His first observation is true of most issues except all <hi rend="bold">B</hi>, Γ, Δ, and earlier ones (2-12) which have an unbroken
                  inscription like the unique I coin (41). Point 2 applies only to a great majority of reverse legends, obverse inscriptions displaying <hi
                     rend="bold">A</hi> and <hi rend="bold">A.</hi> The last two criteria are of almost general application. The only exception to the fourth
                  criterion is precisely the <hi rend="bold">B</hi> issue (already remarkable for its unbroken inscription) which shows a point on either side
                  below the pteryges and above the horizontal bar of the cuirass, similar to Justinian's Γ in the African style (<name type="pname"
                     >Justinian</name>, 2-12). This is one of the rare obvious connections between the gold coinage of the two emperors, the other perhaps being
                  the systematic design of the loop at the top of the shield as an elongation of the left pteryges that is derived from the loop (or incipient
                  loop) on most of Justinian's later coins (<hi rend="bold">I, IB</hi>). Another peculiarity of the <name type="place">Carthage</name> legends
                  under <name type="pname">Justin II</name> is the absence of the final <hi rend="bold">B</hi> on the obverse: except on the two earliest types
                     (<hi rend="bold">A</hi> and <hi rend="bold">B</hi>), the legends end in <hi rend="bold">PPAV</hi> instead of the <hi rend="bold">PPAVC</hi>
                  used at <name type="place">Constantinople</name>.</p>
               <p>The change in iconography between <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> and <name type="pname">Justin II</name>
                  and the choice of a new type for the reverse, as well as the replacement of the globus cruciger by a Victory on globe on the obverse,
                  precludes close comparison of local styles in these two reigns. But a difference does appear in the design of the cuirass: under Justinian,
                  the pteryges are asymmetrical, or at least separate, whereas under Justin II they always touch one another, often in the middle of the
                  cuirass. During the latter's reign, the gold coins of <name type="place">Carthage</name> do not display any originality in fabric, except
                  perhaps a higher relief in the figure's design. They are also of the same module as metropolitan solidi, and the diameter of the border of
                  dots also equals that at <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. It would appear that the geometrical characteristics of the solidi from the
                  two mints were now very close to one another, perhaps due to more precise specifications from the administration responsible.<ref
                     target="#CH4-n39">39</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Carthaginian solidi do, however, retain distinctive stylistic characteristics besides the four typological criteria mentioned above, namely
                  the higher relief of the figures, the more conspicuous lettering, and, above all, the peculiar treatment of the eyes. Unlike metropolitan
                  coins, they also bear, as they did under <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, a date at the end of the reverse legend. That the <pb n="61"/>
                  letter at the end of this legend has a chronological meaning is indicated not only by the volume of production, which is far too small to
                  account for the activity of ten officinae, but also by 41 and 42 with <hi rend="bold">IA</hi> or IΓ.<ref target="#CH4-n40">40</ref> This last
                  issue precludes the interpretation of the letter as an indictional date, since no thirteenth indiction occurred in the reign of <name

               <p>Table 4 shows the extent to which the gold issues parallel the copper ones. In both metals, <name type="pname">Justin's</name> African coinage
                  began with a <hi rend="italic">primo anno</hi> dating. The undated bronze series with the facing bust of <name type="pname">Justin</name>
                  alone is best attributed to the early years of his reign on the basis of the appearance of a similar type in other mints, from 565 to 569 in
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> and from 565 to 568 in <pb n="62"/> Thessalonica.<ref
                     target="#CH4-n41">41</ref> In gold, with the exceptions only of years 4 (Δ) and 12 (IB), for which no specimens are yet known (although
                  they could well appear in the future), all regnal years of Justin II are represented by one or more specimens. The issue of gold is placed on
                  an annual basis from this reign onward, although it is struck in varying quantities. That of bronze also becomes more regular than it had been
                  under <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, with two other dated issues in regnal years 8 and 10. The later pattern of the Byzantine coinage at
                     <name type="place">Carthage</name>, with regular annual issues of gold and lustral periodicity for silver and copper, thus takes shape

               <p>The variations in output, which estimates of the original number of dies may indicate (Figure 1, above, and Table 5), show two significant
                  peaks for the B and I issues and a smaller one for the Є issue. Both are paralleled in bronze according to our chronology, a fact which

               <p>This description of the establishment of the <hi rend="italic">moneta auri</hi> in <name type="place">Carthage</name> under <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name> and <name type="pname">Justin II</name> can be compared and related to the picture
                  already drawn for the reign of Maurice.<ref target="#CH4-n43">43</ref>
                  <pb n="64"/> The vacillation between regnal year and indictional dating during these two early reigns, which is significantly illustrated by
                  the "bimodal" coin of the next ruler, Tiberius II, with H/I (regnal/ indictional) dating, is not overcome until 597/8, when the first
                  indictional cycle of Maurice ends and thus suppresses the confusion between regnal years and indictions which had obtained since the accession
                  of Maurice in 582. Indictional dating of gold coins, which then became the norm in <name type="place">Carthage</name> for a century, is but an
                  external aspect of the regularity in gold issue achieved in this reign. If the lustral variations in output are set aside, the average
                  estimate for the number of obverse dies per issue amounts to 6.12 (S.D. = 3.56) for Maurice. Under <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, when
                  the trend toward regular annual issue of solidi is already in evidence, the average is only 5.36, with the 5.17 standard deviation showing a
                  higher dispersion of the data. The irregular issues of Justinian—six in a period of 32 years—naturally reach higher individual peaks on the
                  graph (Figure 1), but considered as a whole they surely represent a less significant amount than the gold coinages of <name type="pname"
                     >Justin II</name> and, a fortiori, Maurice. Plotted against the number of years of Justinian's rule in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>, the number of obverse dies used is only on average 2.6, as against 5 for the following reigns. The
                  significantly larger size of the issues in gold by Justinian's successors reflects the increasing regionalization which affected <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>, like other Byzantine provinces, from the second half of the sixth century.</p>

                  <p>
                     <name type="pname">W. Hahn</name> draws my attention to the fact that the absence of any <hi rend="bold">IB</hi> coin could be explained by
                     a shift during Justin II's eleventh regnal year from regnal (<hi rend="bold">IA</hi>) to indictional dating (ΙΓ). In support of this
                     "indictionaľ' interpretation, which was already argued in <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 2, pp. 38 and 40-41, he notes the absence in <name
                        type="place">Carthage</name> of the star mark in the left reverse field, characteristic of the first year issue in <name type="place"
                        >Constantinople</name>. In his opinion this would point to no gold being struck before the first indiction in 567. Considering the
                     tendency to autonomy already displayed in <name type="place">Carthage</name> under <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, I would not give
                     too much weight to this point: the rough parallelism between gold and bronze issues appears to me more important. It should be conceded,
                     however, that the successive bronze issues in years VIII (corresponding to the beginning of a new lustral cycle) and X clearly show that
                     the mint was operating on a dual quinquennial basis whose cycles were alternatively of a fiscal or political nature.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A quarter of a century ago <name type="pname">J. P. C. Kent</name> presented a clear and influential survey of the administrative organization
               which lay behind the supply of gold coinage in the later Roman Empire. Taking as his point of departure a balanced assessment by <name
                  type="pname">J. W. E. Pearce</name>,<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> he deliberately emphasized one aspect, namely the government's urgent need
               for coined gold to pay the stipends of its soldiers and functionaries and to fulfill the heavy periodic demands of accession donatives and
               quinquennial donatives. These demands were met through the collection of onerous taxes payable in gold. <name type="pname">Kent</name> went on to
               describe the gathering of tax by city councils, who forwarded it to diocesan treasuries. In the fourth century the work of provincial mints was
               linked to these treasuries, but from 366/7 onward the striking of gold became centralized. With a few exceptions it was permitted only at the <hi
                  rend="italic">comitatus</hi> or imperial residence. The gold collected in each province was carried to the <hi rend="italic">comitatus</hi> in
               the form of ingots (of which there are late fourth century examples with the stamps of the Thessalonica treasury),<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>
               and there a <hi rend="italic">moneta auri,</hi> which was a palatine department quite separate from the older <hi rend="italic">monetae
                  publicae,</hi> converted it into coin.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Kent</name> saw that, within the administrative framework he described, the minting of gold at Thessalonica in the fifth
               century was anomalous. He suggested that the clue to this puzzling situation was to be found in similar situations at Ravenna and probably also
                  <name type="place">Carthage</name>, where the praetorian prefects were expressly assigned a detachment from the officium of the <hi
                  rend="italic">comes sacrarum largitionum,</hi> to enable them to coin small quantities of gold.<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> Kent's keen
               insight remains the basis of our understanding of the matter today: there was a palatine <hi rend="italic">moneta auri</hi> at Thessalonica
               because the city was the seat of the pretorian prefect of <name type="place">Illyricum</name>.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Hahn</name> has now firmly ruled out the idea tentatively floated by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084"
                  >Bellinger</name> and others during the 1960s and 1970s that sixth-century solidi with the mint signature <hi rend="bold">CONOB</hi> might
               have been minted at a variety of places, in particular those where there was a <hi rend="italic">moneta publica</hi> striking copper coinage.
               Only the palace or the seat of a prefect might have a mint for gold, "at least under normal conditions."<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> The saving
               clause may still permit debate around Kent's idea that in the fourth and fifth centuries the mint signature <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> referred
               to the <hi rend="italic">comitatus</hi> rather than the <hi rend="italic">comes sacrarum largitionum,</hi> and that there might, exceptionally,
               be a traveling mint which <q>This study ought in truth to have appeared jointly under <name type="pname">Wolfgang Hahn's</name> name as well as
                  my own. His modesty and insistence should not be allowed to conceal the fact that much of the enterprise and much of the hard work were his. I
                  am deeply grateful to him for his encouragement and friendship.</q>

               Thessalonica in ca. 408. It will be argued below that they are not Thessalonican, but that some of them are from a separate Illyrican mint.<ref

            <p>The numismatic facts about Thessalonica upon which <name type="pname">Kent</name> relied in reaching his assessment that its gold coinage was
               anomalous have been changed substantially by the recognition that the mint continued to be active long after the time of Basiliscus, indeed
               throughout the sixth century and into the early seventh. Its later products were not readily identified because they were marked <hi rend="bold"
                  >CONOB</hi> (rather than <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> or <hi rend="bold">THSOB</hi>). They are distinguished chiefly by the addition of stars in
               the reverse field or by other small variations from the design in use at <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</name> made the attribution in <hi rend="italic">DOC</hi> 1, noting that the coins lacked an officina
               numeral on the reverse and that the tradition of adding two stars went back to coins of which the Thessalonican attribution was not in doubt.<ref
                  target="#CH5-n6">6</ref>
               <name type="pname">Fagerlie's</name> monograph on the Scandinavian finds, published also in 1967, proposed the same attribution, and she should
               probably have the credit as the originator.<ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref>
               <name type="pname">Hahn</name> presented the case more explicitly in <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 1, referring to the highly important late sixth
               century hoard of gold found at Thessaloniki itself in 1948. This hoard has recently been fully published, with excellent illustrations of every
               coin, by Oeconomides and Touratsoglou.<ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref> Most of the coins are from the local mint, and the hoard site may be thought
               to place their attribution beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>
            <p>Gold was struck at Thessalonica, then, steadily from ca. 408 (although the imperial mint there had its origins a hundred years earlier) until at
               least 616/7.<ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> Towards the end of that time, political circumstances in the west Balkans were altered radically by the
               Avaro-Slavonic incursions and the mint did not survive Heraclius' reforms of the coinage in 629. By then, it had had a special status for more
               than two hundred years. Until Justinian's restoration of the prefectures of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name> and <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, it was the only <hi rend="italic">moneta auri,</hi> other than <name type="place"
                  >Constantinople</name> itself, in the eastern part of the empire. The essential reason for the city's place in the imperial minting
               arrangements was not its great size or its commercial importance—several other cities would have had at least equal claim to a mint for gold if
               that been so—but the fact that it was a major center of fiscal administration. Thessalonica minted gold because it was the seat of the <hi
                  rend="italic">praefectus praetorio per Illyricum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prefecture was a territorial circumscription with fiscal and legal competence. It was responsible for estimating the annual needs of the
               military forces, the civil service, and public works within its boundaries, and for collecting taxes to meet those needs. More and more, those
               taxes were collected in gold. From Thessalonica the whole of <name type="place">Illyricum</name> was administered: if reserves of gold were
               accumulated, it was presumably there that they would be held; if new money was needed, it was presumably there that the need was met.<ref
                  target="#CH5-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>One item in Kent's account therefore provokes hesitation. If the raison d'�tre of the Thessalonica mint was connected with the administration of
                  <name type="place">Illyricum</name>, should we not expect to find Thessalonican gold coins making up an important part of the currency
               everywhere in Illyricum ? Why then were only small quantities of gold minted at Thessalonica ? And what are we to understand by small? Small
               absolutely, or just small in relation to <name type="place">Constantinople</name>?</p>
            <p>The prefecture, which was so vast at the date of the <hi rend="italic">Notitia Dignitatum,</hi> stretching from the Danube to Crete, is still
               described as consisting of 13 provinces, covering the same wide territory <pb n="67"/> in the early sixth century, but there may by then have
               been some administrative devolution, and Thessalonica may have been linked more especially with a province corresponding with the old diocese of
               Dacia—roughly Macedonia, the two Dacias, Moesia I, and the easterly part of Pannonia.<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref> This was still a large
               responsibility.</p>
            <p>Admittedly the prefecture of the East, administered from the capital, was (as <name type="pname">Hendy</name>
               <ref target="#CH5-n12">12</ref> has remarked) of wide extent and had a developed, largely urban economy. One would expect the budget of <name
                  type="place">Illyricum</name> to be small in comparison. Not, however, as small as some of the hoard evidence might appear to imply: the
               massive treasure from Szik�ncs, which has been seen as reflecting payments to the Huns, contained 1,433 solidi minted in the eastern part of the
               Empire, among which only one was from Thessalonica.<ref target="#CH5-n13">13</ref> This is doubtless a very misleading measure of the relative
               importance of the <hi rend="italic">moneta ami</hi> and merely reflects the fact that the payment in question consisted of moneys emanating from
               the treasury at <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. A better indicator is provided by the finds from Scandinavia. Among more than 750 late
               Roman and Byzantine solidi of the fifth and sixth centuries found in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</name> and <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, nearly 400 are from the mint of <name type="place">Constantinople</name>, over 200
               are from Italian mints, and only 23 are from Thessalonica.<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> The relative scarcity in commerce of Thessalonican
               solidi compared with those from <name type="place">Constantinople</name> is probably much greater than the Scandinavian ratio of 17:1 would
               suggest, but this may be because so many of the coins reaching western European markets originated from the Middle East.</p>
            <p>Numismatists have referred until now to single specimens or to very small numbers of Thessalonican solidi and have certainly contrived to leave
               the impression, intentionally or otherwise, that the scale of the Thessalonican issues was small absolutely. This was perhaps a natural
               assumption. Even major public collections are generally able to show only one or two specimens from each reign, if indeed they are fortunate
               enough to hold any at all. Study of the series has been limited for the most part to a simple listing of the different types and varieties known
               to exist, reign by reign.</p>
            <p>But in order to bring numismatic research into contact with historical studies of the fifth and sixth centuries, two further steps are needed.
               First, a more quantitative approach is desirable. We have to ask ourselves (even if no exact answer is possible) how much gold coinage was
               struck. Evidence exists, in that the solidi were struck from a number of different dies. By assembling a corpus of specimens and carefully
               comparing their dies we can estimate statistically how large or small that number was. The project has been limited to the period from ca. 408
               onward, from which it has been possible to assemble an astonishing total of 468 specimens of Thessalonican gold, among which there are few die
               duplicates. The original total number of dies will obviously therefore have been several times larger than the sample. This material is presented
               in Appendix 2, The Coins: Types and Summary, and Appendix 3, The Coins: An Inventory.</p>
            <p>Second, we can collect evidence of how the coins were used once they had been issued. If Thessalonica was the mint for <name type="place"
                  >Illyricum</name>, to what extent was the currency of <name type="place">Illyricum</name> supplied by that mint? And were Thessalonican coins
               carried further afield? Hoards, Appendix 4, part 1, and stray finds, Appendix 4, part 2, show us how far the coins circulated, and an assemblage
                  <pb n="68"/> of all the finds of gold coinage from a region can be analyzed in a variety of ways, including a topographical analysis, which
               may offer clues to the character of monetary affairs. Both steps need to be taken together, because the results of the die estimation may
               influence our reading of the find evidence.</p>
            <p>One must, however, draw a sharp distinction between finds from within and beyond the imperial frontiers. An entirely different set of "laws"
               applies to the latter. The sometimes very large hoards from north of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</name>, such as
               that from Szik�ncs already mentioned, may reflect tribute or booty or imperial gifts designed to impress foreign rulers. <name type="pname"
                  >Fagerlie</name> has shown how the flow of solidi to Scandinavia reflects the presence of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia from 454 to 488;<ref
                  target="#CH5-n15">15</ref> and Kovačević has estimated the tribute paid to the Avars between 558 and 626 at around six million solidi.<ref
                  target="#CH5-n16">16</ref> Once it had left the lands of the Empire, the gold was not, of course, susceptible to being drawn back by imperial
               taxation, although it might well return through trade. Unsettled conditions beyond the frontier may have contributed to a much higher rate of
               loss there or, more precisely, a much higher rate of non-recovery of hoards, so that those hoards known to us may represent a significantly
               higher proportion of the regional stocks of gold than the comparable find evidence from within the Empire.</p>
            <p>As we shall see, by no means all the gold coins from <name type="place">Illyricum</name> were from the Thessalonica mint, and this raises the
               question how those from other mints reached the places where they were lost or concealed. When most of the fourth century gold mints had been
               closed, and the range of denominations simplified, the scope for analysis of the find material is reduced. Any regional movements of gold coins
               are in detail obscured when only the <name type="place">Constantinople</name> and Thessalonica mints remained at work. It is worth glancing back,
               therefore, to some Illyrican hoards of the fourth century to see what mints are represented in them. Similarly the sixth century copper coinage
               affords a fuller opportunity to analyze regional monetary circulation, because more mints struck copper.</p>

            <p>A type of fourth-century hoard, characteristically found just within the frontiers, e.g. along the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7581804"
                  >Danube</name>, is marked by the presence of multiples, and may be associated with the army and even with the presence of the emperor—as in
               the case of the Ljubljana (Emona) hoard of 1956, consisting of triple and double solidi of Constans and Magnentius, minted at <name type="place"
                  >Aquileia</name> (12 specimens) and Thessalonica (1 specimen).<ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref> A Constantinian hoard from Sirmium<ref
                  target="#CH5-n18">18</ref> is more mixed in its composition, but includes a half dozen multiples, from the mints of Nicomedia (4) and
               Thessalonica (2). Like the nearby Borca hoard, which also includes multiples, it has nearly a half pound of gold, and the point has been noted
               that this was the gratuity paid to discharged veterans.<ref target="#CH5-n19">19</ref> When a hoard from the frontier regions includes just one
               or two multiples of a less spectacular size, such as the piece of 1 1/2 solidi in the U�će hoard, yet again from the vicinity of Sirmium,<ref
                  target="#CH5-n20">20</ref> one might similarly think of donatives or stipends paid to military officers, although the coins may have changed
               hands before being concealed, and the last owner would not necessarily have been an official.</p>
            <p>The Ljubljana hoard should be discounted as evidence for the circulating medium, for the group of multiples had clearly stayed together since its
               issue, probably in the possession of the recipient; but it is less obvious how far the U�će hoard should be discounted, since the presence of an
               army is a textbook example of a way in which large amounts of money may be injected into a regional economy that would otherwise be largely
               self-contained. The Borca hoard in any case proves that within at most five years from their dates of issue, a small group of coins on the Danube
               frontier could include examples from seven mints as far apart as <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> and <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>. Similarly the U�će hoard of only five coins includes examples from Alexandria, Nicomedia,
               Siscia, and Trier, and this raises in an acute form the question of how the majority of the gold coins in the finds reached the places where they
               were concealed. Indeed it may raise the further question of whether gold was (in the fourth century) regularly reminted before being reissued by
               the authorities. How rapidly did gold pass from hand to hand in private transactions, once it had been put into circulation through the payment
               of officials? For example, the Ljubljana hoard of 1910, from the mid-fourth century,<ref target="#CH5-n21">21</ref> is larger and therefore
               offers even better evidence of the way in which the issues of different mints were carried from province to province, from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name>, and even from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name>, becoming mingled with
               remarkable rapidity. The bulk of the hoard consists of coins minted from 337 to 340 and although the nearby mint of Siscia is strongly
               represented, so are <name type="place">Trier</name>, <name type="place">Aquileia</name>, Thessalonica, <name type="place">Heraclea</name>, <name
                  type="place">Constantinople</name>, <name type="place">Nicomedia</name>, and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria"
                  >Antioch</name>. The one older coin in the hoard is from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>. It may well be, then, that
               the reduction in the number of gold mints in the fifth and sixth centuries tends to conceal the degree of geographical movement of the coins.</p>
            <p>As regards copper coinage, the Thessalonica mint sometimes supplied a major part, although never all of the <name type="place">Illyrican</name>
               currency. Serbian sites have yielded a proportion of 58 percent for the years 565-82, but the figure was much lower than that both before and
               after. The proportion in <name type="place">central Greece</name> under <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and <name type="pname">Tiberius
                  II</name>, as Popović has pointed out, shows an exactly similar peak of 58 percent.<ref target="#CH5-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Hoards and isolated finds of gold from well within the frontiers of <name type="place">Illyricum</name> should be regarded as normative for the
               purpose of this enquiry. We shall also look at finds from <name type="place">Dalmatia</name>, even though that province did not become part of
               the Illyrican prefecture until late in the sixth <pb n="70"/> century.<ref target="#CH5-n23">23</ref> There are a surprising number of finds
               (mostly from the time of the Avaro-Slavonic invasions) but unfortunately few of them have been adequately published. If they have been dispersed
               without detailed record—and that means inter alia a record which permits individual dies to be checked against future finds—the finer points of
               their evidence have inevitably been lost.</p>
            <p>Once cannot foresee when or how progress will be made: another major hoard from <name type="place">Illyricum</name>, like that found at <name
                  type="place">Thessaloniki</name> in 1948, may come to light next year; or alternatively very little new evidence may turn up for two or three
               decades. Meanwhile, an outline view can be sketched which further discoveries are unlikely to modify substantially.</p>
            <p>Kent's emphasis that gold coins enjoyed a short life in circulation, before being clawed back into the imperial coffers by the ruler's device of
               insisting that taxes should be paid in gold, may possibly be true of other parts of the Empire, but it would not be an obvious conclusion to draw
               from the Illyrican finds. Nor would they lead us to suspect that Thessalonica had any important role as the <hi rend="italic">moneta auri</hi>
               for the official finances of <name type="place">Illyricum</name>. If a short life had been the norm, one would have expected gold hoards to be
               generally small and few and, more surely, to consist largely of almost new coins, including numerous clusters of die duplicates. Also, one would
               have little reason to expect that coins would have had the chance to travel far (except when armies were on the move) before they had been
               recovered in taxation, to be melted down into ingots and in due course reissued as new coins, to begin another short life cycle.</p>
            <p>Yet the age structure of the hoards reveals that a significant proportion of the currency consisted of solidi that had remained in circulation
               for more than ten years. The age structures are, in fact, not markedly different from those found in hoards of other types of coinage, where
               there is no reason to postulate urgent withdrawal. The six coins of Theodosius II which make up the Po�arevac hoard from Moesia I, for example,
               are of types dated by <name type="pname">Hahn</name> as follows: one from 408-22, three from 422-25, one from 430, and one from 443-50. Only one
               coin in the Po�arevac hoard—the latest—is Thessalonican.<ref target="#CH5-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Various late sixth century hoards from <name type="place">Illyricum</name> show a similar age structure. Three finds from Sadovets, in Dacia
               Ripensis, are made up as follows:</p>

            <p>Two interesting features of the hoards (which may well have been concealed in haste in the face of the Avar assaults of 584/5 and the capture of
               Singidunum and Viminacium)<ref target="#CH5-n25">25</ref> are the number of tremisses they contain and the wide variation in the proportions of
               solidi and fractions. Hoard D has a particularly extended age structure, and consists mostly of tremisses. Not <pb n="71"/> a single coin in
               these three hoards is Thessalonican. If the suggested date of deposit is correct it shows that coins of Maurice reached Sadovets from <name
                  type="place">Constantinople</name> within at most two to three years of their issue.</p>
            <p>Three late sixth-century hoards from <name type="place">Dalmatia</name>, possibly unrecovered because of the dangers following the Avar attacks
               on Sirmium in 568 and 569 and the loss of the city in 582,<ref target="#CH5-n26">26</ref> yield very similar conclusions. The Grabovnik find
               (from ca.569?) contained four solidi of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> and 15 of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>. All except one pair
               were from different dies, and only one coin was Thessalonican.<ref target="#CH5-n27">27</ref> The Vid hoard, from the site of the ancient Narona,
               contained 24 solidi of Justinian, a further 24 solidi and six tremisses of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, five solidi and five tremisses of
               Tiberius II, and one tremissis of Maurice. This last coin provides a terminus post quern of 582, and shows that a third of the coins were about
               20 years old. At least two seem to have been from Thessalonica, but probably not more. Die duplication was not recorded, but the wide range of
               officinae represented suggests a well-mixed sample of currency. The Solin hoard (from ancient Salonae) consisted of one coin of Justinian, one of
                  <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, and three of Tiberius. Again, if the suggested occasion of concealment is correct, the latest coins had
               reached the west Balkans swiftly.</p>
            <p>From <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> there are remarkably few records of gold hoards dating from before the closure of
               the Thessalonica mint. The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> (Osteotheke) hoard consisted of five solidi of Tiberius and
               one solidus and one tremissis of Maurice. The coins of Tiberius are all Constantinopolitan; the solidus of Maurice was not sufficiently described
               for its mint attribution to be certain.<ref target="#CH5-n28">28</ref> Other Greek finds, including those from the Peloponnese, Paiania, and
                  Corinth,<ref target="#CH5-n29">29</ref> were incompletely or summarily published, at a time when no one had thought of the attribution of
               post-Zeno coins to Thessalonica.</p>
            <p>The best systematic evidence for the gold currency of Byzantine Illyricum lies in a rather unexpected direction, namely in odd coins, usually
               without an exact provenance, bought by local museums long ago. A catalogue of nineteenth-century finds from <name type="place">Bosnia</name> is
               particularly precious, because it preserves evidence from a period when the coins in question were worth little more than their bullion value,
               and when a curator with an active interest in local finds could hope to recover pieces that today would probably not be reported to the
               authorities. Karlo Patsch in 1900<ref target="#CH5-n30">30</ref> was able to list 55 gold coins ranging from Arcadius to Justinian, most of which
               were bought in Sarajevo, while others came from a collection formed in <name type="place">Imotski</name>, or were from <name type="place"
                  >Izačić</name>, <name type="place">Kladanj</name>, <name type="place">Skender Vakuf</name>, <name type="place">�upanjac</name>, <name
                  type="place">Stolac</name>, <name type="place">Glamoč</name>, <name type="place">�urmanci</name>, <name type="place">Knin</name>, <name
                  type="place">Donji La рас</name>, <name type="place">the Vranplanina</name>, or <name type="place">the Neretva valley</name>. Many are
               probably single finds, while others may be from unrecorded hoards. A good proportion have been pierced, perhaps in modern times, for use as
               jewelry. Among the solidi in the Sarajevo Museum, only one was minted at Thessalonica.</p>
            <p>When all the recorded provenances of fifth and sixth-century gold are marked on a map of <name type="place">northern Illyricum</name>, a rather
               unexpected pattern emerges. The finds are scattered most densely in <name type="place">Dalmatia</name> and its hinterland, far to the northwest
               of Thessalonica. The pattern is no doubt distorted by the fact that such a large proportion of our evidence was collected in <name type="place"
                  >Sarajevo</name>. If there had been another Karlo Patsch in <name type="place">Belgrade</name>, the map would look different. It is fair to
               point out, however, that the Sarajevo provenances mostly lie to the west of the <name type="place">Bosnian</name> capital. The concentration on
                  <name type="place">Lika</name>, <name type="place">Dalmatia</name>, and the <name type="place">Neretva valley</name> is probably a genuine
               distribution. Moreover, the Ostrogothic coins in the Zagreb Museum, recently published by <name type="pname">Żeljko Demo</name>,<ref
                  target="#CH5-n31">31</ref>
               <pb n="72"/> show a similar dual distribution, with numerous finds from <name type="place">Dalmatia</name> and others from <name type="place"
                  >Syrmia</name> (administratively within the scope of the Zagreb Museum) but little from the intervening parts of Croatia.</p>
            <p>Ostrogothic coins are unexpectedly frequent among the finds now in Sarajevo, from the time of Zeno to Justinian—long after the administrative
               link between <name type="place">western Illyricum</name> and the prefecture of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> had
               been severed. <name type="place">Dalmatia</name> evidently maintained links with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, and
               the <name type="place">hinterland</name> with <name type="place">Dalmatia</name>. Specimens are recorded from <name type="place">Skender
                  Vakuf</name>, the <name type="place">Morača valley</name>, and <name type="place">�upanjac</name>. There is a contrast with the evidence of,
               for example, the Grabovnik and Vid hoards, which are close enough to the Adriatic to have shared in the pattern, but which consist essentially of
               coins struck in the third quarter of the century. One may wonder whether the inflows of Ostrogothic money ceased in about the 540s, or whether
               the hoards reflect official payments made exclusively in imperial coin. The former explanation seems preferable, especially where there are
               tremisses in the hoard. This makes the point that the finds are a more evenly spaced sample of the currency than the hoards, which are
               concentrated so much in the 580s and contain few coins from the first half of the century.</p>
            <p>The Bosnian material also very usefully confirms the high proportion of fractions in circulation. Nearly half the catalogued coins are tremisses.
               This makes a very pronounced contrast with the Scandinavian finds, where fractions are most unusual. It is a familiar idea from many ancient and
               medieval series of coinage, of different centuries, that people preferred to exclude the fractions from sums of money set aside, and that, unless
               we are fortunate enough to be able to refer to isolated finds (accidental losses), there may be an important sector of the currency which remains
               "hidden."</p>
            <p>The mint attribution of tremisses is a particularly delicate problem. Where previously none were given to Thessalonica, <name type="pname"
                  >Hahn</name> has found a few which show close stylistic affinities with copper coins of the same mint. The stray finds from Illyricum (and
               indeed the tremisses in the hoards) deserve to be reexamined carefully to see whether more local issues can be distinguished. But as most of the
               solidi are Constantinopolitan, there is no a priori reason why the tremisses should not be so too.</p>
            <p>Another group of finds, smaller, but of equally solid value as evidence and again from the heart of Illyricum, comes from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_788709">Leskovac</name>, near the site of Caricin Grad, in the <name type="place">Morava valley</name> above <name
                  type="place">Ni�</name>, where the museum staff published a list of their holdings shortly after the 1939-45 war.<ref target="#CH5-n32"
                  >32</ref> Ten gold coins ranging from Theodosius II to Phocas have provenances in the environs of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_788709">Leskovac</name> or, in one case, at Ora�će (Gornje Lusarje). Again, half of the pieces are fractions; two semisses
               and three tremisses. Only one solidus, of Theodosius II, was minted at Thessalonica.</p>

            <p>If, putting together the Sarajevo and the Leskovac material, we try to assess the chronological distribution of the finds by dividing the number
               of gold coins from each reign by the number of <pb n="73"/> years of the reign, the resulting graph (<ref target="#fig-11">Figure 1</ref>) will
               only be rough and ready, both because the totals of coins are small and because no allowance is made for the length of time over which different
               issues remained in circulation. The trend which can be discerned is nevertheless sufficiently pronounced to be worth considering: gold was
               relatively plentiful from the middle of the fifth century until about the third quarter of the sixth century.</p>
            <p>The proportions are repeated in the holdings of the Split museum, built up since 1820, and in which Marović reports 11 gold coins of Honorius, 29
               of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_valentinian_iii">Valentinian III</name>, 22 of <name type="pname">Leo I</name>, 26 of <name type="pname"
                  >Zeno</name>, 26 of <name type="pname">Anastasius</name>, 84 of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, 30 of <name type="pname">Justin
               II</name>, and 15 of <name type="pname">Tiberius II</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n33">33</ref> The coins of Valentinian, obviously, are Italian, and
               it would be interesting to know how many Ostrogothic coins there are among the sixth-century totals.</p>
            <p>Single finds do not, of course, provide any information about the age structure of the currency, but there is one further hoard which confirms
               what has been said above and also reiterates the importance of the tremisses. The Thessaloniki find of 1948,<ref target="#CH5-n34">34</ref>
               concealed ca. 580, was almost certainly abnormal in its composition, in that it contained a very high proportion of coins of the local mint and
               among them a great many die duplicates or die linked coins.</p>

            <p>The figures set out in the table suggest that a progressive dispersion of the gold currency took place. From the reign of <name type="pname"
                  >Tiberius II</name>, all five coins in the hoard are from the Thessalonica mint, but from the preceding reign 3 percent of the solidi and 39
               percent of the tremisses are from <name type="place">Constantinople</name>, and one coin has found its way to <name type="place"
                  >Thessaloniki</name> from <name type="place">Ravenna</name>. From the reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> (that is to say, among
               coins that have been in circulation for some 15 years or more, which make up over a fifth of the hoard) 82 percent of the solidi and 88 percent
               of the tremisses are from <name type="place">Constantinople</name>.</p>
            <p>The extensive die linking of the Thessalonica mint coins of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and <name type="pname">Tiberius</name>, both solidi and tremisses, in contrast with the absence of die links among the Constantinopolitan
               coins, shows that the hoard includes a sum or sums that had not changed hands much since they left the mint. The coins of Justin might in
               principle be from the very end of his reign, but it is unlikely that they all are, as there are several varieties among them. One needs to
               compare them with specimens from other sources in order to establish the character of the hoard.</p>
            <p>We should hesitate to deduce from the hoard of 1948 that the composition of the gold currency in Thessalonica itself was greatly different from
               that elsewhere in <name type="place">Illyricum</name> during the fifth and sixth centuries. Not only would such a scheme of monetary circulation
               be contrary to normal expectations, but the hoard itself reveals a progressive dispersal through the third quarter of the century. It is however
               possible that the hoard reflects an unusual confinement of circulation to the city of Thessalonica at the time of an incursion from the
               Sclavinias, to which Menander and <name type="pname">John of Ephesus</name> both refer, and which is most plausibly dated to 581.<ref
                  target="#CH5-n35">35</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Discounting this hoard and leaving to one side the Hajdu�ka Vodenica hoard, the evidence is clear that, throughout Illyricum, the solidi of the
               Thessalonica mint made up only a small <pb n="74"/> proportion of the available gold currency. The same is in all probability true of semisses
               and tremisses. (Elsewhere in the Empire, Thessalonican coins were even less significant, to the point that they have very rarely been recorded.)
               We are left, then, with unanswered questions about how the majority of the Illyrican gold finds, which are coins minted at <name type="place"
                  >Contantinople</name>, reached the more westerly prefecture.</p>
            <p>In terms of social structures and monetary responses there is a distinction to be drawn between the finds from <name type="place">Dalmatia</name>
               and the Adriatic coastlands and those from <name type="place">north-central Illyricum</name>, particularly from the time of <name type="pname"
                  >Justinian</name> onwards. One's impression is that in <name type="place">Dalmatia</name> interregional trade exerted a strong influence on
               the circulation of gold. Along the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</name>, on the other hand, and in the regions towards
               the frontier, finds of gold certainly tend to be concentrated in or near the major garrisons. The corollary is probably that long distance
               circulation was sluggish and local "pools'' of gold existed, as a spin-off from the military presence, in regions where a money economy was
               otherwise of limited scope. The same phenomenon has been observed in, for example, the Dobrogea.<ref target="#CH5-n36">36</ref> From <name
                  type="place">Illyricum</name>, we have noted hoards from Borca and U�će, both in the vicinity of Sirmium, and from Sirmium itself. Other finds
               are from <name type="place">Sisak</name> (Sicia), <name type="place">Po�arevac</name> (Viminacium), <name type="place">Gornja/Donja
                  Vre�ina</name> (a castellum near Naissus), and the <name type="place">Leskovac district</name> (Prima Justiniana).</p>
            <p>Elsewhere in <name type="place">north-central Illyricum</name>, hoards tend to be from urban sites (e.g. <name type="place">Stobi</name> and
                  <name type="place">Bargala</name>). Popović has drawn attention to a contrast between coin hoards up to the end of Justinian's reign (many of
               them from rural localities) and those from the time of Justin II and Tiberius (from fortified sites). To some extent, therefore, we may be
               looking at a chronological rather than a regional distinction.</p>
            <p>The pattern seems not to have been unduly influenced by the choice of sites to excavate, and it is probably fair to say that the local
               availability of gold coinage in north-central Illyricum reflects the stationing of soldiers and officials, particularly from the 560s onward. One
               can see, therefore, how the composition of the currency could be different from one place to another, and (to return to the matter that prompted
               these comments) how the <name type="place">Thessaloniki</name> hoard might after all be typical of the city's currency.</p>
            <p>The survey of provenanced material also leaves us in a position to appreciate the implications for the monetary history of Illyricum of the
               observation that the dies of the Thessalonican solidi are almost all different. The corpus of specimens, Appendix 3, includes the following
               totals:</p>

            <p>Some of these 468 specimens are in public collections, but most have been gathered from illustrated auction and sale catalogues from the photo
               file of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In general, these coins have disappeared into private collections, and their present whereabouts are
               unknown.</p>
            <pb n="75"/>
            <p>Since there is no reason to doubt that the available coins can be treated (hoard material apart) as a random sample in respect to the different
               dies represented among them, statistical procedures can be applied to the material in order to derive an estimate of the total numbers of dies
               originally used. It will be prudent to explain these procedures in some detail, in order to make quite clear what is fact and what is conjecture
               and to show what reseach will be needed in the future if we are to make further progress.</p>
            <p>The most convenient formula<ref target="#CH5-n37">37</ref> states that the number of obverses in a random sample that are linked to other
               obverses in the sample is a measure of the proportion of the total output reflected by known dies. Thus, if among 30 coins there were 4 unique
               obverses, the formula would indicate that the dies in the sample represented 26/30 or 87 percent of the original dies. Further, if 14 different
               dies were represented in the 26 multiple obverses responsible for 87 percent of the coinage, then each die struck on average just over 6 percent
               of those coins. To estimate the total number of obverse dies used for striking the series, at just over 6 percent per known obverse, then
               slightly over 16 obverse dies would have been needed for 100 percent of the coins, suggesting that 2 obverse dies may be still unknown. If the
               missing dies happened to be dies that were underused, 2 "equivalent" dies might be represented by 4 or more actual dies. In using the formula, we
               should be careful to speak of "equivalent" missing dies rather than actual dies as a measure of output.</p>
            <p>If, on the other hand, an issue is represented by 8 specimens among which there is only one pair which share a die, the outcome of estimation is
               much less conclusive. The sample represents only 25 percent of the original output, and the numbers are too small for any confidence to be placed
               in their accuracy. If the next specimen to turn up yields another die link, the estimate changes from 25 percent to 44 percent. The sample, in a
               word, is too small. This is characteristic of the position in which we still find ourselves in studying the Thessalonican gold. In spite of being
               able to present a corpus of over 450 specimens, the total is insufficient because such a small proportion of the dies originally used are known
               to us. As new hoards come to light, it will be necessary to rework the corpus, checking systematically for die duplication, until an estimate is
               reached with a level of accuracy in which we can be reasonably confident.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, it is already clear, in spite of the wide margins of sampling error, that there were originally some hundreds of pairs of dies. If
               this is what is meant by saying that Thessalonica struck solidi in small quantities, what amount should we expect from the <name type="place"
                  >Contantinople</name> mint? And if hundreds of pairs of dies were used, where did all the coins go, seeing that they make up such a small
               proportion of the currency of Illyricum? Was the total stock of currency in Illyricum so large ? Or were payments across the frontier a very
               severe drain on the Empire's resources ?</p>
            <p>The volume of the imperial coinage in the fifth and sixth centuries is of some general historical interest as an index of the level of monetary
               activity in late antiquity. Gold was the major part of the money supply, in terms of its book value, and accordingly it should have first claim
               on our attention. Counting dies does not, unfortunately, provide as simple a way of measuring the size of the currency as might appear at first
               sight.</p>
            <p>First, there is absolutely no way in which we can know how many coins, on average, were struck from each pair of dies. Technically, a reverse die
               was probably capable of striking on average 20,000 solidi or at least as many tremisses, and it is not easy to see why a mint would have gone to
               the trouble of preparing and engraving far more dies than were needed. If the prefecture's budget envisaged an issue of a certain size, it should
               have been possible to know in advance roughly how many dies would be needed. And if an issue was prolonged, further dies <pb n="76"/> could be
               cut as needed. On the other hand, there is very clear evidence from English medieval coinage that the dies for gold were used far less heavily
               than those for silver, for no obvious reason.<ref target="#CH5-n38">38</ref> The conventional figure of 10,000 coins on average from each reverse
               die, or a million solidi (14,000 pounds) from a hundred dies, is well within their technical capacity. They <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have
               been used to that extent; but we cannot prove that in fact they were. It may be more acceptable, therefore, to deal simply in numbers of dies and
               to make comparisons, for example, between Thessalonica and <name type="place">Constantinople</name> in those terms—although, again, it would be
               very difficult to demonstrate that average output per die was similar at the two mints.</p>
            <p>Second, it is the size of the currency rather than mint output which is of interest as a measure of monetary activity. If we cannot say whether
               the average life of a solidus was ten years, or five, or twenty, we introduce another factor of uncertainty of exactly the same size as that
               which arises from not knowing whether on average a die struck 10,000, or 5,000, or 20,000 coins.</p>
            <p>Third, the velocity of circulation is just as much a factor in the effective money supply as the size of the monetary stock.</p>
            <p>With all these reservations in mind, the estimated numbers of reverse dies used at the Thessalonica mint may be calculated as follows:</p>

            <p>Comparative mint output over the two-hundred year period offers a broad context within which to explore the probable reasons for minting gold in
                  <name type="place">Illyricum</name>. If our concern extends to the scale of the currency, the simplest way to present the figures is to divide
               the numbers of dies into the lengths of the reigns, to obtain a measure of average output per year. Figure 2 shows that it varied widely, and in
               practice the fluctuations were no doubt even greater, since the figures for periods of fifteen or twenty years will conceal years during which
               the mint was relatively inactive. To move from a stylistic analysis of the coins and a relative chronology <pb n="77"/> toward an absolute
               chronology, and thus to refine the diagram, would be an extremely speculative and difficult exercise. In principle the only way forward is
               through the discovery of hoards which can be very plausibly associated with particular historical events part way through an issue.</p>
            <p>From the reign of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</name> there are, fortunately, four separate issues of solidi at
               Thessalonica, which can be dated from their types and legends, in conjunction with a fuller series of issues at <name type="place"
                  >Constantinople</name>. The sharp contrast between the level of output from 408 to 440 and in the 440s attracts attention and seems to call
               for some special explanation. <name type="pname">Hahn's</name> reading of the evidence<ref target="#CH5-n39">39</ref> is that there were two
               issues at Thessalonica in the 440s. The <hi rend="bold">VIRTVS EXERC ROM</hi> issue, which is exceedingly scarce, is assigned to 440 or later.
               The <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS TERRAR</hi> issue, for which hundreds of dies were used, falls in the years 443-50.</p>
            <p>Since there are problems about the attribution, and since its correctness is crucial to a monetary interpretation of the coinage, the
               difficulties had better be understood. <name type="pname">Kent</name> suggested<ref target="#CH5-n40">40</ref> that the <hi rend="bold">GLOR
                  ORVIS TERRAR</hi> issue belonged to the sole reign of Theodosius (423-25), and that it was more plentiful at Thessalonica even than at <name
                  type="place">Constantinople</name> because <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_valentinian_iii">Valentinian III</name> was proclaimed Caesar there
               in 424. <name type="pname">Hahn</name> however would date it from 442/3 onwards, noting that the same type was continued by <name type="pname"
                  >Marcian</name>. He finds many reasons for interpreting the <hi rend="bold">IMP XXXXII COS XVII P P</hi> issue at <name type="place"
                  >Constantinople</name> and elsewhere as being destined for the payment of tribute to the Huns—a tribute which reached catastrophic levels in
               447. Perhaps the most cogent evidence for a late date for the <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS TERRAR</hi> issue (which could, after all, have been
               revived after an interval rather than directly continued by <name type="pname">Marcian</name>) comes from the Szik�ncs hoard and from a Bulgarian
               hoard published by <name type="pname">Voirol</name>, each of which includes none or hardly any specimens of <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS
                  TERRAR</hi> against large quantities (247 in Szik�ncs) of <hi rend="bold">IMP XXXXII COS XVII P P.</hi> The earlier issues, from the 420s and
               430s, are present in sufficient numbers for the absence of the plentiful <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS TERRAR</hi> issue to be problematic if it
               were dated to 423-25. If on the other hand it was a very recent issue, its absence is perhaps explicable.</p>
            <p>Still, the question remains why the Thessalonica mint should have struck a military type in great quantities during the years 443-50, having
               previously been far less active. The finds from beyond the imperial frontiers (including the Scandinavian finds) give no encouragement to think
               that the solidi were destined for the payment of tribute. Nor have the <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS TERRAR</hi> coins been found in conspicuous
               quantities in <name type="place">northern Illyricum</name> (note the contrast between <ref target="#fig-11">Figures 1</ref> and <ref
                  target="#fig-12">2</ref>). The reason may lie closer to home.</p>
            <p>Vickers has sketched the extensive program of building which followed the transfer of the seat of the prefecture to Thessalonica, after the
               destruction of Sirmium by the Huns in 442/3. The city needed to be equipped with buildings appropriate to its new status: there had to be a new
               palace in a less vulnerable position than the relatively exposed site of the Tetrarchie palace on the city's eastern edge; up-to-date
               fortifications were required; and churches of imposing proportions had to be built. <name type="pname">Spieser</name> has, however, criticized
               Vickers' interpretation, questioning the extent of this building program. He would argue that, of the major works, only the walls are of
               mid-fifth century date, and that the conversion of the rotunda into a church and the construction of St. Demetrius took place more probably at
               the beginning of the sixth century. In any case Vickers went on to argue (and the point may still be valid) that the widely found brick-stamp
               A-ENT reflects a crash program of buildings works and refers to the first year of an indiction (Sept. 447/8) during which Hormisdas, later <hi
                  rend="italic">Pp Orientis</hi> (Feb. 448-Jan. 449; late 449-April 450) <pb n="78"/> may have been <hi rend="italic">Pp Illyrici</hi>.<ref
                  target="#CH5-n41">41</ref> Our list of prefects of Illyricum is sketchy for the 440s, so that, although transfers from one prefecture to
               another were not usual, it is not impossible that the Hormisdas of the much discussed inscription in brick on the eastern wall of the city was
               the same man. It is puzzling that there should have been a delay until 447/8. A possibility, which seems not to have been considered so far, is
               that Thessalonica may have been badly affected by the earthquake of 447.<ref target="#CH5-n42">42</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Numismatists will be intrigued by the assumption that, until 442/3, the seat of the prefecture was at <name type="place">Sirmium</name>. If that
               were so, should one not expect, in accordance with the theory of <hi rend="italic">moneta auri</hi> discussed above, that the earlier coins of
               Theodosius would have been minted at <name type="place">Sirmium</name>, and not at Thessalonica ? The evidence for the whereabouts of the prefect
               in the first part of the century is tenuous. <name type="pname">Stein</name> expressed the opinion that from 395 the seat of the new Illyrican
               prefect was at Thessalonica; and it is difficult to imagine where else it could have been, unless at <name type="place">Stobi</name>, for Sirmium
               seems not to have been transferred to the East until some time between 424 and 437, and more probably the latter date.<ref target="#CH5-n43"
                  >43</ref> If that is so, Sirmium could have been the seat of the prefecture for only a short time before 441/2. It may be, therefore, that the
               only issue of gold coinage which raises a problem is the VIRTVS EXERC ROM type dated by Hahn to the years 440-43. At <name type="place"
                  >Constantinople</name> it was minted by nine if not ten officinae, but at Thessalonica it is very rare. The other horn of the dilemma is to
               know why such an extensive program of buildings was required in 447/8, if the prefecture had only recently left Thessalonica.<ref
                  target="#CH5-n44">44</ref>
            </p>
            <p>All these difficult and inconclusive arguments about events in 447/8 which might provide a context for the copious <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS
                  TERRAR</hi> issue are prompted by the virtual absence of the type from Szik�ncs and other hoards, and its scarcity in <name type="place"
                  >Scandinavia</name>. The choice of a military type is a serious obstacle to any theory that expenditure on public works accounted for the
               large size of the issue. Perhaps an explanation for both the type and the size of the coinage is to be sought in the first expedition against the
               Vandals.</p>
            <p>The next problem is <name type="pname">Leo's</name> issue of consular solidi on a large scale at Thessalonica, but not at <name type="place"
                  >Constantinople</name>. The coins cannot be assigned to one rather than another of Leo's four consulships (458, 462, 466, 471). The issue is
               specifically non-military in type, and thus neither the second expedition against the Vandals in 461 nor the installation of Anthemius in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> in 467 has any obvious connection.</p>
            <p>The large estimated number of dies for the twenty-month reign of Basiliscus also seems to call for some special explanation. There is no obvious
               event in the history of the city of Thessalonica itself to which the coinage could be referred. If the mint was active in order to provide
               accession donatives, Basiliscus' coinage may not be significantly different from that of longer reigns, <pb n="79"/> where the average number of
               dies per annum may conceal a similar phase of early activity. It should also be noted that the estimate for Basiliscus rests on a very inadequate
               statistical basis.</p>
            <p>Where more than one variety was issued during a long reign, such as Justinian's, one should resist the temptation to establish an absolute
               chronology which mirrors the relative chronology indicated by stylistic variation. Most of the dies might have been used within a brief period,
               or their use might have been spaced out evenly through the reign, and it is exceptionally difficult to obtain evidence one way or the other. The
               association of varieties with quinquennial periods on general or a priori grounds is a stimulating exercise provided its speculative character is
               recognized. For Justinian's Thessalonican solidi, stylistic arguments taken together with the hoard evidence cast doubt on the proposed sequence
               of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 20 and 21 and on <name type="pname">Hahn's</name> dating of them before and after 537 respectively (see Appendix
               2). The date of the change to <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 22 is likewise conjectural, although we may be confident that it was after 538. <hi
                  rend="italic">MIB</hi> 22 is absent from the Hajdučka Vodenica hoard, in which the latest Thessalonican coins (and they are present in
               considerable numbers) are of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 20.<ref target="#CH5-n45">45</ref> The site is on the south bank of the Danube, and the
               shattering attack by the Kutrigurs in 540, in the course of which thirty-two Illyrican fortresses were captured, might seem the obvious occasion
               for its deposit—were it not that the hoard apparently includes <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 7, which <name type="pname">Hahn</name> dates to 542
               onwards, in connection with a weight reduction of the copper coinage and consequent changes in the design of light weight solidi. One should
               think rather, therefore, of the second appearance of the Kutrigurs in Illyricum in 544, or even of later raids, such as that in 548 when the
               Slavs crossed the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</name> into <name type="place">Illyricum</name> and penetrated as far as
                  <name type="place">Dyrrachium</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n46">46</ref> There were raids almost every year at this time, and those of which we
               have records (e.g. in 550, past Ni�, or in 559, through <name type="place">Moesia</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia"
                  >Macedonia</name> and <name type="place">Thessaly</name>) are not the only ones which could have affected the Danube frontier. Thus the
               chronology of the coins and the historical circumstances in which the hoard was concealed are both somewhat problematic.</p>
            <p>Of events in Thessalonica itself in Justinian's reign we know very little. Perhaps we should be looking there, rather than on the <name
                  type="place">northern frontiers of Illyricum</name>, for a monetary context for the locally minted gold—as has been suggested above for the
                  <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS TERRAR</hi> coins of Theodosius II. The relatively large quantities of gold minted at Thessalonica might reflect
               simply the general prosperity of Justinian's reign, or they might be linked more directly with the program of defensive building works. There is
               very little in the pattern of finds (other than the Hajdučka Vodenica hoard itself) which favors the latter theory: none of the Sarajevo or
               Leskovac coins of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> is from the Thessalonica mint; there are no other frontier provenances; and there are not
               even many specimens in the regional museums—out of 38 examples in <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 22, only one is in <name type="place"
                  >Belgrade</name> and another is in <name type="place">Zagreb</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n47">47</ref> The reigns of Marcian and of Anastasius,
               though not as lengthy, are just as uncertain as regards the chronological spread of the solidus dies and the reasons for minting.</p>
            <p>The pattern of the late sixth century is of declining gold output from the Thessalonican mint—and almost certainly a sharp decline relative to
                  <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. Since the issues of Tiberius II were certainly on a small scale, the change antedates the year 578,
               and thus would seem to antedate the various attacks and disruptions in the western Balkans to which the sources refer. Popović has pointed out
               that this is perhaps because the authors are silent about Sclavinian incursions in the period 558-78, rather than because there were no
                  disturbances.<ref target="#CH5-n48">48</ref> He has <pb n="80"/> drawn attention to no fewer than ten hoards with closing dates between 567/8
               and 571/2. Five of the ten are from Caričin Grad (Prima Justiniana), where there is archaeological evidence of coins of the 570s from late
                  walls.<ref target="#CH5-n49">49</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Thessalonican gold of Maurice is equally scarce today, as is that of Heraclius. It is unlikely that it was ever plentiful, for it would have
               found its way into the hoards of the period—including, one must assume, a certain number of hoards dispersed without record. The curve of mint
               output thus offers few insights into the purposes for which gold was coined. It is to be hoped that the detailed analysis of future hoards will
               clarify the patterns of monetary circulation.</p>
            <p>Another aspect of the mint's work deserves mention. The ratio in which reverse and obverse dies were used was not always the same. Under <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</name> and <name type="pname">Marcian</name> the ratio seems to have been close to
               parity, but from then on several reverse dies were used with each obverse, until 491. Anastasius seems to have reverted to a 1:1 ratio, but under
                  <name type="pname">Justinian</name> and <name type="pname">Justin II</name> it was certainly more, varying between about 3:1 and 5:1. The
               tremisses of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and of Maurice, however, employ a 1:1 ratio. It is intriguing that there should have been
               different practices in the mint concurrently, and one wonders whether tremisses were not supplied to the public in small quantities on
               demand.</p>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Kent</name> discerned a moment of change at Thessalonica in a series of solidi which (in his view) make the transition from
                  the mark <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> to <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi>. "The first pieces," he wrote, "assignable beyond possible doubt to that
                  mint are of the <hi rend="bold">CONCORDI AAVGG</hi> issue of ca. 408-ca. 420 marked <graphic url="NS17_080a.jpg"/> and <graphic
                     url="NS17_080b.jpg"/>. Thereafter, at least until the reign of Basiliscus, Thessalonica coined gold in small but continuous
                     quantities."<ref target="#CH5-n50">50</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> coins in question, which are eastern, or at least not Italian, make up a small series with a highly distinctive
                  style of portraiture with a chrismon superimposed on the emperor's cuirass. <name type="pname">Lafaurie</name>
                  <ref target="#CH5-n51">51</ref> and <name type="pname">Hahn</name>
                  <ref target="#CH5-n52">52</ref> have followed <name type="pname">Kent</name> in assigning them either to Thessalonica or at least to the
                  Illyrican prefecture. The series began, in fact, under Arcadius.<ref target="#CH5-n53">53</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Lafaurie</name> identified three varieties, the first with <hi rend="bold">AVGGG</hi> (for Arcadius), the second with <hi
                     rend="bold">AVGG</hi> (for both Arcadius and Honorius), and the third with <hi rend="bold">AVGGG</hi> and a star added in the field (for
                  Honorius), which corresponds with <name type="pname">Hahn</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</name>, 53a.
                  There is a fourth variety in the same style of engraving, but in the name of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius
                     II</name> (<name type="pname">Hahn</name> 52a). The chrismon has been interpreted in the light of a text attributed to Quodvultdeus, bishop
                  of <name type="place">Carthage</name>, which tells how Arcadius received a sign of victory against the Persians. As his soldiers were going
                  into battle, crosses appeared on their garments. Afterward he commanded that a gold coin should be struck, bearing this same sign of the
                  cross.</p>
               <p>It is a matter of conjecture which has somehow become enshrined as fact that the crucigerous coins with <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> and those
                  with <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> follow each other in a continuous series, as <name type="pname">Kent</name> suggested and Hahn endorsed. Yet
                  the coins with the two different mint marks are not by the <pb n="81"/> same hand. Those marked <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> are not in the
                  distinctive style of portraiture, and they do not bear the chrismon on the cuirass. Why, then, have the former been so confidently assigned to
                  Thessalonica?</p>
               <p>Lafaurie, while preferring to see the coins with the cross as "probably <name type="place">Thessalonican</name>" (1973), offered in an earlier
                  article (1963)<ref target="#CH5-n54">54</ref> the hypothesis of a third mint, "dont les �missions sont rigoureusement parall�les × celles de
                     <name type="place">Constantinople</name> et de Thessalonique." Given that the coins are not western, i.e. Italian or Gallic, this of course
                  has implications for the theory that <hi rend="italic">monetae auri</hi> are strictly palatine. Lafaurie does not shy away from the
                  difficulty: "Cette permanence fait plut�t penser × un atelier, dont la stabilit� est attest� pour une quinzaine d'ann�es, qu'� un atelier
                  itin�rant. On remarquera particuli�rement que, si le bouclier que tient l'empereur est toujours orn� × <name type="place"
                     >Constantinople</name> par un cavalier qui parait �tre l'empereur chassant, × Thessalonique, pour la m�me p�riode, le bouclier est orn�
                  d'une Victoire, distinction qui individualise les produits des deux ateliers concurrement avec la marque de revers. II est possible de penser
                  que la croix chrism�e caract�risee un trosi�me atelier...." To this argument, it should merely be added that the Victory at Thessalonica is
                  normally a naval Victory, as she has her foot on a prow,<ref target="#CH5-n55">55</ref> and that this detail is very much a temporary feature
                  of the mint's issues.<ref target="#CH5-n56">56</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There are only two recorded provenances for the <hi rend="italic">Cruces in vestibus</hi> series. One is a small hoard from <name type="place"
                     >Asturias</name>, in which there was one specimen along with Italian and Gallic issues, concealed ca. 408-10. The other is a hoard believed
                  to come from <name type="place">southern Tunisia</name>, in about 1958, which considerably enriched the body of surviving materal.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n57">57</ref> These two provenacess are already a considerable obstacle to an Illyrican attrbution.<ref target="#CH5-n58"
                     >58</ref> Dare one say that the obvious attribution is <name type="place">Carthage</name>? Alone of the imperial Byzantine mints, its coins
                  are characerizedd by a prominent cross or chi-rho on the cuirass after being recovered from the Vandals in 533; and Quodvultdeus was bishop of
                  Carthage.</p>
               <p>The dating of the series must rest, in default of better hoard evidence, on the assumption that <hi rend="bold">AVGG</hi> and <hi rend="bold"
                     >AVGGG</hi> were (as was still the practice at that date)<ref target="#CH5-n59">59</ref> used correctly. <hi rend="bold">AVGG</hi> should
                  refer to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</name> and <name type="pname">Arcadius</name>, 395-402, <hi rend="bold"
                     >AVGGG</hi> or <hi rend="bold">AVGGG</hi>* to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</name>, <name type="pname"
                     >Arcadius</name>, and <name type="pname">Theodosius</name>, 402-8, and AVGG* to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_honorius"
                     >Honorius</name> and <name type="pname">Theodosius</name>, 408 onward. The series thus lasts a minimum of six or seven years. If it is
                     <name type="place">Carthaginian</name>, the natural date at which it might have begun is 398, when the <name type="place">African</name>
                  revolt ended following the defeat of Gildo, the authority of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</name> was reestablished,
                  and there was a period of entente between East and West. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name> remained within the
                  praetorian prefecture of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>-<name type="place">Illyricum</name>-<name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>, and <name type="place">Carthage</name> was not the seat of a prefect. For that reason, perhaps,
                  the mint signature <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> was employed (in what was, in any case, technically a western province).</p>
               <p>No evidence has so far been presented which would justify an Illyrican attribution of the <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> coins of the <hi
                     rend="italic">Cruces in vestibus</hi> style. There is, however, another, stylistically quite separate series of <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi>
                  coins (which were amalgamated by Hahn with the crucigeous series and attributed, along with them, to Thessalonica). These appear to be
                  relatively scarce. They are known for both <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</name> and <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</name>, with <hi rend="bold">AVGG</hi>.</p>
               <pb n="82"/>
               <figure xml:id="fig-13">
                  <graphic url="NS17_077.jpg"/>
                  <p>

               </figure>
               <p>This second small series of <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> coins has a separate (and non-Constantinopolitan) pattern ornamenting the cuirass, in
                  particular a row of dots on stalks (<ref target="#fig-13">Fig. 3</ref>) and a very distinctive picture on the shield, namely a Victory on
                  globus (although on one of the two specimens all that can be seen of the globus are the two dots, one on each side of the Victory's feet).
                  There are two specimens which link <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> and TESOB. One is a coin of <name type="pname">Theodosius</name> in <name
                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</name>, which has the row of dots on stalks ornamenting the cuirass, but in combination
                  with a naval Victory on the shield. The reverse of this coins reads <hi rend="bold">AVGG</hi> and the mint signature is TESOB. The other
                  specimen is in the name of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</name> (Appendix 3, 21) which again has an obverse with
                  elaborate cuirass with a row of dots on stalks. It need not be doubted that it is by the same hand as the <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> coins.
                  The reverse again reads <hi rend="bold">AVGG</hi> TESOB. These two coins show unequivocally that distinctive obverse dies were being supplied
                  from the same workshop to the mint or mints signing <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> and COMOB, and that the obverses were carefully differentiated
                  as regards the ornament on the emperor's shield. They suggest that the second <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> series, at least (that is, the one
                  without cross, but with dots on stalks), is Illyrican. Is it, however, <name type="place">Thessalonican</name>? And if it is, why does it not
                  employ the naval Victory on the emperor's shield ?</p>
               <p>The question next arises whether in terms of stylistic development these <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> coins can plausibly precede, or be
                  inserted into, the <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> series. The coins both of <name type="pname">Theodosius</name> and <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</name> with <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> and <hi rend="bold">AVGGG</hi> (so far as one can make out the
                  fine detail on the shield) have another, and slightly different rare ornament, namely a Victory crowning a diminutive (?) kneeling figure. The
                  specimens which indubitably have a Victory and prow are signed AVGG, and the best of them is from an extremely elegant obverse die. But the
                  Victory is soon replaced, in the <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> series, by the standard ornament of a rider (who is spearing a fallen figure, and
                  should therefore presumably be seen as Virtus <name type="pname">Augusti</name>), and the great majority of the Thessalonican solidi—as also,
                  apparently, all those from Constantinople—are unremarkable. The use of one or another of the three versions of a Victory on the shield forms a
                  brief and thoroughly unusual episode.</p>
               <p>Rather than regard the alternation of <hi rend="bold">AVGGG</hi> and <hi rend="bold">AVGG</hi> as anachronistic (as Hahn was driven to do)
                  should one not try to accept, at least as a working hypothesis, that the formulae were used correctly? If they were, then the known <hi
                     rend="bold">COMOB</hi> coins (with Victory on globus ornament) were struck after the <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> mint signature had been
                  introduced in association with a different Victory ornament. The straightforward interpretation appears to be that the <hi rend="bold"
                     >COMOB</hi> coins are not Thessalonican, but are a parallel issue, from ca. 408 (but the series may begin a little earlier, as will appear
                  in a moment) from a peripatetic mint, presumably in <name type="pname">Illyricum</name>. The contrast between the Victory on globus and the
                  Victory with captive/naval Victory is in that case, in Lafaurie's words, "une distinction qui individualise les produits des deux ateliers
                  concurrement avec la marque de revers."</p>
               <p>A coin from a recut reverse die clinches the argument. The mint signature has been altered on the die, <hi rend="bold">TESOB</hi> being cut
                  over <hi rend="bold">CONOB</hi> or COMOB. Traces of the middle letter, which was probably an M, remain between the E and the S.<ref
                     target="#CH5-n60">60</ref> As the legend ends <hi rend="bold">AVGGG</hi>, the coin offers indirect evidence that the <hi rend="bold"
                     >COMOB</hi> mint was in existence while that ending was still in use. The <pb n="83"/> associated obverse, of <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</name>, has Victory and small (?)kneeling figure very clearly visible on the shield<ref
                     target="#CH5-n61">61</ref>—certainly not a prow. The general style of the imperial bust (ornament of the cuirass, etc.) conforms to the
                  later coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</name> with <hi rend="bold">AVGG</hi> and TESOB.<ref target="#CH5-n62"
                     >62</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The shield ornament is a crux: if <hi rend="bold">TESOB/AVGGG</hi> and <hi rend="bold">AVGG</hi> are the only issues on which we find the
                  Victory and kneeling captive, then there are real difficulties in arranging the Illyrican <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> and the <hi rend="bold"
                     >TESOB</hi> coins into a single sequence. But when an issue is known only from two or three specimens, an element of uncertainty must
                  remain.</p>
               <p>With that reservation, the pattern seems to be that the <hi rend="bold">COMOB</hi> die cutting workshop occasionally or briefly helped out
                  with dies signed TESOB, and with appropriate obverse dies as well:</p>

               <p>Nothing is recorded in the history of the city of Thessalonica itself which would explain the brief appearance of a very unusual gold coinage,
                  some of it struck from particularly elegant dies. The historical context of the issues is therefore a matter for conjecture; but some comments
                  of a general nature are possible.</p>
               <p>The strategic importance of Thessalonica to the eastern part of the Empire was enhanced whenever East and West were in conflict. The <name
                     type="place">Via Egnatia</name>, along which it was possible to travel from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> to <name
                     type="place">Constantinople</name> in 21 days, had allowed speedy movement to <name type="pname">Alaric</name>, <name type="pname"
                     >Stilicho</name>, and Gainas. <name type="pname">Theodosius</name> would therefore have had no difficulty in perceiving that the security
                  of Thessalonica was a necessary guarantee of the security of the capital. With the break between the two parts of the Empire in early 407,
                     <name type="pname">Stilicho</name> claimed <name type="place">eastern Illyricum</name> for the West and appointed <name type="pname"
                     >Alaric</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">magister militum per <name type="place">Illyricum</name>.</hi>
                  <name type="pname">Anthemius</name>, the pretorian prefect of the East, responded by ordering the fortification of the Illyrian towns, in a
                  law of April 407. At the same time <name type="pname">Stilicho</name> decreed a naval blockade of the eastern Empire. The death of <name
                     type="pname">Alaric</name> and <name type="pname">Stilicho</name>'s delay turned the course of events; but it seems plausible that the
                  Victory coins, dating from some time after May 408, commemorate the completion of public works.</p>

                     reverse dies. The range of styles suggests piecemeal die engraving, with both emperors represented at each stage. More than half the dies

                  <p>Two series were minted at Thessalonica.</p>
                  <p>A. <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS TERRAR</hi>. A stylistically compact group, extremely similar to the neater coins of <name type="pname"
                        >Theodosius</name> of the same type. The mint signature is still TESOB, but the E is not easily distinguished. The 15 specimens (131-45)
                     were from 13 obverse and 13 reverse dies.</p>
                  <p>B. <hi rend="bold">VICTORIA AVCCC</hi> or <hi rend="bold">AVCC</hi>. The standing Victory with cross type makes its first appearance at
                     Thessalonica. The cuirass is now in a different style, being divided by vertical lines into three panels. The mint signature has changed to
                        <hi rend="bold">THSOB</hi>. The ending <hi rend="bold">CCC</hi> has become meaning less, and the significance of the dot (supplementary
                     issue ? second officina ?) is not clear. There are five specimens (146-50), all from different dies.</p>
                  <p>In the sample the number of duplicates is too small for the estimated total of dies to be firm. The calculation yields a figure of about
                     60. This is somewhat lower than the result obtained if we assume a similar survival rate to that observed for <name type="pname"
                        >Theodosius</name>, when the total would be of the order of 100.</p>
                  <p>Marcian struck silver miliarenses at Thessalonica, also with a military reverse: <hi rend="bold">GLOR ORVIS TERRAR</hi>, emperor standing
                     facing, head left, holding spear and shield (see, for example, Münz. u. Med., 19-20 June 1964, 512).</p>

                  <p>There are two (or perhaps three) series of solidi, all with reverse <hi rend="bold">VICTORIA AVCCC</hi> and the mint signature <hi
                        rend="bold">THSOB</hi>.</p>
                  <p>A. Victory standing left with long cross, which matches the standard Constantinopolitan type: there are two varieties, the first with one
                     star in the left field, the other, more plentiful, with two stars. The first variety has a plain cuirass, the second normally shows the
                     cuirass divided into three panels. The quality of the reverse, in particular the careful treatment of the cross held by the Victory,
                     suggests that the two varieties were not concurrent. <hi rend="bold">AVCCC</hi>· occurs as an alternative in both varieties, but is
                     uncommon. One coin, in a style which does not match the rest of the series closely, is of presumed Tunisian provenance. Among 35 specimens
                     (151-85), 31 obverse and 32 reverse dies were found.</p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-14">

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Fig</hi>. 4</p>
                  </figure>
                  <p>B. Consular bust of Leo (Leo was Consul in 458, 462, 466, and 471), reverse with throned figure in consular vestments. This is a
                     specifically Thessalonican type. There are again two varieties, one with one star, the other, less plentiful, with two stars and a broken
                     obverse legend. The folds <pb n="85"/> of drapery over the knees of the seated figure are variously depicted <ref target="#fig-14">(Fig.
                        4)</ref>. The lack of overlap in the styles of the reverses suggests that the two varieties were not concurrent. Hoard evidence would be
                     required to show that they belonged, for example, to Leo's first and second consulships.</p>
                  <p>The more plentiful variety includes a few coins which seem to be by a different hand: the diadem can be straight instead of curved, and the
                     lettering is larger and less regular. The variability of reverse styles among these coins, e.g. in their treatment of the loros and the
                     drapery over the knees, make them appear to be in some sense derivative. They have accordingly been listed at the end of the sequence,
                     along with one or two even rougher and more problematic coins—a specimen from dies possibly of local workmanship has two stars but an
                     unbroken legend. Could they belong to a different consulship? Again, only hoard evidence could tell. Among 25 specimens (187-211), there
                     are 15 obverse and 20 reverse dies. The Victory and the consular types have, prima facie, had distinctly different survival rates. The
                     former may be estimated to be from ca. 125 obverse and 270 reverse dies, the latter from only ca. 23 obverse and 54 reverse dies. Thus we
                     have one Victory coin from about eight reverse dies originally used, but one consular coin from between two and three. Thessalonican coins
                     of either series are sufficiently scarce that the selective melting down of Victory coins in modern times is rather unlikely. In both
                     issues the reverse: obverse die ratio, equal to or in excess of 2:1, marks a change from the 1:1 ratio of preceding issues; and, among the
                     consular coins at least, the figures are statistically significant.</p>

                  <p>The mint mark is now changed to CONOB, and the coins are distinguishable from those struck at the capital by two stars in the reverse field
                     and by the absence of an officina numeral. The reverse type is the standard one. As Basiliscus had used the mark <hi rend="bold"
                     >THSOB</hi>, it is likely that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_zeno">Zeno's</name> Thessalonican coins are all from his second reign. There are two varieties,
                     the cuirass being divided into either three or two vertical panels.</p>
                  <p>The two varieties are evidently chronologically parallel. They are linked by a reverse die. The more careful dies and those on which the
                     cross has an X-shaped bar presumably were first. The coarse outer border of 227 is thus kept close in date to the reign of <name
                        type="pname">Basiliscus</name>, during which its use was normal.</p>
                  <p>Various stylistic differences between the Thessalonican and Constantinopolitan coins are sufficient to show that the dies were not cut in
                     the capital and supplied to Thessalonica: the border panels of the cuirass and of the cloak are dotted at Constantinople but have wavy
                     lines here, and the feathering of the Victory's wing occurs in a number of styles at Constantinople, but is uniform at Thessalonica.
                     Lallemand proposed to attribute to Thessalonica a series of solidi of <pb n="86"/>
                     <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_zeno">Zeno</name> with the reading AVGGT followed by an officina numeral (<hi rend="italic">CENB</hi> 1 [1964], pp. 49-51).
                     This attribution is questionable if only because the series is from a mint with (probably) ten officinae.</p>
                  <p>The 15 coins examined (222-36) are from 14 or 15 obverse and 14 reverse dies, so no accurate die estimate is possible.</p>

                     the bar of the cross is X-shaped, and there is a horizontal panel with a row of dots at the top of the cuirass. The feathering of the

                     made up a second pair, the estimate would fall to ca. 180.</p>

                  <p>Thessalonican solidi are of an obsolete reverse type and are further distinguished by the usual two stars. There are two varieties, <hi
                        rend="italic">MIB</hi> 6 with diadem ties and <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 7 without diadem ties.</p>
                  <p>The obverses are all by the same hand, with the possible exception of 273. The face is broad and heavy, and the shield is broadly
                     triangular, coming to a sharp point. The initial DN of the inscription tends to be out of alignment. An unusual treatment of the cuirass is
                     seen at its most developed on 270, which has an ornamental vertical panel placed centrally. In simplified form it is repeated on 274 and
                     275.</p>
                  <p>The reverses are closely interrelated in style, the Victory's wing being a useful diagnostic detail. An exception is reverse 271 which
                     appears to be from an Anastasian reverse die. One coin, 275, is of very low weight, but is authenticated by its reverse style, although the
                     obverse is irregular.</p>
                  <p>The possible significance of the diadem ties has been discussed by <name type="pname">Hahn</name>. There is however no clear distinction of
                     style and, on the relatively elaborate obverse of 273, for example, one must wonder whether the ties may not have been omitted simply by
                     inadvertence.</p>
                  <p>One obverse die of <name type="pname">Justin</name> has been recut and used by <name type="pname">Justinian</name> (279). There are nine
                     (270-78) or, with the altered die, ten specimens, all from different dies.</p>

                        >Constantinople</name> mint. On the reverse Victory still holds a plain cross instead of a <pb n="87"/> cross with chrismon. The coins
                     are otherwise distinguished only by the absence of an officina numeral and by the lack of a cross on the globus on the reverse.</p>

                        >Constantinople</name>, but there in no officina numeral. The first A in the reverse legend is set vertically on the flan.</p>
                  <p>Tremisses (364-66)</p>
                  <p>

                     coins of Thessalonica. N24 associates an obverse of Justinian with a reverse, without star, probably from the time of <name type="pname"
                        >Justin II</name>.</p>
                  <p>Analysis</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">
                        <hi rend="italic">MIB 21</hi>
                     </hi> and <hi rend="bold">20</hi>. In Hahn's scheme <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 20 is dated to 527-37, and <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 21 to
                     537-42. Since <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 20 is relatively the far more plentiful, this would imply that the minting of gold either ceased
                     very soon after 537, or dwindled to much lower levels. But one may question the sequence, on the evidence both of style and of the Hajducka
                     Vodenica hoard.</p>
                  <p>The obverses would seem all to be the work of one hand. They are mostly untidy, often with staring eyes, and the cuirass is usually very
                     simply drawn, as in <ref target="#fig-15">Fig. 5</ref>.</p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-15">
                     <graphic url="NS17_082.jpg"/>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Fig</hi>. 5</p>
                  </figure>
                  <p>The seven versions in the top row seem to be used almost indifferently, and variant 2 (298-308) probably belongs with them. The more
                     elaborate style of variant 1 (280-97) occurs on a die with small, neat lettering, and a compact and well-modelled portrait which one would
                     be inclined to place at the beginning of the sequence: it is of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 21. The alternative explanation would be that it
                     reflected a sudden effort to improve the quality of the coinage, in or shortly after 537 (in connection with the reform of 538?).</p>
                  <p>An interesting stylistic detail is the curl of hair at the left of the emperor's neck. On the better dies it is roughly circular but on the
                     remainder it is horn-shaped. Both styles are known from earlier reigns, and it is not impossible that there was an alternation within the
                     sequence of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 20; but the natural arrangement would be to keep the two variants separate, and to see 298 as
                     introducing the horn-shaped curl.</p>
                  <p>The Hajdučka Vodenica hoard, dated not long after the introduction of the frontal portrait at <name type="place">Constantinople</name> (<hi
                        rend="italic">MIB</hi> 7, 542 onward on Hahn's chronology) includes only two specimens of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 21, against 10 of
                        <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 20. One might have expected the Thessalonican issues of 537-42 to be relatively more plentiful in the hoard
                     than that, even if the output in those years was on a restricted scale. Most of the 10 specimens of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 20 are dies
                     that stand very close to each other in style, with a horn-shaped lock of hair at the left side of the emperor's neck, and they include four
                     coins from one obverse die, of which two are from a shared reverse die. It would, again, be natural to see those as being among the latest
                     coins in the hoard. But the argument is not conclusive, since one cannot know the particular circumstances in which a single hoard was put
                     together.</p>
                  <p>There is at present no way in which one can judge the course of mint output during the years 527-42. Could the minting of gold have been on
                     such a small scale before ca. 535 (when administrative changes affecting Thessalonica were made) that three specimens of <hi rend="italic"
                        >MIB</hi> 21 are all that are known from the quinquennium 527-32? Or could the omission of the diadem ties have been merely the outcome
                     of carelessness or indifference, with no quinquennial significance? The <pb n="88"/> discovery of a hoard concealed ca. 530-35 is needed in
                     order to resolve the uncertainty. As an interim arrangement, however, <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 21 and 20 have been listed in that order
                     as a single stylistic sequence.</p>
                  <p>The degree of die linkage among the coins may be exaggerated by the Hajdučka Vodenica hoard. Thirty specimens were found to be from 27
                     obverse and 29 reverse dies. The best estimate one can offer is 400 or more reverse dies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">
                        <hi rend="italic">MIB 22.</hi>
                     </hi> The 46 specimens of <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 22 can be arranged into an approximate stylistic order by reference to the number of
                     curls on the emperor's forehead, the depth of the cuirass, and the treatment of the arm holding the globus cruciger. The coins seem to fall
                     into two sequences, reminiscent of Constantinopolitan <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 6 and 7 respectively. The early specimens of each sequence
                     are from more careful and elaborate dies, with more curls and a deeper cuirass, but there is no very obvious continuity into the obverses
                     for the next issue, <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 23 (although see 355). If <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 22 covered a twenty-year period, there
                     was plenty of time for two separate issues, and perhaps the beginning of a third. The following scheme has been adopted.</p>
                  <p>Style A:</p>
                  <list rend="numbered">
                     <item n="1">8 curls and deep cuirass;</item>
                     <item n="2">7 curls and similar cuirass;</item>
                     <item n="3">7 curls, line across throat;</item>
                     <item n="4">6 curls, line across throat;</item>
                     <item n="5">5 curls, line across throat; and</item>
                     <item n="6">5 curls.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Style B:</p>
                  <list rend="numbered">
                     <item n="1">7 curls and deep cuirass;</item>
                     <item n="2">6 curls sometimes with deep cuirass; and</item>
                     <item n="3">Rougher style, 5 curls.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Style C:</p>
                  <list rend="numbered">
                     <item n="1">5 curls.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The letters at the end of the reverse legend, CCC, tend to be larger on coins with obverse style B. The arrangement is, however, still very
                     subjective, and the two sequences might have to be amalgamated into one, depending on future hoard evidence from the 540s or the discovery
                     of reverse die links. It may turn out that there are metrological differences, the earlier coins being more exactly controlled in weight,
                     and the later ones showing a wider spread. And it would not be surprising if the survival rate were higher among the late specimens.</p>
                  <p>The 46 coins are from 41 obverse and 44 reverse dies, suggesting original totals of about 200 obverses and 500 reverses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">
                        <hi rend="italic">MIB23</hi>
                     </hi> and <hi rend="bold">N23</hi>. On the obverse dies for these coins the emperor wears his hair in a straight fringe instead of five or
                     more curls on the forehead. The two reverse dies for <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 23 appear to be by the same hand as <hi rend="italic"
                        >MIB</hi> 22 (314-16) and might even be altered dies cut originally for the earlier coins. The dies for N23 are in direct continuation,
                     again with a fringe, but they introduce something new: five specimens from the same obverse die. More than one interpretation is possible.
                     Either a collapse in output in the final years of <name type="pname">Justinian's</name> reign is marked by a higher survival rate, or a
                     failure in the supply of dies led to this one obverse die being used far more than was normal.</p>
                  <p>Four obverses and nine reverses are recorded among nine specimens. Possibly between 20 and 40 reverse dies were originally used.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">
                        <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 24</hi> and <hi rend="bold">N24</hi>. At present only two tremisses have been assigned to the Thessalonican
                     mint. A complete die study of the tremisses might isolate products of Thessalonica now concealed in the "Constantinopolitan" corpus.</p>

                  <p>A solidus type without the traditional star or stars (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 16, 367-93) is firmly attributed to Thessalonica on the
                     evidence of the hoard of 1948 and of its stylistic connection with the last coins of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>. There is no
                     officina numeral, and the AS in the reverse legend are distinctively aligned.</p>
                  <p>Similar coins read <hi rend="bold">AVCCCS, AVCCCJ,</hi> or <hi rend="bold">AVCCCT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 17, 394-418). Their
                     chronological relationship to the variety without officina numeral is difficult to determine, as the dies are apparently cut by other
                     hands. The reverses, in particular, have normally aligned As and more prominent serifs on the cross and the lettering. The obverses for <hi
                        rend="bold">AVCCCS</hi> and <hi rend="bold">AVCCCJ</hi> are of Constantinopolitan quality, the fringe of hair is continued vertically
                     past the temples, and the garment above the cuirass at the throat preclude their being part of the same sequence as <hi rend="italic"
                        >MIB</hi> 16. The obverses associated with <hi rend="bold">AVCCCT</hi> are either later or, as Hahn convincingly suggests, locally cut
                     replacements. The heavy representation of these otherwise excessively scarce varieties in the Thessaloniki hoard suggests that they are
                     contemporary with, or later than, the coarser dies of the unnumbered sequence.</p>
                  <p>Hahn has attributed two varieties of tremisses found in the hoard to the local mint—one on which the star is omitted (<hi rend="italic"
                        >MIB</hi> N17, 419-22) and another (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> NN17, 423-33) distinguishable from Constantinopolitan issues only by
                     style (the bust is broader and the head is larger). The heavy die linking among the latter variety is a supporting argument.</p>

                  <p>Die linkage in the hoard is such that the hoard sample might be expected to yield an underestimate of the number of dies used in the later
                     part of the series. In all, 27 coins are from 13 obverses, with an implied original total of 17 dies. It would be more realistic to
                     increase the estimate to 20 "equivalent dies." The reverses include only three pairs and yield an estimate of 93 dies. The ratio of reverse
                     to obverse dies thus appears to have been surprisingly high, possibly as much as 4:1 or even 5:1.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 17</hi>. Twenty-five coins, exclusively from the <name type="place">Thessaloniki</name> hoard, are from eight
                     obverse dies, but from 18 reverse dies, suggesting original totals of ten or a dozen obverses and 45 reverses, a die ratio of about 4:1,
                     not dissimilar to the unmarked series. The hoard may in principle be yielding an underestimate but, as the coins are otherwise unreported
                     and of a period when, because of the invasions, one would expect a high loss rate and therefore a reasonably high survival rate, the tally
                     could in fact be a fair sample.</p>

                     reverse dies, implying a conservative estimate (since the hoard may not be a fully random sample) of 30 to 35 pairs of dies, evidently in a
                     1:1 ratio, quite unlike the ratio employed for solidi. Hoards summarily published in the past need to be looked at again to see whether
                     they included any tremisses which would now be attributed to Thessalonica.</p>

                  <p>The <name type="place">Thessaloniki</name> hoard contained four solidi (434, 438-40) of Tiberius II attributable to the local mint by a
                     comparison with the style of the bust found on Thessalonican copper coins. Their <pb n="90"/> distinctive feature is the boldly dotted
                     style of the reverse cross. Their reverse legend ends with S (stigma), which has been interpreted as year 6 (579/80).<ref target="#CH5-n65"
                        >65</ref> Two other specimens (435-36) are known. The six are, apparently, from six different reverse dies, but the implied total of
                     obverse dies is only about a half dozen.</p>
                  <p>There is also a coin on which the legend ends with H, year 8 (581/2, 441), and the same obverse die is used with a Constantinopolitan
                     reverse (442, <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 11). As this variety is not found in the <name type="place">Thessaloniki</name> hoard, its deposit
                     may have been no later than ca. 581. The use of a Constantinopolitan reverse die, belonging to the consular issue (<hi rend="italic"
                        >MIB</hi> 2), makes one wonder whether the mint may not also have obtained the obverse that made the pair, but in default of hoard
                     evidence (and specifically in view of their absence from the hoard of 1948) the attribution of consular coins to Thessalonica still seems
                     highly speculative.</p>
                  <p>A tremissis in the hoard (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> N11, 443) can, like the solidi of year 6, be attributed to Thessalonica by comparison
                     with the style of the copper coinage; and another variant (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> NN11, 444) is probably also from Thessalonica.
                     Whether any of the tremisses in the Barga la hoard are local remains to be seen.</p>

                        >Maurice's</name> accession (591/2, 601/2). They are identifiable only by similarities of style with Thessalonican copper coins. The
                     half-dozen dies that could be checked (445-50) were all different, but the rarity of the varieties makes it unlikely that they were minted
                     in large quantities.</p>
                  <p>There are tremisses (451-57) of three different varieties (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 22, 23, N23) which have been attributed to
                     Thessalonica. The very high incidence of reverse die linkage in an admittedly small sample suggests a reverse to obverse ratio of 1:1 as

                     acquired there,<ref target="#CH5-n66">66</ref> and has peculiarities of style which cannot readily be matched at other mints. The carefully
                     formed letter G at the end of the obverse legend is the most obvious feature. One may draw attention also to the brooch fastening the
                     cloak, the long and widely spaced pendilia, the reading FOC∧∾, and the cross of the crown (not standing on an arch). On the reverse the
                     cross on the globus is tall. The reverse legend ends with an uncertain numeral which might be I, C, or even ϵ. The general style of the

                        >MIB</hi> 7, and the 3 solidi of Maurice are as <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 4B, 5D, and 6E. In hoard C the 3 solidi of <name type="pname"
                        >Justinian</name> are <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 6. Three of the solidi of Maurice are <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 6E and the fourth is a
                     light weight solidus, <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 11E. In hoard D, 2 of the solidi of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> are <hi

                     The hoard of 1934 and what appears to be yet another hoard, briefly described by Kovacević, may be summarized as follows:</p>

            </head>
            <byline>

            <p>Adelson's monograph on the Byzantine light weight solidi, though the first systematic study of that coinage, failed to provide satisfactory
               solutions to the problems surrounding the coins. Subsequent work, while pointing out the deficiencies of his proposals and putting forward
               alternatives, in its turn has reached no conclusive answers.<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> Futhermore, attention has focused largely upon the
               period from <name type="pname">Justinian</name> I to the first decades of the seventh century, while later coins have been relatively neglected.
               This is due in part to their rarity—of some types only a single specimen is known—and in part to the difficulty of access to the material, for
               most of it is in the U.S.S.R. and much is unpublished. Soviet scholars have, to some extent, analyzed the distribution of seventh-century
               Byzantine coins in the U.S.S.R.,<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> but have not, to my knowledge, recognized the peculiarity of the light weight
               solidi. Again, this situation may be largely due to the lack of information, for it is usually necessary to rely on descriptions of varying
               detail, which may or may not be accurate. This study focuses on the distribution of Byzantine gold coins in the steppe zone of <name type="place"
                  >southern Russia</name>, in particular the 20-carat solidi, for this distribution does reveal suggestive patterns and can thus contribute to
               our understanding of the use and purpose of light weight solidi, as well as to our knowledge of the history of <name type="place">southern
                  Russia</name>.</p>
            <p>The list of finds given below relies principally upon that established in Kropotkin's invaluable book on the hoards of Byzantine coin in the
               territory of the U.S.S.R.<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref> and concentrates on gold coins from the reign of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> to that of Constantine IV, with whom the production of 20-carat solidi appears to have come to
               an end. It also largely excludes finds from areas that are not relevant to the present topic, in other words outside the steppe zone of <name
                  type="place">southern Russia</name> and the regions immediately adjacent to it. Where possible, cross-references to <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi>
               3 have been given, and Hahn's classification and dating have been followed. It is assumed that none of the coins discussed represent new types,
               as there are no new types among the coins for which detailed information is available. The first 11 finds are from the steppe and are listed,
               roughly, from west to east.</p>

            <p>Looking in detail at the finds in the Russian steppe, one feature becomes immediately apparent: there is a concentration of finds with coins of
               the 630s and 640s around the lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_565896">Dniepr</name>, from the Ros' to the <name type="place">Black
                  Sea</name>, and, most particularly, near the Vorskla in the region of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_696643">Poltava</name>. Most of
               the coins, where there is sufficient information to permit precise identification, fall into a single decade, from 636 to 646 (following Hahn's
               chronology). The finds are those at <name type="place">Zhabotin</name>, Maistrov, Kelegeiskie khutora, Novye Sendzhary, Maloe Pereshchepino, and
               Maku-khovka, <hi rend="bold">2</hi> through <hi rend="bold">7</hi>, with the cast imitations of the <name type="pname">Constans</name> coins from
               Dnepropetrovsk and the coins in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_696643">Poltava</name> Museum, <hi rend="bold">25</hi> and <hi
                  rend="bold">26</hi>, and, quite possibly, the three finds at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_686875">Zolotonosha</name>, near <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_696643">Poltava</name> and at <name type="place">Nekhvoroshcha</name>, <hi rend="bold">27</hi> through <hi
                  rend="bold">29</hi>.</p>
            <p>Coins earlier than the 630s are rare in comparison: there is just one from <name type="pname">Pechenaya</name>, <hi rend="bold">1</hi>, and ten
               from the finds at Novye Sendzhary and Maloe Pereshshepino—although these occur with later coins, as possibly may be the case at <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_686875">Zolotonosha</name>. At the other end of the period, from no site in this entire region, stretching
               from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_696643">Poltava</name> across the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_565896">Dniepr</name> to the
                  <name type="place">southern Bug</name> and south from the Ros' to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_565896">Dniepr</name> estuary, are
               there known coins later than the first years of <name type="pname">Constans II</name>, 642-46. It may be that the coin from Kelegeiskie khutora,
                  <hi rend="bold">4</hi>, is later, as may be some of the unidentified coins from other finds, but the absence of any coin known to be later
               than 646 is striking. Such later coins as are known (and they are far fewer in number) are all from further east: at Serpovoe on the river Tsna
               in the north, near Kupyansk east of the Oskol, and, principally, in a band in the south from the <name type="place">Crimea</name> to the northern
                  <name type="place">Caucasus</name>.</p>
            <p>The singularity of this concentration is reinforced in other parts of the steppe by the absence of specimens from the last years of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>' reign and the first years of <name type="pname">Constans II's</name> and by their
               comparative rarity in adjoining regions. To the west, the Avar finds of the middle <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</name>
               have yielded coins of Phocas, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> Constantine, <name type="pname">Constans II</name> with Constantine IV, and of Constantine IV
               but, apparently, none of the later 630s or early 640s.<ref target="#CH6-n62">62</ref> Eastward, in the steppe, there are only later coins from
               near <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_703656">Kupyansk</name>, Romanovskaya stanitsa, <hi rend="bold">8</hi> and <hi rend="bold">11</hi>,
               and a copper one from Nizhnaya Duvanka, <hi rend="bold">32</hi>, while by the Kuban', again, there are both earlier and later coins but none from
               the later 630s and 640s, <hi rend="bold">17-20</hi>. In fact the gold coins of the 630s and 640s occur only in the burial in the <name
                  type="place">southwestern Crimea</name> at Pampuk-kai, <hi rend="bold">13</hi>, from near <name type="place">Kerch</name>' or <name
                  type="place">Taman</name>', <hi rend="bold">16</hi>, in another burial far to the northeast in the wooded steppe at Serpovoe, <hi rend="bold"
                  >9</hi>, and in the central <name type="place">northern Caucasus</name>, <hi rend="bold">22</hi>,<ref target="#CH6-n63">63</ref> where there
               are coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and his two sons (though none are known of the first years of <name
                  type="pname">Constans II</name>).</p>
            <p>The <name type="pname">northern Caucasian</name> coins, however, are not isolated finds but form part of a series starting in the sixth century
               and continuing into the eighth; indeed, coins of Phocas and the first two decades of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius"
                  >Heraclius</name>' reign are much more common than those of the 630s. If the imitations of and impressions made from solidi are included, this
               pattern is reinforced. Then, after only a couple of specimens of <name type="pname">Constans II</name> with Constantine IV and from the latter's
               reign, coins or imitations become more common with the reign of <name type="pname">Tiberius</name> III Apsimar, the
               second reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> II and that of Leo III. The fluctuations described above are clearly connected with the
               liveliest periods of Byzantine relations with the region, such as the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>'
               Persian campaign or the dealings of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> II and Leo III with the <name type="place">Khazars</name> and <name
                  type="place">Alans</name>.</p>
            <p>Excluding the <name type="place">northern Caucasian</name> coins, there remain only the coins from <name type="place">Kerch</name>' or <name
                  type="place">Taman</name>', <hi rend="bold">16</hi>, Pampuk-kai, <hi rend="bold">13</hi>, and Serpovoe on the Tsna, <hi rend="bold">10</hi>.
               It is significant that the latter are from a cemetery dating from the seventh or eighth century, and that a number of objects there have <pb
                  n="120"/> parallels in finds from the seventh century in the south.<ref target="#CH6-n64">64</ref> This raises the possibility that the
               Heraclian coins were also brought from further south and since they were, in any case, found with coins of Constantine IV, it is likely that they
               were buried considerably later than the coins from the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_565896">Dniepr</name> and around <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_696643">Poltava</name>.</p>
            <p>A second feature linking most of the finds from the <name type="place">Dniepr-Poltava</name> area and further differentiating them from finds
               elsewhere is the presence of the light weight solidi, indeed their overwhelming preponderance compared with full weight specimens. Of the coins
               from the period 632-46 that can be identified, 66 are of 20 carats and only 6 are full weight. Of the coins from the other regions, that of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> from Pampuk-kai is full weight, as is at least one of those from the northern <name
                  type="place">Caucasus</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n65">65</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The precise chronological span covered by the coins from the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_565896">Dniepr</name> and near <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_696643">Poltava</name> provides a key to explain their occurrence, for they coincide exactly with the period
               of close relations between Byzantium and the "Great Bulgaria" of <name type="pname">Kubrat</name>. The coins of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and his sons, all crowned, are particularly suggestive. To follow the dating adopted by Hahn,
               the earliest and most common of this class to be found in <name type="place">southern Russia</name> are those of the year 637/8 from Maloe
               Pereshchepino, and this is just about the time that <name type="pname">Kubrat</name> staged his revolt against the Avars—according to the
               patriarch <name type="place">Nicephorus</name>—and entered into a firm alliance with <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius"
                  >Heraclius</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n66">66</ref> This event is not dated precisely by the chronicler, but is sandwiched between events of 634
               and late 639 or 640; there is no good authority for the commonly accepted date of 635, which derives from the suggestion of de Boor.<ref
                  target="#CH6-n67">67</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_nikephorus">Nicephorus</name> adds that <name type="place">Kubrat</name> received gifts and was honored with
               the dignity of <hi rend="italic">patrikios.</hi> Could the coins of 637/8 have been part of these gifts? Even if the letters in the field on the
               reverse of these coins cannot be accepted as an indictional date, this does not substantively affect the correlation. The coins must then be
               placed in the period from 4 July 638, when Constantine Porphyrogenitus says that Heraclonas became co-augustus, to 641.<ref target="#CH6-n68"
                  >68</ref>
            </p>
            <p>To continue with the coins from Maloe Pereshchepino, by far the best documented find, the second largest group is that of <name type="pname"
                  >Constans II</name>, of 642-46. Could these be connected with a bribe from the new emperor—a "gift" designed to forestall any further Bulgar
               interference in Byzantine politics and to establish good relations between the two rulers once Martina and her sons had been removed from power?
                  <name type="place">Kubrat</name>, it was rumored in <name type="place">Constantinople</name> (according to <name type="pname">John of
                  Nikiu</name>), had supported Martina against <name type="pname">Constans</name> in their contest for supreme power in Byzantium and had
               planned to intervene actively on her side.<ref target="#CH6-n69">69</ref> The coins from the intervening years, 639-41, could perhaps have been
               sent as part of a series of annual gifts to cement the relationship between <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and
                  <name type="place">Kubrat</name>, or even as the salary, or <hi rend="italic">roga,</hi> to which the dignity of <hi rend="italic"
                  >patrikios</hi> theoretically would have entitled the latter.</p>
            <p>As for the earlier coins, leaving aside one of Maurice and two of Phocas which could have reached the steppe some time earlier,<ref
                  target="#CH6-n70">70</ref> the six coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> minted between 629 and the <pb
                  n="121"/> start of 632 stand out in the context of the <name type="place">Pereshchepino</name> find, being both earlier and of full weight. To
               pursue the suggestion advanced, could these have been brought back by <name type="place">Kubrat</name> or his entourage when he returned from his
               childhood in <name type="place">Constantinople</name>?<ref target="#CH6-n71">71</ref>
               <name type="place">Kubrat's</name> dates and career remain controversial,<ref target="#CH6-n72">72</ref> but this passage in <name type="pname"
                  >John of Nikiu</name> implies strongly that his stay in <name type="place">Constantinople</name> took place in the reign of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>, and a return home in 631 or 632, as the coins could suggest, would fit with events in the
               steppe. From 630 the Turkish empire in the east began to collapse, triggered by the revolt and death of Mohotu in 631, while in the west Avar
               power had been greatly weakened by the disastrous outcome of the Avars' siege of <name type="place">Constantinople</name> in 626.<ref
                  target="#CH6-n73">73</ref> It could well have been in Byzantium's interest to allow <name type="place">Kubrat</name> to return home to the
               steppe as part of an effort to turn the new developments to its advantage. The years from 632 to 637/8 (637/8, the year of the alliance between
                  <name type="place">Kubrat</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> that the coins would suggest) would be
               the period when the Bulg�r ruler was expanding his authority, as is reported by <name type="pname">John of Nikiu</name>, and asserting his
               independence. Then in 637/8, once this was achieved, he put his relationship with <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius"
                  >Heraclius</name> on a new footing. The coins of <name type="pname">Constans</name>, as described, close this short series, but it is
               impossible to be certain whether this can be connected with <name type="place">Kubrat's</name> death. The date most commonly given for his death
               is ca. 642, but this is not based on any decisive evidence: neither <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_nikephorus">Nicephorus</name> nor <name
                  type="pname">John of Nikiu</name> is explicit, Theophanes' chronicle offers no help, and the "List of Bulgarian Princes" has been interpreted
               as showing that <name type="place">Kubrat</name> died both ca. 642 and ca. 665.<ref target="#CH6-n74">74</ref> There are good reasons for
               believing that his death occurred later than 642, and it is as possible that the cessation of coin exports to the steppe was linked with a shift
               in Byzantine policy as much as with any event north of the <name type="place">Black Sea</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n75">75</ref>
            </p>
            <p>One problem with the proposed correlation between this series of coins and the Great <name type="place">Bulgaria</name> of <name type="place"
                  >Kubrat</name> is that of geography. The obvious implication of the relevant passages in <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_nikephorus"
                  >Nicephorus</name> and Theophanes is that Great <name type="place">Bulgaria</name> lay beyond the Azov and reached south to the Kuban'.<ref
                  target="#CH6-n76">76</ref> Some scholars, using the geographical excursus in Theophanes, extend its frontiers to include the <name

                  >Kubrat's</name> domain to have been east of the <name type="place">Azov</name>. The fact remains, nevertheless, that there is no other people
               or state with which the coins may be linked, and the correlation between this series of coins and the history of Bulgar-Byzantine relations
               appears too neat to be coincidental.</p>
            <pb n="122"/>
            <p>It is possible that all the coins reached <name type="place">southern Russia</name> simultaneously under <name type="pname">Constans

               all sent at the same time. Maybe the coins minted in 638/9 and in 639-41, of which we have only a few specimens (though the Maistrov find, 3,
               tantalizingly suggests there may have been more), did come at the later date, but this seems less probable with those of 637/8 which form by far
               the most common coins. A further fact argues against this hypothesis, too—the rarity of the coins. The two 2 1/2 solidus coins are unique, and
               one of the Heraclian 20-carat coins (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 67) is known only from Maloe <name type="place">Pereshchepino</name>.<ref
                  target="#CH6-n80">80</ref> It is unlikely that these coins, struck in very limited numbers as only one pair of dies seems to have been
                  used,<ref target="#CH6-n81">81</ref> would have been minted in 637/8 and then held in <name type="place">Constantinople</name> until sent out
               in the reign of <name type="pname">Constans</name>; this is even less probable in the case of the two coins minted between 629 and January 632.
               What is likely, however, is that the issues of all these light weight solidi were small, for other die links have been observed. Of those which
               have been studied, in addition to <hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 67, the other Heraclian coin of 637/8 (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 66) has two
               obverse dies and four for the reverse, in four combinations, as does the <name type="pname">Constans</name> coin.<ref target="#CH6-n82">82</ref>
               This suggests that the coins were struck in limited amounts, but at frequent intervals, to meet a regular need; and the very specific grouping of
               these coins, in both time and place, indicates that the selection of coins was not random and raises the question of whether they were produced
               specifically for shipment to <name type="place">Kubrat</name> and the Bulgars.</p>
            <p>In his study of the Byzantine light weight solidi, <name type="pname">Adelson</name> concluded that the 20-carat denomination was introduced to
               facilitate Byzantine trade with the west; certainly the find spots of coins minted in the period from <name type="pname">Justinian</name> to the
               middle years of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> are predominantly in <name type="place">southern Germany</name>,
               along the <name type="place" corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name> to <name type="place">Frisia</name>, and in <name type="place">eastern
                  England</name>. <name type="pname">Adelson's</name> conclusion was amplified by <name type="pname">A. Lewis</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n83"
                  >83</ref>
               <name type="pname">Grierson</name>, while agreeing that the coins were concentrated in Germanic areas, remains quite unconvinced by this line of
               argument but points out that the denomination could fit with a Germanic weight standard, three shillings of 20 grains being equivalent to a
               20-carat solidus.<ref target="#CH6-n84">84</ref> These explanations hardly suit the Turkic (or Alan-Bulgar, as some would have it) context of the
                  <name type="place">southern Russian</name> steppe. It may also be significant that 20-carat coins of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> I
               have been found in two sites in this area: one being the coin possibly included in the burial at Kelegeiskie khutora, 4, the other being a find
               of 50 coins from Beloyarovka, near <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_713504">Amvrosievka</name>, <name type="place">southeast of

                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> there <pb n="123"/> remains a break, with very little Byzantine gold of any kind being found in
               the Russian steppe and no light weight solidi, so there are insufficient grounds for at once supposing any particular association with the
               steppe.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Lewis</name>, pursuing a link between these coins and Byzantine trade policies, has suggested that the switch from west to
               east in the distribution of coin finds in the middle of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>' reign marks an attempt
               by the Byzantines to tap the trade of <name type="place">northern Europe</name> by a new route, after routes further west had been closed, and to
               divert trade from the Sasanian or Islamic world toward the Byzantine ports on the <name type="place">Black Sea</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n86"
                  >86</ref> Unfortunately, there is no evidence to show that the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_565896">Dniepr</name> route was open at
               that time and the indications are that the route from the east to the Baltic did not become important, if it was open at all, until the very end
               of the eighth century.<ref target="#CH6-n87">87</ref> Such trade as there was between north and south probably went up the <name type="place"
                  >Volga</name>, perhaps via the <name type="place">Caucasus</name> first, to the Kama-Vyatka region, where Byzantine vessels and coin are
               found. But these are of silver, not gold, whereas relatively little silver plate comes from the steppe and, as mentioned, no silver coin;
               conversely, there is no gold in the north.<ref target="#CH6-n88">88</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Adelson</name> had explained the change in the distribution of finds by suggesting that the later coins of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and those of <name type="pname">Constans</name> II might have been used for trade with <name
                  type="place">Russia</name>, but a trade in the form of exports of jewelry to the peoples of the steppe, and he wondered if the coins were not
               minted specifically for conversion to such ornaments.<ref target="#CH6-n89">89</ref> This explanation is equally unsatisfactory, for the crudity
               of the jewelry sets it apart from pieces of definitely Byzantine manufacture found alongside the coins, and the skills of the nomads were
               certainly more than adequate for the task of adapting the coins and mounting the cabochon stones that most probably filled the settings now on
                  them.<ref target="#CH6-n90">90</ref> Furthermore, many of the coins were not exactly made into items of jewelry, but simply pierced. There can
               be little doubt that the transformation was made locally, after the coins had reached the steppe. It seems unlikely, too, that the coins were
               traded as bullion, as were the later Kufic coins, quite apart from the fact that such exports were theoretically forbidden.<ref target="#CH6-n91"
                  >91</ref> However, given the parallel established between these coins and the relationship of <name type="place">Kubrat</name> with <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> (which also excludes the possibility that the coins were booty), there is no need
               to assume that they had any commercial purpose or were anything other than gifts from the emperor in <name type="place">Constantinople</name> to
               the ruler of Great <name type="place">Bulgaria</name>.</p>
            <p>This position is reminiscent of the theory that linked the issues of light weight solidi with the tribute paid by the Byzantines to the Avars.
               This theory is not tenable as it stands because the first coins antedate the Avars' arrival in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe"
                  >Europe</name> by some fifteen or twenty years, and any link with the Avars is made more doubtful by the fact that only one find is known from
               within their <pb n="124"/> homeland, as has been detailed by <name type="pname">Adelson</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n92">92</ref> Despite this, the
               idea that light weight solidi should be linked with payments to "the barbarians'' remains current, especially in the case of the 20-carat
               denomination. <name type="place">Grierson</name>, for example, believes this may have been their purpose, and Hendy would certainly consider it
               one of the uses for these coins.<ref target="#CH6-n93">93</ref> If payments were made to the barbarians in this light weight coin, it would be
               most improbable that the Avars did not receive it, in which case the puzzling distribution may be explained with the idea that it was passed on
               in trade by the Avars.</p>
            <p>In favor of the tribute or the payments abroad theory is the presence of <name type="pname">Justinianic</name> coins in <name type="place"
                  >southern Russia</name>, for these could have had nothing to do with trade or any other contacts between Byzantium and the Germanic world. On
               the contrary, it is tempting to link them with the payments made by <name type="pname">Justinian</name> in the 550s to the Kutrigurs and the
               Utigurs, the peoples that then dominated the steppe north of the <name type="place">Black Sea</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n94">94</ref> The
               potential savings for the treasury deriving from the substitution of light weight coinage for that of full weight are evident, but only if such
               payments were calculated in numbers of coins and not by weight. In at least one later case this was indeed how they were calculated, for the
               amount that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> promised to pay the Avars in 623 is expressed in terms of
               solidi—200,000 of them in fact.<ref target="#CH6-n95">95</ref> Yet it is hard to imagine that simple fraud was the motive for any such use of
               light weight coins, for even barbarians would have seen through such attempts at deception. As has been often noted, the light weight coins are
               clearly distinguished from standard solidi, and none of the barbarians were so isolated from Byzantium as to have been for long unaware of the
               difference. So this would not provide a very satisfactory explanation of the origins of the 20-carat coinage, let alone the other denominations
               of 22 and 23 carats.</p>
            <p>The alternative suggestions for the origins of these coins are that they were minted for internal purposes (for instance as an economy measure to
               reduce the empire's wage bill)<ref target="#CH6-n96">96</ref> or as part of a broader plan to augment its revenues by fiscal measures, such as
               proposed by Hendy. He compares the sixth- and seventh-century coins with the tetartera of the tenth century and other light weight coinages,
               while allowing that they may also have been used to make payments abroad.<ref target="#CH6-n97">97</ref> But these hypotheses do not really
               explain why three denominations of light weight solidi were used and continued over such a long period nor, most particularly, do they account
               for the great irregularity with which the 23 and 20-carat types seem to have been minted in the seventh century. For the 23-carat coins we know
               of issues covering the period 603-35, none from the later years of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>, three issues
               of <name type="pname">Constans II</name> of 648/9, then four very large issues from 652-54. After these there is a single issue of Constantine
               IV, of ca. 674-80, and the series ends under <name type="pname">Justinian</name> II with a somewhat larger issue from the years 685-87.<ref
                  target="#CH6-n98">98</ref> For the 20-carat coins we have specimens covering most of the reign of Phocas and of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> up to ca. 625. However, one of the issues for the period ca. 616-ca. 625 (perhaps the later of
               the two, since the mint mark <hi rend="bold">BOXX</hi> is continued with the coins of the later 630s) is exceptionally abundant (<hi
                  rend="italic">MIB</hi> 65).<ref target="#CH6-n99">99</ref>
               <pb n="125"/> After that there is a gap until the coins of ca. 637-ca. 646 of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>
               and <name type="pname">Constans II</name>, which form the main subject of the present article. Last are a few issues of <name type="pname"
                  >Constans II</name> from ca. 662-ca. 667 and of Constantine IV from the periods 669-ca. 674 and ca. 674-80.<ref target="#CH6-n100">100</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In contrast to the irregularity of these seventh century issues, those of the sixth century, from the start of the coinages (<name type="pname"
                  >Justinian</name> I for the 20-carat coin, Maurice for the 23-carat) up to the first half of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius"
                  >Heraclius</name>' reign, seem to make a continuous series, although one 20-carat issue of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> I (<hi
                  rend="italic">MIB</hi> 15, of 542-62) and the 23-carat coins of Maurice (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 11, of 583-602) are noticeably more common
               than the others.<ref target="#CH6-n101">101</ref> The same is true for the 22-carat coins, issued from ca. 538-641 (there are two specimens from
               the few days in 578 when <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and <name type="pname">Tiberius</name> II reigned
               jointly); of these it is the coins of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> from 567-78 (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 8) that are the most
                  common.<ref target="#CH6-n102">102</ref> It should also be noted that the 22-carat series is the only one minted outside <name type="place"
                  >Constantinople</name>—there are regular issues from Ravenna and, later, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>—with the
               possible exception of a 20-carat Alexandrian issue of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n103">103</ref> The proposal put
               forward by <name type="pname">Hahn</name>, that the light weight solidi were introduced to facilitate the equation of gold and copper coins at
               the times when the latter were being revalued,<ref target="#CH6-n104">104</ref> could meet this objection of irregularity, but the correlation
               does not always appear wholly convincing.</p>
            <p>An internal, fiscal reason for these coins would provide a plausible explanation for their origin, but the problem with such a theory has been
               the extreme paucity of finds within the frontiers of the empire as compared with the numbers outside. Kent's view that such inferior coins would
               not have been retained, but would have left the empire, is surely insufficient; they may have been different from coins of full weight, and
               perhaps not too acceptable as currency, but they were still gold. Hendy comments that the distribution could be misleading because, if the weight
               of the light weight solidi did fit with the standards used by the "barbarians," those coins could have gravitated toward them, thus leaving only
               full weight coins within the empire.<ref target="#CH6-n105">105</ref> This could be an explanation, but begs the question of whether any such
               correlation was pure coincidence.</p>
            <p>Some such sorting mechanism could have been at work among the coins from the Nikertai hoard of ca. 680 from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>. Morrisson has shown that the average weight of the solidi is close to 23 carats, yet all except four
               were full weight coins, and the four exceptions are of 23-carat denomination.<ref target="#CH6-n106">106</ref> Their weight compares with that of
               the Islamic dinar, a coin of some 22.5 Byzantine carats, which began to be minted a few years later, and which was based on the standard of the
               Syrian or Arabian carat, a little heavier than that of Byzantium: one dinar equalled 20 of these Syrian carats.<ref target="#CH6-n107">107</ref>
               The coins from Nikertai, including the light weight solidi, could then have been selected to fit with the local standard. Morrisson would also
               consider the coins to be representative of those then in circulation, showing that the Arab conquest of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> did not curtail the arrival of new coin. A contrary impression, however, is given by the Arab-Byzantine
                  <pb n="126"/> gold coinage, which copies much earlier types of Phocas and Heraclius, in other words of the period prior to the Arab conquest,
               and the standard of which approximates that of the normal Byzantine solidus, implying that those were the coins that remained current in the
                  region.<ref target="#CH6-n108">108</ref> If that is so, the Nikertai coins must represent a stock specifically imported from Byzantium.</p>
            <p>Certain peculiarities in the distribution of the light weight solidi are hard to explain by means of a sorting mechanism as suggested by Hendy,
               and, in addition, more coins are now known from within the frontiers of the empire. The following list does not pretend to be complete, but may
               serve to indicate the pattern of distribution. To continue with the 23-carat series, coins of Maurice (MIB 11) are known from <name type="place"

            <p>While it is certainly premature to draw definite conclusions from this summary list, it is worth pointing out that certain patterns seem to be
               indicated. There are finds from within the empire, especially of the 22-carat coins–in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>,
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, North <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>, the northern <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name>, and perhaps <name type="place">Cherson</name>, though none as yet from <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> or <name type="place">Turkey</name> (the coins from the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_istanbul">Istanbul</name> collection do no more than indicate that possibility). Most of the provenances of the 23- and
               22-carat denominations, however, are in the east, especially in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, and for 23-carat ones,
               perhaps in the <name type="place">Caucasus</name> as well; there are fewer from the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name>
               or elsewhere, though the presence of such coins in some <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>an collections suggests there
               may have been more. The distribution of the 20-carat coins, on the other hand, is rather different: coins from Justin II to Phocas are in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, like those of the other denominations; but those of Justinian I and of Heraclius are all
               to the north and west of Byzantium, and this pattern is reinforced by the high proportion of other examples in collections from the same
               regions.</p>
            <p>The finds from within the empire do lend some support to those who propose an internal explanation for the light weight coins, but it should be
               noted that the distribution is far from uniform. Many of the finds are from the frontiers or from zones of disputed territory, places where one
               might indeed expect to find coin hoards; but this also means that they cannot for certain be claimed as "Byzantine"—for the 23-carat coins of
               Heraclius from Yugoslavia.<ref target="#CH6-n130">130</ref> Further, the finds in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> appear
               to form a series that continues after the Arab conquest, the 22-carat (and 20-carat) coins of the period of Justin II to Maurice being replaced
               by 23-carat ones from the reign of Maurice to that of Constans II. Given the proportion of known finds of these types from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, it is tempting to agree with the suggestion that they had <pb n="128"/> some particular connection with
               that region.<ref target="#CH6-n131">131</ref> But if that is so, the fact that Italian mints issued 22-carat coin demands some further
               explanation. It seems most improbable, however, that any such mechanism can account for the very localized distribution of the series of coins
               that are the primary focus of this study.</p>
            <p>To return to the 20-carat coins of the 630s and 640s, the evidence presented above indicates that they were used as gifts from Heraclius and
               Constans to <name type="place">Kubrat</name>. This begs the question of whether this was not also their purpose. The coins are rare and their
               distribution specific—the only finds are from the lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_565896">Dniepr</name> and around <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_696643">Poltava</name>, and only four other specimens are known, three from the Hermitage in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_498817">Leningrad</name>, one from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_berlin">Berlin</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n132"
                  >132</ref> The variety of issues within such a short space of time (even if the indictional datings are not accepted) and the presence of
               close die links within the three issues studied (but not, it seems, between them) suggest that there was a regular series of issues, but that
               each was only minted in limited quantities. If, therefore, the purpose of these coins was to fulfill some internal function, whether of a fiscal
               nature or anything else, and new issues were regularly needed for that purpose, why were they sent abroad so soon after being minted ? The
               obvious answer is that they were minted precisely for sending abroad. The appearance of the full weight coins in southern <name type="place"
                  >Russia</name> would then be anomalous, but the present ratio of the one denomination to the other is so much in favor of the 20-carat coins
               that those of full weight may perhaps be considered adventitious, especially if the earlier coins of Maurice, Phocas, and of Heraclius with
               Heraclius Constantine are excluded.</p>
            <p>Although the distribution of the coins of the 630s and 640s suggests that they were gifts, it does not necessarily follow that this was the
               purpose of all earlier issues of 20-carat solidi. The hoard from <name type="place">Beloyarovka</name>, and the quantity of other Justinianic
               coins in collections in central and eastern <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> do, at least, suggest the possibility that
               the denomination may have been the traditional one for making payments to the barbarians of the north—to the Kutrigurs and Utigurs, to their
               successors the <name type="place">Avars</name>,<ref target="#CH6-n133">133</ref> and then to the Bulgars. Could the first issues have been
               provoked by the great Bulgar (Kutrigur?) invasion of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name> in 540? Admittedly, this
               offers no reason for the choice of the denomination (unless some may be found in the Hunnic or Turkic world), and if the apparent link with a
               Germanic standard is real and the first issues precede the Bulgar invasion, perhaps they could be linked with payments to the Germanic peoples of
               the middle <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</name>, such as the Lombards. Although there is no reason why the coins could
               not have been minted for some internal purpose and then used at once to make payments abroad, it is certainly suggestive that large numbers of
               these coins should have left the empire so soon after being produced.</p>
            <p>For the period from Justin II to Maurice, the validity of this theory appears more doubtful, for the few finds are all in the eastern part of the
               empire, in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, and the issues are more poorly represented in the collections of <name
                  type="place">Russia</name> and <name type="place">Central Europe</name>. Also a 20-carat coin seems to have been minted at Alexandria under
               Justin II. Phocas' coins, too, are found in the east, but more occur in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>an collections.
               For the reign of Heraclius (up to ca. 625), however, the finds are again all in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>.
               Furthermore, given that the fourth issue of Heraclius from this period (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 65) is so very much more common than those of
               the preceding emperors, it is remarkable that no finds are known in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, in fact from
               anywhere except the barbarian parts of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>; the same applies also to the most abundant
               issue of Justinian I (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 15).</p>
            <p>There is also some correspondence between the dates when the early seventh-century coins were issued—in this period, fortunately, they may be
               more precisely dated than most of the issues of the sixth century—and the changing fortunes of the conflict between Byzantium and <pb n="129"/>
               the <name type="place">Avars</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n134">134</ref> In 604 Phocas made peace with them, and thereafter paid them tribute in
               gold; the first known issue of his 20-carat solidi dates most probably to 604, the other two to 610. Heraclius continued this policy, and the
               first two issues of his coins cover the period 610-ca. 616. But in 623, after his narrow escape from the Avar ambush, he was forced to buy peace
               with a vastly increated tribute of 200,000 solidi in order to continue with his Persian campaign.<ref target="#CH6-n135">135</ref> With the
               outbreak of hostilities before the great Avar siege of <name type="place">Constantinople</name> in 626, the payments would have been suspended,
               never to be resumed. This coincides with the coins of Heraclius' class 2b, of ca. 616-ca. 625, after which no coins are known until the issues of
               637/8 and later. The first issue of this class (<hi rend="italic">MIB</hi> 64) is quite rare; the second <hi rend="italic">(MIB</hi> 65) is more
               than seven times as common, and was struck in eight officinae whereas both earlier and later issues of this denominations are from only a
               few—usually only the fifth, ε.<ref target="#CH6-n136">136</ref> Does this difference reflect the emergency administrative measures taken to meet
               the sudden demand for the 200,000 solidi? This type also introduces a change in the mint mark, from <hi rend="bold">OBXX</hi> to <hi rend="bold"
                  >BOXX</hi>, but it is not clear what significance this may have: the mark <hi rend="bold">BOXX</hi> was retained on the coins of 637/8 and
               638/9, but for those of 639-41 and for the first issue of Constans II <hi rend="bold">OBXX</hi> was brought back, only to be replaced again by
                  <hi rend="bold">BOXX</hi> on the later coins of Constans and those of Constantine IV.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, then, the current distribution of the 20-carat solidi of Justinian I and of the period from Phocas to Constans II and the
               correlation of the issues with historical events in the relations between the Byzantine empire and the peoples of the <name type="place"
                  >Russia</name>n steppe and of Pannonia point unmistakably to the fact that the coins were minted in order to be sent as tribute, bribes, or
               gifts to buy peace from and ensure good relations with the barbarians on the empire's northern frontier. Whether this was their original purpose
               it is impossible to say for certain, and this use does not necessarily exclude other ones—other uses must, indeed, be invoked to account for the
               distribution of the coins of the second part of the sixth century and their presence in the empire's eastern provinces.</p>
            <p>Nothing definitive may be said concerning the 20-carat coins issued later in the reign of Constans II or during that of Constantine IV due to
               their extreme rarity: currently only two or three specimens are known of the Constans issue of ca. 662-ca. 667,<ref target="#CH6-n137">137</ref>
               and only one each for the issues of Constantine IV of mid-669 to ca. 674, and between then and 681.<ref target="#CH6-n138">138</ref> But given
               the fact that only one of the coins is not in a <name type="place">Russia</name>n collection (a coin of Constans II now in Dumbarton Oaks) and
               that another of the Constans coins seems to have been found at Chemburko, near <name type="place">Anapa</name> on the coast of the <name
                  type="place">Black Sea</name>, it may be that these issues had a function similar to those of the 630s and 640s.</p>
            <p>Unless some significant finds of these later coins are made, it is unlikely that much more may be inferred about their uses or purpose, but it
               may be expected that new discoveries and further study of the material in the collections of the Soviet Union, and elsewhere, will reveal new
               specimens of other, different issues of light weight solidi that will enable firmer conclusions to be drawn. In particular, one hopes that such
               work may confirm (or modify) the validity of the proposals made here for the 20-carat solidi of the 630s and 640s. If their association with
                  <name type="place">Kubrat</name> and the Bulgars is substantiated, it will provide a key to the interpretation of the other objects from <name
                  type="pname">Maloe Pereshchepino</name>, and from related sites, which are of crucial importance for our understanding of the archaeology and
               the history of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>an steppe.<ref target="#CH6-n139">139</ref>

                  the coins on pp. 17-18 and 35-36, treating them as part of a chain made in imitation of Byzantine "ceremonial" or "marriage" chains. He notes
                  (thanks to <name type="pname">M. Mackensen</name>) that the Constans II coins are of 20 carats and, from their date, would place the <name

                  rather on the plate and jewelry. He identifies (esp. pp. 38-45) the find as the grave of <name type="place">Kubrat</name> himself, making
                  explicit what is only implicit in the present article. For different arguments, building on those expressed here, but independently reaching

                  type="place">Ravenna</name>

            <p>The method used here is a form of wet chemical analysis, the dithiazone method, which has been applied elsewhere several times,<ref
                  target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> but Has also been questioned<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> because its results frequently conflict with results
               obtained using other physical methods. Although no fallacies in the chemical methods have been found yet, a project to investigate a larger
               series of Byzantine gold coins struck in western mints has been suspended for the present. Nevertheless, the results of the analyses already done
               need not be suppressed. They may either be confirmed or modified by future research.</p>
            <p>The following list contains 20 eighth-century gold coins from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> and four of <name
                  type="place">Ravenna</name>, with an addendum of three silver pieces. The analyses have been done by R. Mauterer at the Institute of Inorganic
               Chemistry of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</name> University. As the mint attributions for the gold coins are certain and
               the datings in most cases given by indictional years in the legends of the coins, the irregularity of the purity of the Roman manufacture is most
               strikingly demonstrated. Repeated efforts to halt the debasement of the gold coins seem to have failed, presumably because of a growing shortage
               of that precious metal.</p>
            <p>The three silver coins from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> have been added for comparative purposes. Their dating is less
               certain because the monograms on the reverse have been variously interpreted.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref> All three appear to be papal
               strikings. One, DOC Constantine V 44, should be attributed to Pope Constantine (708-15), and another (BMC 66) is also of Pope Constantine. The
               third, DOC <name type="place">Leo</name> III 92, should be attributed to Pope Gregory II (715-31) or Gregory III (731-41).</p>
            <p>Despite questions about the reliability of the dithiazone method, the fluctuations in purity of the Roman issues in the troubled eighth century
               are apparent. Additional analyses are needed to define more precisely the peaks and troughs in the purity of manufacture. C. Morrisson has
               published results for Sicilian and <name type="place">Carthaginian</name> gold<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref> obtained by proton activation
               together with a few microchemical results. Her results show discrepancies, but they are not as broad as the results here, although she does point
               out the differences in the silver to copper ratio. The results for one coin have had to be recalculated, the Syracusan semissis of Tiberius II
               (698-705, MIB 39). It was reported as Au 75.8%; Ag 7.4%; Cu 16.52%. After revision, the contents are Au 74.8%) Ag 22.1%, Cu 2.5% and Pb 1.6%.
               Another coin can be added to her listing, a Syracusan tremissis of Justinian H's second reign (705-11, MIB V22):<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> Au
               78.8%, Ag 12.1%, and Cu 9.1%. This last example is particularly of interest in that Oddy used the same coin in a test for specific weight.
               Assuming an alloy of gold and silver), then the gold content would be 87.3%; assuming a gold and copper alloy, then the gold content would be
               91.8%.</p>

               </head>
               <p>All the coins were analyzed using the specific gravity method which has received much publicity in recent years.<ref target="#CH8-n1">1</ref>
                  It has also previously been used by other scholars to study the composition of later Byzantine gold.<ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref> The method
                  is easy and is completely non-destructive. It also has the advantage of sampling the whole coin. However, it has the disadvantage of only
                  being accurate for binary alloys (i.e. mixtures of gold with only one other metal) and towards the end of the series in both <name
                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> and Sardinia it is clear that both silver and copper are alloyed with the gold.
                  Nevertheless, for the purpose of studying debasement, the technique is indicative of general trends if not of exact values.</p>
               <p>Until debasement becomes severe it is fairly safe to assume that only gold and silver are present in any quantity and that the analysis
                  results for the gold content are within about 2% of the true value. In fact, Oddy and Blackshaw have shown that for binary gold/silver alloys
                  the maximum error is from -1 to +3% of the true value for the gold content. In view, however, of the wide application in recent years of
                  instrumental techniques of analysis, such as x-ray fluorescence or radiation induced activation methods, it may be asked why such an
                  apparently archaic method as specific gravity is still being applied. The answer lies in the speed of the fact that it can be carried out in
                     <hi rend="italic">situ</hi> in coin cabinets, and the fact that it is quite adequate for the aim of the research which was to follow the
                  debasement of the series.</p>

               <p>Before discussing the debasement of the provincial Byzantine series it is necessary to establish what was the gold content of "pure" gold in
                  this period. This rather paradoxical statement <pb n="136"/> arises because gold invariably occurs in nature alloyed with other metals from
                  which it has to be separated by a process of refinement. In antiquity the methods used to refine the gold were never completely successful, so
                  "pure" gold always contained some alloying elements—usually mainly silver. Various studies have shown that up to the end of the ninth century
                  the gold coinage of <name type="place">Constantinople</name> was not debased and consisted of almost pure gold.<ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref>
                  In fact, the gold of this mint almost always lies within 4% of absolute purity and it is reasonable to assume that this represents "pure" gold
                  as far as the technology of the period is concerned.</p>
               <p>Specific gravity results on a random selection of coins from the mint of <name type="place">Constantinople</name> are represented in the
                  Table, from which it can be seen that all contain more than 95% gold, with an upper limit of about 98%. The median figure is 96.5% and the
                  average of the results is 96.4%, hence consideration of the amount of debasement must be made by substracting the measured gold content from
                  96.4% instead of from 100%.<ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref>

               </head>
               <p>The gold coins of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</name> mint at this period were very small and very thick, a characteristic shape which they
                  had assumed gradually during the reign of Heraclius And his predecessors. They are sometimes dated by letters in the reverse inscription, but
                  this is not invariably the case. The solidi of Constans II fall into six classes,<ref target="#CH8-n5">5</ref> corresponding to those at <name
                     type="place">Constantinople</name>. Of the ten coins analyzed for this reign (see <ref target="#fig-17">Figure 1</ref>), eight of them are
                  unalloyed, and only a solidus of class Ie and a rare semissis fall below 95% gold. The solidus appears to be <pb n="137"/> perfectly normal
                  and the low gold content must be attributed to carelessness in refining the gold, rather than to deliberate debasement.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-17">

               </figure>
               <p>Under Constantine IV, more than half the solidi analyzed fall below the "pure gold" level, two of them by an amount which is unlikely to be
                  accidental. <name type="place">Grierson</name> has divided the solidi of <name type="place">Carthage</name> into four classes,<ref
                     target="#CH8-n6">6</ref> but only III and IV are represented in the British Museum. The two coins which contain 80% (BMC 41) and 87% (BMC
                  42) gold are a problem. Stylistically there is nothing to suggest that the 80% coin is irregular, but the composition must raise the question
                  as to whether it should be regarded as either a contemporary forgery or, perhaps, an Arab imitation. As far as the 87% coin is concerned there
                  is slight evidence in this case that the coin is a copy. On the reverse the indictional letter Z has been transferred from its usual position
                  to the right of the cross potent to the top of the staff held by the figure of Tiberius, where it replaces the usual cross. This mistake,
                  together with a gold content of 87% perhaps suggests that it might be another Arab copy.<ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref> How far these tentative
                  suggestions can be substantiated will only emerge when more of these <name type="place">Carthaginian</name> solidi have been analyzed. It is
                  important to stress that these remarks are based only on a limited study of the British Museum material, together with that in the Dumbarton
                  Oaks and Bibliothèque National catalogues, but <name type="place">Grierson</name> did suggest in 1950<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> that
                  certain members of class II are Arab copies. Although he has since <pb n="138"/> changed his mind about the coins in question, it would now be
                  wise to check on their gold content, as it may well emerge that Arab or possibly Berber imitations are more numerous at this period than has
                  been realized.</p>
               <p>Under Justinian II solidi of <name type="place">Carthage</name> are rare and the British Museum only contains one which may be dated to 695
                  A.D., the year of the fall of <name type="place">Carthage</name> to the Arabs. It is significant, in the light of the above remarks, that this
                  coin has a gold content of 96% at a time when the hard-pressed Byzantines might be excused for allowing the quality of the gold to fall.</p>
               <p>It is assumed that the mint of Sardinia was started up in the early 690s before the fall of <name type="place">Carthage</name>, and it is
                  interesting to find that the coins of the first reign of Justinian II are of good gold because in both <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> at this time significant debasement
                  had taken place. Under <name type="place">Leo</name>ntius <name type="place">Carthage</name> was retaken for a few months but no coins are
                  known from this reoccupation, nor are any gold ones known of Sardinia. Gold was coined, however, at Sardinia under Tiberius III and, although
                  only two coins are available in the British Museum, it seems likely that the gold coatent of 95% and 90% represents a definitive debasement
                  rather than incompetent refining. If this is so, composition may possibly be used as dating evidence for the various types, of which <name
                     type="place">Grierson</name> has listed four according to the symbol in the reverse field left.<ref target="#CH8-n9">9</ref> Obviously
                  further specimens of these solidi must be analyzed in order to test this hypothesis.</p>
               <p>The output of the mint of Sardinia ceased in the early eighth century. DOC ascribes no coins to it for the reigns of Philippicus and
                  Theodosius III and only one solidus for the reign of Anastasius II.<ref target="#CH8-n10">10</ref> The latest coin available for analysis was
                  a fraction of a solidus of the second reign of Justinian II. This exceedingly rare coin has a gold content of 88%, providing further evidence
                  for the decline in gold standard at Sardinia in the closing years of that mint.</p>
               <p>Although the examples are few, especially for the later years, it may be concluded that the minting of gold in the regular <name type="place"
                     >Carthaginian</name> mint continued using essentially fine gold right up until the fall of the city to the Arabs, and it is probable that
                  coins which fall significantly below 95% are to be regarded as contemporary forgeries or imitations. Minting in Sardinia started using the
                  same alloy, but after the first few years there is definite evidence for debasement, although how low the gold content had fallen by the time
                  the mint had closed is not possible yet to say. However even though the gold content of these coins had been lowered by alloying, it was still
                  greater than the gold content of the contemporary coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> and <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name>. The overall picture for the fineness of the coinage of <name type="place"

               </head>
               <p>The coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> is also reasonably straightforward as far as debasement is
                  concerned, and <ref target="#fig-18">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the analytical results from the reign of Constans II until the end of that of
                  Basil I. During the reign of Constans II, when the regular mint at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</name> began striking on a large scale, all except one of the available
                  solidi contained more than 95% gold. The fractional coinage had a slightly greater tendency to fall below 95%, but the amount is not
                  significant.</p>
               <p>During the reign of Constantine IV less gold seems to have been coined in the mint of Syracuse than in previous years. All the coins available
                  for analysis range between 93.4 and 94.8% fine, indicating a definitive drop in quality since the previous reign. Whether this is an
                  intentional <pb n="139"/> debasement by half a carat is impossible to say with certainty on the basis of so few results but it seems possible
                  that it is.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Figure 2 clearly shows that during the reign of Justinian II there was a debasement at the mint of Syracuse. <name type="place"
                     >Grierson</name> had classified the gold coinage according to the symbol in the reverse field, pointing out that Z, H, and θ could be a
                  date sequence, but if so K and *K are anomalous.<ref target="#CH8-n12">12</ref> It might be possible to arrange the coins in a chronological
                  order based on the analyses, but with so few coins available it is only possible to suggest the order which may need some rearrangemant after
                  further analytical studies.<ref target="#CH8-n13">13</ref> The danger of reading too much into a single analysis is illustrated by considering
                  the four Sicilian solidi of <name type="place">Leo</name>ntius. Their gold content ranges from 84.5 to 87.5%, suggesting that their intended
                  fineness was in the range 21� to 22 carats. If these are representative of the norm for the short reign of <name type="place">Leo</name>ntius,
                  then a semissis of Justinian II with a gold content of only 79% must be regarded as exceptionally low. Two solidi of <name type="place"
                     >Leo</name>ntius of type a, without symbols in the reverse field, have a gold content of 87%, while two solidi of type b, with four pellets
                  and a letter I in the reverse field, have a gold content of 84 and 86%; whether type b is consistently less fine than type a is impossible to
                  tell from these few results.</p>
               <p>For the period from 700 to 720 A.D. the results on the available Sicilian gold coinage show a general decline in gold standard which follows
                  that of the Italian mainland at the same time but which is not in line with the gold standard of the mint of Syracuse in the period 720 to 820
                  A.D. The coins of Tiberius III, Philippicus, and class I of <name type="place">Leo</name> III are credited to <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> on the basis of provenance, especially that of the so-called Sicilian Hoard.<ref target="#CH8-n14"
                     >14</ref> It is a great pity that no Sicilian <pb n="140"/> coins of the second reign of Justinian II, Anastasius II, or Theodosius were
                  available for analysis, but the general picture of these twenty years seems fairly clear with a gradual decline from 84% gold down to 60% in
                  the first years of <name type="place">Leo</name> III. <name type="place">Grierson's</name> visual examination of the coins led him to put the
                  low water mark of this debasement in the second quarter of the eighth century<ref target="#CH8-n15">15</ref> with a revival under Constantine
                  V, but the evidence here indicates that this is a little late and that the coinage was reformed soon after the start of the reign of <name
                     type="place">Leo</name> III.</p>
               <p>In fact, from the inception of the class II solidi of <name type="place">Leo</name> III the gold content was raised to about 80%, as can be
                  seen from Figure 2. The change in style from class I is rather abrupt and DOC attributes them to Syracuse on the grounds of provenance and
                  stylistic affinities to the copper series. The analytical results support the attribution to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily"
                     >Sicily</name> because, although the change in style is accompanied by a surprising increase in the gold content of the coinage by 20%, no
                  mint on the Italian mainland could have been producing coins of such a fineness at this time. None of the coins which are attributed to <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> and to the other Italian mints, apart from those of class I, have finenesses in excess of
                  60% and the contemprorary gold coinage of the Duchy of Beneventum fell from about 80% in the first few years of the eighth century to about
                  50% in the 730s.</p>
               <p>The same spread of results, with a mean gold content of about 80%, continues under Constantine V. No coinage of Syracuse in known for <name
                     type="place">Leo</name> IV or Constantine VI and only very rare solidi for Irene. The next Syracusan coins are of <name type="place"
                     >Nicephorus</name> I, which were clearly struck to the same standard as those of Constantine V. Four coins of Micheal I have similar
                  analytical results, the two members of class I having a gold content of 81% and the two members of class II having somewhat lower content,
                  about 77%. Under <name type="place">Leo</name> V the gold coinage is again divided into two classes, all available specimens of which had a
                  gold content from 77 to 79%.</p>
               <p>For a century the gold coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> remained at a constant standard, but during the
                  reign of Michael II a debasement was started which was complete by the reign of Michael III. The earlier coinage of Mitcheal II ranged from 75
                  to 77% fine, but by the end of his reign it had fallen to between 69 and 71%. However, the picture is not very clear as the only available
                  specimen of class II has a gold content of more than 77%, while the four members of class III range from 69 to 76% fine, and the five members
                  of class IV range from 70 to 74%. Although a spread of analytical results over a range of 4 or 5% is not unusual for members of a single
                  class, these results give marginal support to the suggestion in DOC that classes III and IV may have been concurrent issues at separate mints
                  as the political situation on the island was far from stable in the later part of the reign.</p>
               <p>Under Theophilus the available coins of classes I and II had a gold content between 68 and 73%, but the more numerous members of class III
                  have a gold content ranging from 77% down to 30%, many of the more debased pieces obviously containing large proportions of copper. The
                  so-called gold coinage of Syracuse entered its final phase under Michael III. Only semisses are known, and one from each class was available
                  for analysis. Class I follows the issues of the end of the reign of Theopilus, having a gold content in the region of 20 to 30%. The class II
                  specimen has a small amount of gold, and on the basis of these two results it is possible that classes I and II are consecutive. Class III
                  which is firmly dated to the last two years of the reign has no gold, nor have the various specimens of Basil I which continued until the
                  final fall of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> to the Arabs in 878.<ref target="#CH8-n16">16</ref> The overall

               <p>On the Italian mainland the regular mints had ceased production by 780 A.D., but for their last 40 years the so-called gold coins contained
                  little or no gold. The analysis results are illustrated in <ref target="#fig-19">Figure 3</ref> where the different mints (according to the
                  attributions in DOC) are indicated by different symbols. At the first glance Figure 3 looks rather complicated, but several trends are clear.
                  The results for <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> show a steady fall across the graph, as do the results for <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_ravenna">Ravenna</name>, although most of these are confined to the years 685 to 720 A.D. The results for <name type="place"
                     corresp="#viaf_3172394">Naples</name> cover a similar period. Finally there are two groups of results for unidentified mints, one starting
                  about 670 and ending about 695 and the second starting about 705 and ending between 730 and 740. The gap between these two series, if they are
                  series, coincides with the exile of Justinian II.</p>

               <p>Byzantine control over <name type="place" corresp="#viaf_3172394">Naples</name> waned toward the end of the eighth century, although the
                  emperor was still recognized nominally. In the early ninth century there are two groups of large flat solidi, struck in the names of <name

                     corresp="#viaf_3172394">Naples</name>. The first group struck in the names of <name type="place">Nicephorus</name> and Stauracius appears
                  at the right hand side of Figure 3. That they are anomalous can be seen from the fact that they contain 30 to 37% gold at a time when imperial
                  gold coin was otherwise absent in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>.</p>

                  scholars are not in agreement about the attributions of some of the coins. It is possible that careful appraisal of the analyses presented in
                  Figure 3, together with results from other collections, may help to ellucidate some of the problems. Meanwhile the overall picture can be some

                     coins available for study and discussed the results at some length. In addition Michael Hendy willingly gave me access to the Barber
