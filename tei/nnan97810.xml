               <p>Almost every active collector of ancient coins meets from time to time with entirely unknown varieties, or with specimens whose types may present some slight but significant variation. A few such pieces, covering the less well known field of issues produced to the south and east of the Mediterranean Sea, have been chosen at random from his collection by the writer, and here described. To them have been added a few specimens whose types, though rare, are well known, but to which every added example may bring a little further understanding of the series as a whole.</p>
               <p>Perhaps few of the coins presented here can boast of any very great importance in themselves, but it should be the scientific duty of every collector to make available a record of unusual pieces in his possession, in order that existing gaps in our numismatic material may be filled. The writer will be amply rewarded if even one of his specimens should prove of real assistance to some future student.</p>

                  <p>The large and interesting collection of coins, formed during his residence in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> by the late Llewellyn Phillips, M.D., passed after his death into the possession of <persName>Mr. Russell Burrage</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4930956">Boston</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>. The Phillips' portion of <persName>Mr. Burrage's</persName> collection was later acquired by <persName>Mr. Wayte Raymond</persName> of this city. The present writer wishes here to express his appreciation for the permission readily granted by <persName>Mr. Raymond</persName> to look through numerous small boxes in which <persName>Dr. Phillips</persName> had once stored miscellaneous bronze coins and which apparently had not since been disturbed. The majority of these coins were in a more or less badly corroded state and consisted largely of Ptolemaic issues, Alexandrian coinages of the Imperial period, late Roman Imperial of the fourth century A.D., early Byzantine and Arabic coins. Many specimens were so corroded that they were quite illegible, or nearly so. Some of the more promising were cleaned by the writer in the hope of finding unusual or interesting varieties, and the sequel shows that the time thus spent was not entirely wasted. Among the half-dozen Cyrenaic coins found was the following piece, which appears to be an unpublished variety.</p>

not versed in the art of cleaning copper, and because of the coin's shape believed it to be merely one of the early, thick pieces of <placeName corresp="#geonames_8378640">Cyrene</placeName>. He therefore laid it aside. Recently, in clearing out an old box of miscellaneous accumulations, he came across it once more; and having in the meanwhile learned from <persName>Dr. Fink's work3</persName> the best means of cleaning such unpromising material, he proceeded to put it through the electrolytic process. Imagine his delighted astonishment when, after due time, the types gradually appeared and the name of Thibron, that reckless, unscrupulous and ill-starred adventurer, could be clearly read.</p>

                  <p>The story of Thibron is so well known that it hardly requires repetition here. A follower of Harpalos, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>'s absconding treasurer, Thibron first appears on the scene in Crete, whither Harpalos, after escaping from <placeName corresp="#geonames_264371">Athens</placeName>, had led the fleet and army gathered together by the lure of his stolen gold. Thither also came certain political exiles from the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q165198">Cyrenaica</placeName> who joined the
<pb n="5"/>
assembled group of mercenaries, disbanded soldiers and cut-throats, officered by a choice selection of like-minded "gentlemen of fortune." Such a band of adventurers, with all to gain and little to lose, if boldly led could effect much in turbulent times. The news of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> death in distant Babylon had now reached the west. All restraint seemed thus removed; power and wealth lay in the grasp of any bold and persuasive spirit who was willing to dare all and to look not too closely at the means employed. Just such a person was Thibron. He now assassinated his master, and putting himself at the head of the assembled force, set sail for <placeName corresp="#geonames_8378640">Cyrene</placeName> to seek fame, fortune and a kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The district of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q165198">Cyrenaica</placeName> at this time was, as usual, torn by bitter factional strife. The invaders landed, and after varying successes managed to seize Apollonia, the port of <placeName corresp="#geonames_8378640">Cyrene</placeName>, and even to besiege the capital. The towns of Barce and Euhesperides, seeing their chance, joined the marauders. Thibron proclaimed himself king. But fortune was fickle; Mnesicles, one of Thibron's officers, quarrelled with his chief over the spoils and deserted to the Cyrenaeans into whom he fused new courage. Help was also sent from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2468244">Carthage</placeName>, but their combined forces were routed by Thibron who again laid siege to the city. In desperation at this new misfortune, the Cyrenaeans appealed for help to Ptolemy, recently established in his satrapy of <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. The Lagide gladly grasped at this unexpected opportunity to add so wealthy and important
<pb n="6"/>
a province to his dominions, and despatched his ablest general, Ophelias, with a body of troops to the aid of the hard-pressed Cyrenaeans. Ophelias was completely successful, Thibron's army was routed and dispersed, the adventurer himself captured and crucified at Apollonia, and the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q165198">Cyrenaica</placeName> pacified and incorporated with Ptolemy's Egyptian possessions.</p>
                  <p>The types chosen by Thibron for his short-lived coinage are strongly Alexandrine in character, although the style and fabric are clearly those of contemporaneous Cyrenaic bronze issues.<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                        <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                     </ref> The head of young <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> recurs on <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>'s prolific silver and bronze coinages. The scheme of the reverse design is also definitely <orgName type="ethnic">Alexandrine</orgName>, although the usual bowcase is here replaced by the spear head. It is most unfortunate that the monogram or symbol on the reverse remains illegible, thus depriving us for the moment of a possible indication of the mint in which the coin was once struck. <placeName>Apollonia</placeName>, as the base of Thibron's operations against <placeName corresp="#geonames_8378640">Cyrene</placeName>, is a possible suggestion. Euhesperides might also be suggested, for this city coined more extensively in bronze than did Barce, the other Cyrenaic community which had supported Thibron's cause. It was also at Euhesperides where was located the scene of one of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref>' labors, and its mint is
<pb n="7"/>
known to have struck autonomous bronze coins with the Hero's head as their obverse type.<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                        <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                     </ref> But for our particular coin, the choice of types is far more likely to have been due to the widespread influence of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> issues (as is especially suggested by the scheme of its reverse design) than to any merely local reason.</p>
                  <p>The unexpected appearance of a coin bearing the name of Thibron adds another element to the controversy, once so popular among scholars, regarding the person to whom should be assigned the Θιβρώνειον νόμισμα of Photius' <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi>,<ref target="#CH1-n6">
                        <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                     </ref>—whether to Thibron the Spartan harmost of the early fourth century, or to Thibron the adventurer in <placeName corresp="#geonames_8378640">Cyrene</placeName>. The last word had remained with Ernest <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> who argued<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                        <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                     </ref> ably in favor of the former. The other side of the controversy was brilliantly sustained by Théodore Reinach in his <hi rend="italic">L'histoire par les monnaies</hi>, pp. 257–260, where he marshals some telling arguments in favor of Thibron the <hi rend="italic">condottiere</hi> of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s age, as against the Spartan Thibron of the fifth century B.C.</p>
                  <p>One of Reinach's principal arguments is based on a neglected passage in Pollux where the expression Θιβρώνειον (νόμισμα) occurs in the middle of a group of names designating bad or forged coins, in con-
<pb n="8"/>
trast to certain well-known and everywhere acceptable money previously mentioned. Most other commentators had overlooked this particular passage because it occurs in only two manuscripts and was omitted in the best (Bekker's) edition of Pollux. Reinach therefore argues that "Thibronian money" must mean a particularly bad kind of money, probably <hi rend="italic">some fourrée</hi> or debased coins issued by Thibron when in dire need of funds with which to pay his mercenaries. Our coin can scarcely be a specimen of this supposedly "bad" money of Thibron's, for otherwise its types would have imitated some well known coin of precious metal, and not merely a copper coin of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. But so long as no actual coin, bearing the name of Thibron, was offered in evidence, the question remained, at best, rather academic. Today we actually do possess such a coin, and as it comes from the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q165198">Cyrenaica</placeName> and as in types, style and fabric it can only belong to the Thibron of Cyrenaic fame, the scales are now heavily weighted in his favor.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, Photius, or his original sources, would hardly have honored a mere copper coin by mention—but the fact that such a coin actually exists, renders likely a further assumption that silver (and even gold) coins had also once been coined by Thibron. For by the time he arrived in Africa perhaps little remained of Harpalos' stolen five-thousand talents of gold. "Money talks", especially to mercenaries and adventurers of the kind gathered about Thibron; and it would be surprising
<pb n="9"/>
indeed if he had not commenced to coin at the earliest possible moment. He could not have depended merely upon such money as was to be found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_8378640">Cyrene</placeName>. But Ophelias, when he had finally secured the entire province for Ptolemy, would have been at especial pains to gather in all the adventurer's issues and melt them down for immediate recoinage. To date, only one (?) modest copper piece appears to have escaped. Further scientific excavations at <placeName>Apollonia</placeName>, Barce, Euhesperides, or even in our museums, may bring more to light.</p>
                  <p>The discovery of No. 2 seems to save from an apparently undeserved oblivion a similar coin first published by Pellerin, <hi rend="italic">Recueil de médailles de peuples et de villes</hi>, Vol. I, pp. 164-165, Plate XXVI, 13. He there pictures it as having a helmeted head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> on the obverse and on the reverse the letters ΘΙΒΡΩ horizontally placed between a spear head and a club, the reverse thus being identical with that of our own coin. Pellerin assigned the piece to Thibros, a town supposedly in Thessaly<ref target="#CH1-n7a">
                        <hi rend="sup">7a</hi>
                     </ref> and mentioned only by Stephanus Byzantinus after Lycophron. Mionnet in his first edition, Vol. II, p. 24, No. 171, accepts Pellerin's description and attribution, but in the Supplement, Vol. III, p. 308, sees fit to place a query after the name. Perhaps he was led to this hesitancy by Eckhel's sceptical remark concerning the attribution, <hi rend="italic">nescio an satis tuto</hi>, in his <hi rend="italic">Doctrina numorum veterum,</hi> Vol. II, p. 150.
<pb n="10"/>
Sestini, too, felt dubious with regard to the piece, for he mentions it only in the second portion of his <hi rend="italic">Classes generales</hi> which is devoted to uncertain or erroneous attributions. On p. 130 he even says <hi rend="italic">est suspectus</hi>, though it is not clear whether he here refers to the attribution or to the coin itself, probably to the former because, previously, on p. 32, he states that he had seen another similar coin in Cousinery's collection.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi> of the Deutsches archäologisches Institut in Rom, 1839, p. 278, Pl. R, 8, H. Hase publishes a little coin from Baron Stackelberg's collection which he mistakenly likens to the above mentioned piece described by Pellerin and Mionnet. It is, however, merely a misread copper coin of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q187570">Boeotia</placeName> of the fourth century B.C. with a <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> (not <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>, as believed by Hase) head to right on the obverse, and on the reverse the usual club and Boeotian shield accompanied by the letters of a magistrate's name. It is only to this piece that Friedlaender-Weil give a reference in their <hi rend="italic">Repertorium zur antiken Numismatik</hi>, p. 162. In fact, no reference is there given to any other printed discussion of the Pellerin piece; and the coin seems, by this time, to have disappeared completely from scientific literature. Nor does so comprehensive a work as the first edition of Head's <hi rend="italic">Historia Numorum</hi> make any mention of it. Even the many scholars (i. e., Mommsen, Lenormant, <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>, Reinach, and others) who have discussed the Θιβρώνειον νόμισμα ignore or are unaware of so
<pb n="11"/>
promising an object as a coin bearing the letters ΘΙΒΡΩ.</p>
                  <p>That the coin described by Pellerin must have been an actual piece, and not a figment of his imagination, is proved by the remarkable similarity between its reverse type, as pictured on his plate, and the reverse of the coin before us, brought directly from the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q165198">Cyrenaica</placeName>. His specimen differs from ours in its obverse type—an <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> head to r. instead of a <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> head to l. It is possible that his coin may have been so damaged on the obverse that he misinterpreted the design, although he actually describes (p. 165) the piece as <hi rend="italic">bien conservée.</hi> He does not give the size, but Mionnet states it to be 4½ according to his scale—which is also the exact diameter of our piece. The fact that Mionnet alone gives the size suggests that he actually had the coin itself before him, and it may thus still exist in the French national collection. It would be interesting if the authorities of the <hi rend="italic">Cabinet des Médailles</hi> should succeed in rediscovering so interesting a coin. It well deserves being saved from scientific forgetfulness.</p>

                  <p>The presence of this piece among others which had definitely come from the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q165198">Cyrenaica</placeName>, almost presupposes its coinage in that particular district. However, it was not until after cleaning that there became legible the magistrate's initials which so closely link it to the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q165198">Cyrenaica</placeName>. In the quality and details of its style, it is not unlike the Alexandrine tetradrachms correctly assigned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_8378640">Cyrene</placeName> by <persName>Mr. Robinson.8</persName> In this regard, as well as in its inscription which consists of the royal title only, our coin resembles the didrachm of Cyrenaic types given to the reign of Magas, 308–277 B.C.<ref target="#CH1-n9">

Following this suggestion, the letters Εϒ on our bronze coin may be taken as the initials of that mint, rather than those of some magistrate—although the magistrates Εϒ, ΕϒΑ and ΕϒΦΡΙ do occur on other Cyrenaic coins of the last quarter of the fourth century B.C. Finally, it may be remarked, the careful style and neatness of manufacture of our coin point to a somewhat later date than the coin of Thibron, which in this regard more closely resembles the preceding autonomous copper.</p>

                  <p>Its types clearly associate the coin with the similar rare pieces described by <persName>Mr. Robinson,11</persName> but the magistrates' names ΕϒΑ and ΣΩΣΙ are here replaced by the title ΒΑΣΙΛ. This abbreviated title appears to link our piece with the above-mentioned didrachm (Plate I, A) bearing the inscription ΒΑΣΙ and the apple-branch symbol. As previously stated, this symbol has induced <persName>Mr. Robinson</persName> to suggest the assignment of the didrachm to the mint at Euhesperides, while the jerboa-crab coins belong to <placeName corresp="#geonames_8378640">Cyrene</placeName> itself because of the magistrates' names which they bear. Those with the letters ΕϒΑ depict the crab within a dotted circle on the obverse, the jerboa facing to the r. within another dotted circle on the reverse. Our coin, on the other hand, places the jerboa to the l. on the obverse, while the crab lacks the dotted circle and is on the reverse. In these respects, No. 4 exactly resembles the coins with ΣΩΣΙ. In point of fact, the writer is convinced that his coin and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2950159">Berlin</placeName>

specimen, reproduced by <persName>Mr. Robinson</persName> on Plate XXV, 24, of his catalogue, are actually from the same pair of dies. If that be the case, then the letters ΣΩΣΙ must have been misread for ΒΑΣΙΛ. The letters are none too clear in the reproduction, and a further damage to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2950159">Berlin</placeName> specimen at this particular spot renders the proposed emendation highly probable.</p>

                  <p>The great hoard of archaic silver staters, which was unearthed at <placeName corresp="#geonames_146400">Larnaca</placeName> in July, 1933, has considerably enriched the list of known Cypriote varieties and enlarged our knowledge of the island's early numismatic history—thanks to the able description and study of the find made by <persName>Mr. P. Dikaios</persName> and <persName>Mr. E. S. G. Robinson.12</persName> As stated by <persName>Mr. Dikaios</persName>, not all of the pieces found could be secured by the local authorities and many were surreptitiously sent out of the island. Over a year ago, upwards of a hundred pieces from the hoard were brought to the American Numismatic Society by two Cypriotes and offered for sale. No purchases were made as the lot contained no unusual varieties<ref target="#CH1-n13">
                        <hi rend="sup">13</hi>

Their surface corrosion and general appearance correspond exactly with the other coins in the hoard and there is little doubt that they once were in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_146400">Larnaca</placeName> find. Only the two following are worthy of mention here, as they are better preserved than the single specimen described by <persName>Mr. Dikaios</persName> and so furnish us with the means of definitely assigning them to their original mint, Citium.</p>

                  <p>Both coins are from the same dies used for the specimen first published by <persName>Mr. Dikaios</persName>, No. 530, Pl. XV, 8. By a most fortunate chance the flan of No. 5 is slightly larger than usual and, in consequence, has received the complete impression of the obverse die,—more so than either No. 6 or the coin published by <persName>Mr. Dikaios</persName>. This fact now enables us to ascertain definitely that the obverse type does not represent <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref>,<ref target="#CH1-n15">
                        <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                     </ref> as was hesitatingly suggested by <persName>Mr. Robinson</persName>. The full outline of the helmet's crest is quite clear. With such a coin as No. 5 before us, it is also easy to recognize certain characteristic features of the helmet, not only on No. 6 but also on the coin published in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Chronicle.</hi> Therefore we cannot have <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> before us, but must recognize in the helmeted head a probable representation of the giant (Geryon?)—as <persName>Mr. Robinson</persName> at first correctly surmised.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the slightly sharper impression of the reverse die on our coins enables us to secure another bit of information. In his description of the similar stater from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_146400">Larnaca</placeName> hoard, <persName>Mr. Dikaios</persName> says<ref target="#CH1-n16">
                        <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                     </ref> of the reverse: "no trace of possible letter." We can now ascertain that what he doubt-
<pb n="17"/>
less mistook for further portions of the lion-skin behind <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref>' back are actually the Phoenician letters <graphic url="NNM82_023A.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM82_023B.jpg"/> the one above the other. The happy presence of these letters assures us that the mint of these coins must have been Citium. For <graphic url="NNM82_023C.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM82_023D.jpg"/> can hardly be aught else but the initials of <graphic url="NNM82_023E.jpg"/> that is <hi rend="italic">Melek Kition</hi>, King of Citium. This now enables us to assign the entire group,<ref target="#CH1-n17">

                     </ref> of which Nos. 5 and 6 are obviously the final issue, to that important mint, an attribution that the characteristic <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> types of their reverses would presuppose. Thus is bridged that evident stylistic gap existing between the earliest (one-sided) issues<ref target="#CH1-n18">

                     </ref> The striding <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> on the reverse of our coins is the direct prototype of the similar figure which constitutes the obverse type of the vast majority of the coins struck at Citium from Baalmelek I (479-449 B.C.) to Pumiathon (361-312 B.C.). The attribution also modifies the curious anomaly that otherwise a large hoard found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_146400">Larnaca</placeName>, the ancient Citium itself, contained but three specimens of that flourishing city's coinages.</p>

                  <head>DEMONICUS 388–7 B. C.</head>
                  <p>The interesting story of Demonicus, so far as it can be pieced together from our scanty materials, has been most interestingly worked out by Ernest <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n20">
                        <hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                        <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                     </ref> Son of an eminent Athenian <hi rend="italic">emigré</hi>, Demonicus for a short period, and under circumstances we can only guess at, made himself king of Citium. Doubtless this could only have taken place during the years 388–387 B.C. when the Athenian general Chabrias controlled the affairs of <placeName corresp="#geonames_146669">Cyprus</placeName>. In the long series of typically oriental coinages of the Phoenician kings of Citium, the very rare issues of Demonicus distinguish themselves by their fine, free Attic style and the Athenian influence which dictated the character and choice of their obverse types. The scarcity and interest of his coins in general will be sufficient apology for describing the following two specimens, the second of which appears to present an as yet unpublished variety and denomination.</p>

                  <p>The first of these pieces is similar to ones already described by both <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> and Hill. The second piece, however, is entirely new for the issues of Demonicus, both as to its denomination and the details of its types. That it certainly belongs to those issues is proved by its style and fabric, by its choice of types (standing <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> on the obverse, <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> on the reverse), and by the close stylistic affinities between all these figures on the coins of Demonicus, however much their individual poses may differ. Incidentally, the obol reached the author in a lot composed of Cypriote coins exclusively.</p>
                  <p>As is the case with the now famous and practically contemporaneous stater of Timocharis of Paphos,<ref target="#CH1-n22">

                  <p>Early in 1931, there were received from Damascus two of the coins described below, followed a little later by the third. They obviously had come from a single find, as their surfaces were absolutely uniform in appearance: with a thin purplish-black corrosion accompanied by patches of <hi rend="italic">verdigris</hi>. What else the hoard may once have contained, and when or where it had been found, could not be ascertained in spite of a considerable amount of correspondence. Certainly, it had come to light somewhere in northern Syria, but closer than that it was impossible to get. As it seems useless to delay any longer, the three coins are here described in the hope that perhaps some collector or museum official may have additional information at his disposal.</p>

trate's name Άππολόδοτος on the latter, are all familiar. The really novel feature presented by the coins before us, lies in the curious counterstamp which each of them bears on its obverse. These counterstamps were apparently produced by two different punches—one being used for Nos. 10 and 11, another for No. 12. In detail of design, however, they are identical. In a shallow oval incuse is depicted a tall, pointed Macedonian helmet to l., with spike at the top and wide brims below, from which depend two cheek-pieces. The helmet is further adorned, in front, with a tall, curved ibex horn, while beneath the brim may be discerned two fluttering diadem-ends. Above, on the right, is a large letter, <hi rend="italic">beta.</hi> In all Greek numismatics there exists only one helmet which exactly corresponds to this, the well-known helmet with which the Syrian usurper Tryphon adorned the reverses of his silver and bronze coins struck at <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q200441">Antioch</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n27">

                  <p>The counterstamp was probably impressed upon these coins after Tryphon had finally done away with the little <persName>Antiochus</persName> (whose regent he had been) and proclaimed himself king in his stead.<ref target="#CH1-n28">

Whatever foreign coin chanced to lie in the royal treasury was thus stamped with the minimum of delay, to accompany the proclamation of his usurpation. Probably even earlier royal Seleucid money was also counter-stamped, for Tryphon was envisaging a new dynasty; but, if so, none has as yet been recorded.</p>
                  <p>So far as the writer is aware, only one other specimen of this "emergency" issue of Tryphon's is to be found in numismatic literature. Sir George Macdonald has published a tetradrachm of Heraclea, exactly like our No. 11, in his Catalogue of the Hunterian Collection in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1465387">Glasgow</placeName>, Vol. II, p. 345, No. 1, Pl. LI, 2. But the counterstamp on this particular specimen is contained in a square frame. Macdonald described the object as a Macedonian helmet adorned with feathers. The fact that the letter <hi rend="italic">beta</hi> was illegible and the characteristic ibex horn was mistaken for a feather, prevented his recognizing the obvious connection between this object and the special insignia adopted by the usurper Tryphon.</p>

son of Samos, with the Arsabes of Polyaenus and friend of <persName>Antiochus</persName> Hierax (247–227 B.C., mistakenly given by Puchstein as 247–222 B.C.), and supports his belief by the following calculations. The fifth panel of the ancestor series on the East Terrace of Nimrud-Dagh bears the name of Aroandes, son of Artasura, who married Rhodogune, daughter of the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes Mnemon. Now this Aroandes is better known to us from Xenophon and other Greek writers as the Orontes, satrap of Armenia and the son-in-law of Artaxerxes Mnemon, who played a leading part in Persian history in the early fourth century, B.C. As Arsames occupies the tenth panel, Puchstein assumes that he must represent the fifth generation from Orontes and so, allowing the usual thirty years to each generation, supposes his <hi rend="italic">floreat</hi> to have been early in the last half of the third century B.C.</p>
                  <p>So far, everything, the coins, the historical reference in Polyaenus and the ancestor panels of Nimrud-Dagh appear to support each other very well indeed. But a closer inspection of the coins themselves arouses some doubt. Their style and fabric, especially those of our No. 13, appear a little late for the mid-third century. Especially disturbing is the fillet border which surrounds the obverses. On Seleucid coins, this ornament first appears some years after<ref target="#CH1-n41">

                     </ref> the commencement of the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antiochus_ii">Antiochus II</persName>I (223-187 B.C.). It is hardly likely
<pb n="28"/>
that so striking an innovation in a coin design should have first appeared on the issues of a petty king, residing in a mountainous and out-of-the-way canton such as Armenia, only to be later copied on the coinages of the great Seleucid empire. The inverse order is practically certain to have been the true one. In that case, we should perhaps accept Reinach's theory that in the third century B.C. there had actually existed two Armenian kings by the name of Arsames, a father and a son. If the first were the Arsabes mentioned by Polyaenus, then the second, his son and successor, could well have lived in the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antiochus_ii">Antiochus II</persName>I. To this second Arsames might be assigned the coins, which must then be dated not earlier than <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 215 B.C. This date, on the one hand, suits better their style, fabric and the presence of the fillet border, while, on the other hand, it still leaves room for that Orontes, mentioned by <persName corresp="#nomisma_l_vol_l_f_strab_rrc">Strabo</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n42">

                  <p>But, even so, there remains yet another disturbing factor as presented by the coins of Arsames. The form of the king's bonnet seems out of place in the third century B.C. Such bonnets were either

                  <p>At the outset it must be stated that the form, as here given, of this unknown prince's name is far from certain. Only the last four letters, Α Μ Ο ϒ, are clear. Of the first letter in the name, only a right-hand, sloping stroke (\) still exists on the coin. The second letter appears to be an upright stroke enlarged at the top, something like <graphic url="NNM82_036B.jpg"/> which could have been intended for a <hi rend="italic">rho</hi>. The third letter, damaged by corrosion, is very doubtful, but what remains seems to have a form something like <graphic url="NNM82_036C.jpg"/> To read this as a possible <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> is not far from a counsel of despair. From the letters which we have
<pb n="31"/>
before us, some such name as ΑΡΣΑΜΟϒ appears to be the most acceptable reading. The royal title, with its reversed <hi rend="italic">sigmas</hi>, is quite clear. Below the thunderbolt there exist vague traces of further letters, which probably once gave the prince's epithets but which are now, unfortunately, quite illegible.</p>
                  <p>Assuming that the name was once really Arsames, we are unable to connect this coin with any one of the three possible Arsames' mentioned in the preceding section. The style and fabric of No. 14 point to a comparatively late date, certainly not before the second century B.C. Neither they, nor the types, in the slightest degree resemble the known coins of the Armenian Arsames. On the other hand, the portrait head with its curiously tall, pointed bonnet, does remind one of the bronze coins<ref target="#CH1-n53">

                     </ref> There thus seems little doubt but that we have before us a coin of one of these kings.</p>
                  <p>According to extant inscriptions and to coins, the line of the Commagenian kings, from Samos down, is now known.<ref target="#CH1-n59">
                        <hi rend="sup">59</hi>
                     </ref> Our coin must then belong to a predecessor of Samos, and the writer would suggest his father as the most likely. Although one of the Gerger inscriptions<ref target="#CH1-n60">

                     </ref> does give his name, it is unfortunately so damaged by time and plant growths that it is almost illegible. Its publisher, Puchstein, practically admits this.<ref target="#CH1-n61">
                        <hi rend="sup">61</hi>
                     </ref> He tentatively suggests the reading Μιθραδάτου, but the letters as found in his transcript made on the spot hardly bear him out. Reinach<ref target="#CH1-n62">
                        <hi rend="sup">62</hi>
                     </ref> offers a more plausible suggestion in reading the name Πτολεμαίου, and equating him with that Ptolemy who is mentioned in a fragment of Diodorus<ref target="#CH1-n63">
                        <hi rend="sup">63</hi>
                     </ref> as having been <hi rend="italic">epistates</hi> of Commagene under the Seleucid kings and who later revolted. Both readings appear hazardous, according to Puchstein's own transcript.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately the letters of the inscription in question are not arranged <hi rend="italic">stoichedon,</hi> and the lines contain a varying number of letters. Of the eight lines which comprise the inscription, the reading of
<pb n="33"/>
the first six is practically certain as they follow a given formula reproduced scores of times on the inscriptions of Nimrud-Dagh. We thus find that the first six lines of our inscription contain 32, 30, 31, 29, 27, and 30 letters, respectively. The seventh line is badly damaged at the beginning but preserves, sufficiently well, the known epithets of king Samos. The line can thus be restored almost certainly as Βασιλέα Σάμον Θεοσεβῆ δίϰαιον τὸν έϰ, which gives us the title, the name and the epithets of King Samos in 31 letters. The eighth and last line is the most damaged of all. Both Puchstein's and Reinach's readings give us a line of 33 letters,<ref target="#CH1-n64">
                        <hi rend="sup">64</hi>
                     </ref> which is longer than any other single line in the inscription. By substituting Άρσάμου for the Μιθραδάτου of Puchstein and the Πτολεμαίου of Reinach, we would secure a line of 30 letters, which seems slightly more in keeping with the remainder of the inscription. In any case, Άρσάμου would fit the given traces of the original letters about as well (or as poorly), as the readings proposed by Puchstein and Reinach, respectively.</p>
                  <p>If the discovery of a new inscription, or a careful revision, undertaken on the spot, of the old should invalidate the present writer's proposed emendation, then Arsames will have to be considered as perhaps the grandfather, rather than the father, of
<pb n="34"/>
Samos.<ref target="#CH1-n65">
                        <hi rend="sup">65</hi>
                     </ref> In any case, it is not surprising to find the name Arsames re-appearing in the line of the kings of Commagene, who traced their ancestry directly back to the third century kings of Armenia, among whom an inscription proves there had existed at least one, and possibly two, rulers bearing this very name. That an Arsames once ruled in Commagene may be surmised from the name Arsameia, borne by the ancient town in Commagene which is now known as Gerger.<ref target="#CH1-n66">
                        <hi rend="sup">66</hi>
                     </ref> This Arsameia had obviously been the capital and burial place of the Commagenian kings before <persName corresp="#nomisma_antiochus_i">Antiochus I</persName>, who is responsible for the long inscriptions which give us what little information we possess concerning the city. It was thus most intimately connected with the kings of Commagene in particular, and not demonstrably so with any earlier Arsames as king of Armenia.</p>
                  <p>The style and fabric of our coin point definitely to the last half of the second century B.C. Its type of the winged thunderbolt could have been copied from similar Seleucid coins of <persName>Alexander I Bala</persName>

                  <p>So far as the writer knows, this represents a completely new variety to be added to the large number of tetradrachms which were coined through-
<pb n="38"/>
out all <placeName corresp="#geonames_163843">Syria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q11767">Mesopotamia</placeName> in the reigns of Caracalla and his immediate successor, Macrinus. Fortunately, the comparative uncertainty, which usually dogs all attempts to attribute the majority of these tetradrachms to their respective mints, does not impede us in the present case. The interesting reverse type points unmistakably to Neapolis of Samaria as the mint of our coin. For here we find, carefully depicted, the well known representation of the holy mountain, Gerizim, beneath whose shadow, on or near the site of ancient Shechem, had been founded by Vespasian the "new city" of Neapolis, to become in time the modern Nablus.</p>
                  <p>The earliest numismatic representations of the mountain, we find on certain bronze coins of Antoninus Pius.<ref target="#CH1-n74">
                        <hi rend="sup">74</hi>
                     </ref> Their large scale enables us to grasp more clearly all the essential features of the design. We see the two unequal peaks of the mountain,<ref target="#CH1-n75">
                        <hi rend="sup">75</hi>
                     </ref> the taller of which is surmounted by an altar, the lower supports a temple of classic form to which a stairway, flanked by small shrines, ascends from a pillared portico which spans the mountain's base. Similar representations are found on the bronze coins of Caracalla and later emperors. Our coin is
<pb n="39"/>
distinctive, however, in that Mt. Gerizim is placed within a double halo, held aloft by the outspread wings of a Roman eagle. A somewhat similar combination of mountain (but without the encircling halo) and eagle reappears on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_the_arab">Philip</persName> Sr., and continues to the end of the imperial coinage. Eckhel<ref target="#CH1-n76">
                        <hi rend="sup">76</hi>
                     </ref> explains the eagle as being the bird of Zeus, which Sir George Hill<ref target="#CH1-n77">
                        <hi rend="sup">77</hi>
                     </ref> accepts, and points out that "In many oriental representations of Zeus we find him supported by an eagle; here he is replaced by his sacred mountain."</p>
                  <p>This interpretation is on the whole probably correct, though the <hi rend="italic">origin</hi> of the design is susceptible of quite another explanation, thanks to our coin. We start from the fact that the characteristic types of the silver tetradrachms issued by the Romans in such enormous quantities from their provincial capital at <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q200441">Antioch</placeName> had been based, ever since the reign of Nero, on the well known and immensely popular shekels and half-shekels coined at Tyre. These had commenced as royal Seleucid money, imitating the preceding Ptolemaic coinage, and then in 124 B.C. had become autonomous in character and continued as such down to and beyond the middle of the first century after Christ, when the Romans put an end to their issue. In place of the head of Tyrian <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> and the Ptolemaic eagle, the Roman authorities adopted the emperor's portrait and their own varied conceptions of the
<pb n="40"/>
eagle. So closely connected in the popular mind with the old Tyrian coinage were these Roman tetradrachms that, as late as the reign of Hadrian,<ref target="#CH1-n78">
                        <hi rend="sup">78</hi>
                     </ref> they were still known as "good silver of the Tyrian mint,"<ref target="#CH1-n79">
                        <hi rend="sup">79</hi>
                     </ref> even though they were for the most part struck in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q200441">Antioch</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n80">
                        <hi rend="sup">80</hi>
                     </ref> Perhaps for the sole purpose of maintaining this Tyrian fiction, and doubtless pushed thereto by the insistent demands of the general public, the Roman mint authorities in Syria took evident pains to continue the presence of the customary eagle <hi rend="italic">somewhere</hi> on these tetradrachms. For, apparently, the eagle was looked upon as practically an essential feature of this sort
<pb n="41"/>
of money, until the coinage's final discontinuance at the end of the reign of Trebonianus. Thus, in the second year of Vespasian, the portrait of his son Titus suddenly displaces the eagle on the reverse.<ref target="#CH1-n81">
                        <hi rend="sup">81</hi>
                     </ref> But even before the close of this particular issue the eagle reappears, now placed beneath the head of Vespasian.<ref target="#CH1-n82">
                        <hi rend="sup">82</hi>
                     </ref> The same phenomenon occurs later under Trajan whenever Tyrian <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> or the Tyche of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q200441">Antioch</placeName> occupy the reverse side of the coins. In every such case, the eagle is still to be seen upholding the bust of Trajan on the obverse.<ref target="#CH1-n83">
                        <hi rend="sup">83</hi>
                     </ref> Again under Caracalla, whenever the eagle on the reverse happens to be replaced by an imperial portrait or some other type, the royal bird is almost certain to be found beneath the bust,<ref target="#CH1-n84">

                     </ref> either on the obverse or on the reverse.</p>
                  <p>So when the authorities at Neapolis decided, with pardonable local pride, to place a representation of
<pb n="42"/>
their beloved and hallowed Mount Gerizim on the reverse of the tetradrachms ordered by Caracal la to be coined in their mint, they were constrained to incorporate the necessary eagle somewhere in their design. To them, the most logical and artistic location was beneath the reverse design. It was a happy thought to surround the mountain with a circle or halo as a suitable frame to the picture, which was further enhanced by depicting the eagle <hi rend="italic">en face,</hi> thus supporting the entire design with his outspread wings.<ref target="#CH1-n85">

                     </ref> The conception was evidently appreciated by later Samaritan die-cutters who adopted it (though without the halo) on the bronze issues from <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_the_arab">Philip</persName> senior to Volusian. Whatever the scene of the eagle upholding the holy mountain may have been intended to convey esoterically, the first conception of the design was predicated upon the necessity of displaying an eagle somewhere on the silver tetradrachm to proclaim it as άργυρίου ϰαλοῦ Τυρίου ϰόμματος in the words employed by the writer of the Dura parchment.</p>
                  <p>To the mint at Neapolis should perhaps also be assigned the following No. 18, which exhibits a more orthodox reverse type.</p>

                  <p>It should be noted that the rather crude style of the obverse of No. 18 is very similar to that displayed by the obverse of No. 17. Of particular interest is the emperor's bust wearing scale armor, which on both coins is seen from the back. This peculiarity is found, so far as the writer is aware,
<pb n="44"/>
on no other Syrian issues of the tetradrachm under Caracalla, although it does occur at Edessa in Mesopotamia. Other minor details are also similarly handled on the two coins, such, for instance, as the manner of depicting the hair (especially at the nape of the neck), the ear, the form of the diadem ends, the shape of the fold of drapery appearing in the field above the right shoulder, etc. That the former mint of No. 18 may be tentatively placed in Palestine is suggested by these close analogies with No. 17, and by the fact that only at nearby Gaza<ref target="#CH1-n86">
                        <hi rend="sup">86</hi>

                  <p>The tiny mint-symbol beneath the eagle on No. 18 is unfortunately somewhat obscure, but appears to represent a crude, facing figure with arms outstretched. It could almost equally well be intended as some sort of plant or tree with two branching limbs! Its true nature may at least be guessed at by comparing it to the larger symbol beneath the eagle on No. 19. Here we must have a representation of Zeus Heliopolites, with the customary <hi rend="italic">calathus</hi> on his head, the whip in his right hand, the ear of corn in his left, and flanked by his accompanying bulls. Similar coins have been published by

                     </ref> who interprets the figure somewhat differently. He recognizes a <hi rend="italic">harpa</hi> and not the whip in the god's right hand, an uncertain object (which he calls <hi rend="italic">une sorte de broche</hi>, i.e. a spit or spindle) in the left, and two doubtful animals flanking the central figure. He compares this figure with the Baal of Orthosia who is represented on certain late Hellenistic coins of that city.<ref target="#CH1-n89">
                        <hi rend="sup">89</hi>
                     </ref> But there he is depicted in <hi rend="italic">profile</hi> and as holding only a <hi rend="italic">harpa</hi> in his right hand, and in his left, the reins leading to two winged lions which appear to be drawing the car on which the god stands. A far closer analogy may be found on certain common bronze coins of Marcus Aurelius struck at Neapolis in Samaria. Here we find a representation of Zeus Heliopolites,<ref target="#CH1-n90">
                        <hi rend="sup">90</hi>
                     </ref> exactly as he occurs on our No. 19.<ref target="#CH1-n91">
                        <hi rend="sup">91</hi>
                     </ref> On coins such as the latter, the object in the god's right hand has the form <graphic url="NNM82_051A.jpg"/> which is more like a whip than an orthodox <hi rend="italic">harpa</hi>
                     <graphic url="NNM82_051B.jpg"/> as found on the coins of Orthosia. The object in his left can be readily interpreted as an ear of corn, while on the coins of Orthosia this hand holds only the reins. The animals on our coin are certainly not winged, as at Orthosia, where the god is always in profile and not facing as on the above mentioned bronze coins of Neapolis and on our No. 19. In the light of these coins, the obscure figure on No. 18 may also be interpreted as a Zeus Heliopolites. Because the god
<pb n="46"/>
appears on certain bronze issues of Neapolis, and because of definite stylistic similarities between Nos. 17 and 18, the latter piece may plausibly be assigned to Neapolis Samariae.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the present writer would not insist that such coins as No. 19 should also be definitely attributed to that city. The differences in style and obverse inscription between this coin and Nos. 17 and 18 make such an assignment problematical, in our present state of knowledge. But M. Seyrig's proposed attribution to Orthosia seems even more problematical. A far better suggestion, at least in the writer's opinion, would be <placeName corresp="#geonames_277130">Heliopolis</placeName>, where Zeus Heliopolites was held in such particular veneration that he derived his special designation therefrom.</p>
                  <p>In his article, M. Seyrig has pointed out a most interesting distinction between the two forms of obverse inscriptions as they appear on the tetradrachms of Caracalla's fourth consulship. The one formula, ΑᴠΤ.Κ. Μ.Α.ΑΝΤΩΝεΙΝΟС.СεΒ, he shows to have originated in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q200441">Antioch</placeName> and to have been adopted in general by inland cities. The other formula, ΑᴠΤ.ΚΑΙ.ΑΝΤΩΝΙΝΟС.Сε,Β originated in Tyre and was adopted by various coastal cities. There exist, as is usual in any such rule, certain exceptions,<ref target="#CH1-n92">
                        <hi rend="sup">92</hi>
                     </ref> but on the whole the observation seems to hold fairly well. If we assign coins like No. 19 to <placeName corresp="#geonames_277130">Heliopolis</placeName> we find that this city, like

other inland places, followed the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q200441">Antioch</placeName> formula.<ref target="#CH1-n93">

               <p>Until further hoards have been unearthed and studied, and additional scientific excavations made at the innumerable ancient sites of Palestine, little real progress can be achieved towards correctly dividing and assigning to their true mints that ever increasing conglomeration of curious coins, which have been handled in their entirety by Sir George Hill<ref target="#CH1-n95">
                     <hi rend="sup">95</hi>
                  </ref> under the comprehensive title of the Philisto-Arabian series. Meanwhile, the addition of new types, or even minor varieties, to our known material may prove of some help to future scholars wishing to bring coherence and understanding to this baffling but most interesting series.</p>
               <p>Actually, only one considerable hoard of such pieces has been subjected to scientific scrutiny. Mr. Lambert, in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine</hi>, Vol. II, 1933, pp. 1–10, has conferred a real benefit by so carefully describing
<pb n="48"/>
a large group of these coins which were secured by the Palestine Museum in the preceding years. The coins in question appear to have come upon the antiquity market from the general vicinity of Gezer, and at about the same time. They probably constituted a real hoard, but <persName>Mr. Lambert</persName> is careful to state that, instead, they may have been collected singly by the Arabs of the vicinity rifling some ancient site. But as the group forms a coherent whole and as the surface corrosion of the individual pieces seems to have been more or less the same, it is likely that they really constituted an actual hoard. Because the following Nos. 20, 25, 27, 29, 30 and 31 also came upon the <orgName type="ethnic">European</orgName> coin market at practically the same time as those in the Palestine Museum, and because they comprise similar types and are of similar outward appearance, having a very thin, dark corrosion, easily removed, it is probable that they too all originally came from the same Gezer hoard.</p>

                  <p>It is a pity that M. Seyrig did not give the obverse inscriptions of the coins similar to our No. 19.

                  <p>The first of these coins has been re-struck upon a similar(?) coin, of whose reverse type the top of the owl's head, the tail feathers and the end of its wing feathers, may still be made out. Unfortunately, the greater portion of the inscription is off flan, but what remains clearly suggests that it was not once the usual ΑΘΕ, but rather some other inscription, perhaps in Aramaic characters. The coin is distinguished by a neatly made lotus bud placed in the field immediately to the r. of the owl. The style of the coin, while still excellent, has some of the hard dryness usually associated with a copy. The model must have been a late fifth century Athenian obol.</p>
                  <p>Hemi-obols, apparently similar to our No. 27, may be found in Svoronos' <hi rend="italic">Les monnaies d'Athènes,</hi> Pl. 110, Nos. 45–47. The letters ΑΘΕ are still legible and the style of the coin cannot be much later than the very beginning of the fourth century B.C.</p>

                  <p>Both coins appear to be unpublished. The head on No. 30, although that of a bearded man, recalls the obverses of the Athenian coins so popular in these districts. The two dolphins on the reverse of No. 30 may point to one of the many coastal towns in Philistia as the probable mint. In passing, it may be remarked how very rarely objects connected with the sea are pictured on these Philisto-Arabian coins.</p>

                  <p>This interesting little coin was formerly in the collection of <persName>W. Gedney Beatty</persName>, from whom the writer obtained it by exchange in 1927. According
<pb n="61"/>
to the ticket accompanying the coin, <persName>Mr. Beatty</persName> had purchased it in 1905 from <persName>Prof. G. N. Olcott</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5113375">Columbia</placeName> who, in turn, stated that he had acquired it about the year 1902 from a missionary returning to this country from <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. This provenance, and the presence of the letters ΝΑϒ which replace the ΑΘΕ of the original Athenian prototype, indicate that the present obol was actually coined in the city of Naucratis in the Egyptian Delta. It belongs to the same general category as the numerous imitations of Athenian coins reaching us from <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> and Palestine, some of which bear symbols or the names of local mints or officials (usually expressed in Aramaic letters or even Egyptian hieroglyphs) in place of, or alongside, the original ΑΘΕ. The style of our coin, the modelling of the features, and the eye seen in profile indicate that it was copied from an Athenian coin of the first half of the fourth century B.C. It was probably intended to circulate among the Greek merchants and expatriates residing in the famous trading emporium which Egyptian Pharaohs had permitted the <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q539051" type="ethnic">Greeks</orgName> to found at Naucratis. In the excavations of that site many genuine Athenian coins have been unearthed, showing what popularity that type of money had long enjoyed there.</p>
                  <p>In point of time, our obol may have preceded the well known copper pieces (a specimen of which, in the author's collection, is reproduced on Plate IV, B) which beneath the female head of the reverse also bear the letters ΝΑϒ, and which have always been

                  <p>Leaving this knotty problem for the last, let us turn to the other factors in the case, which are of equal importance. Six states<ref target="#CH1-n129">

                     </ref> that no less than four of the seven specimens which he enumerates under his No. 27 came from <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. This indication of the usual provenance of these coins has since been confirmed many times over. About 1907, a hoard comprising about sixty examples of these particular coins was unearthed at Samanoud<ref target="#CH1-n130">
                        <hi rend="sup">130</hi>
                     </ref> in the Delta. No. 36, above, was purchased by the writer in the winter of 1908 at Bedrashin Railway Station, where travellers descend to visit the ruins of Memphis. Either the coin had been found by one of the Arabs living on the site and brought to the stationmaster for disposal to passing tourists, or it had come from the Samanoud hoard. No. 38, above, was secured from <persName>Dr. Schauffler</persName>, who had himself acquired it from <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. During several of his visits to the country of the Nile, the present writer has been

offered other specimens, but all in such poor condition that they were not worth purchasing.</p>
                  <p>Even if we did not thus learn that such pieces almost invariably come from <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n131">

                        <hi rend="sup">133</hi>
                     </ref> and appear to have been widely prevalent only in that country. In other words, coins such as Nos. 36 to 38 circulated principally in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>; and as they are seldom found elsewhere, they were probably coined there as well.</p>
                  <p>This fact appears to be proved by the following observations. In his <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>, Vol. II, p. 635, No. 1026, <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> published for the first time a bronze coin, similar to our No. 39 described above, which bears the inscription <graphic url="NNM82_071C.jpg"/> in Aramaic characters more or less identical with those seen on the imitation Athenian tetradrachms. The writer's specimen came from <persName>Dr. Phillips'</persName> collection. It turned up in one of his boxes containing miscellaneous
<pb n="66"/>
material. Together with a few Ptolemaic and Alexandrian coppers, it was wrapped up in an old piece of paper marked "Myt-Rahineh." Apparently, these coins had been purchased by <persName>Dr. Phillips</persName> at, or sent to him from, Myt-Rahineh, a modern village on the site of ancient Memphis. Our coin was so heavily corroded that it was quite illegible, but a few weeks in the electrolytic bath has restored it almost to its pristine state. Another example, but very badly struck off-centre, was found by <persName>Dr. Fisher</persName> in the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania's excavations at Memphis. Therefore, this particular category of bronze coins may with confidence be assigned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. Because of their obverse type, they must have been coined under Persian domination. Very probably they were actually struck at Memphis, the capital of the country then, and the letter M, seen on the obverse of the specimen published by <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>, was perhaps intended to indicate this mint. With them must go the imitation Athenian tetradrachms bearing the same inscription.</p>
                  <p>In <placeName corresp="#geonames_2968815">Paris</placeName>, in the de Luynes collection, there exists a silver <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q1048468" type="ethnic">Phoenician</orgName> trihemiobol<ref target="#CH1-n134">
                        <hi rend="sup">134</hi>
                     </ref> which is said to bear the same inscription <graphic url="NNM82_072.jpg"/> The types of the coin are Sidonian: obverse, galley to left; reverse, Persian king to right, slaying a lion. But <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>
                     <ref target="#CH1-n135">
                        <hi rend="sup">135</hi>

correctly appreciated that it could only be an imitation of the Sidonian issues and so coined elsewhere—in other words, it is a piece similar to the obol published in the present study, No. 22, as probably having been struck in Palestine. But the inscription of de Luynes' coin associates it definitely with the imitation Athenian tetradrachms and the bronze coin, Nos. 36–39, which we have seen could only have been coined in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. As genuine Sidonian coins are frequently found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n136">
                        <hi rend="sup">136</hi>
                     </ref> they must also have circulated there to a considerable extent. Hence, they might very well also have been imitated there. As a <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q1048468" type="ethnic">Phoenician</orgName> trihemiobol corresponds sufficiently closely in weight with an Attic obol, it could have been struck in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> to circulate alongside the Athenian tetradrachms described above.</p>
                  <p>In recapitulation, then, we possess a large group of imitation Athenian tetradrachms, distinguished by a certain name written in Aramaic characters. Alongside of these, we also possess an imitation Sidonian trihemiobol (Attic obol) and certain bronze coins bearing the same Aramaic inscription. Two of the three known specimens of the bronze coin were found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>, and being of this humble metal were therefore almost certainly struck there.
<pb n="68"/>
The Egyptian origin of the entire group is therefore so extremely probable that it may now be assumed as a fact. The bronze coins bear an unmistakably Persian type, which is also true of the reverse of the Sidonian imitation. It may therefore likewise be taken for granted that these coins were struck under Persian rule. The tetradrachms obviously imitate true Athenian coins of mid-fourth century type. Hence the entire group, silver as well as bronze, can only date from the final Persian dominion over <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>, i.e. from its reconquest by Artaxerxes Ochus in 345 B.C. to its invasion by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName> in 332 B. C.</p>
                  <p>As stated above, all members of the group bear the same inscription in Aramaic characters, an inscription which can only represent some personal name. On the analogy of scores of other Persian issues in <placeName corresp="#geonames_323835">Asia</placeName> Minor and Syria in the fourth century B.C., the name is almost certainly that of some Persian satrap or commander-in-chief charged with raising an army for some particular military expedition. For the period to which we have seen that coins like Nos. 36–39 must be assigned, we possess the names of but two Persian satraps—the Sabaces who in 333 B.C. raised and led the Egyptian contingent to Darius III and perished on the field of Issus; and Mazaces who succeeded Sabaces as satrap of <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> and surrendered the country to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in 332 B.C.<ref target="#CH1-n137">

                     </ref> Again following the analogy of such Persian satraps or generalissimos
<pb n="69"/>
as Pharnabazus, Tiribazus, Datames, Mazaeus and several others who are known to have organized large military or naval forces and, in their own names, to have coined money on an extensive scale to finance their operations, both Sabaces and Mazaces might well be expected to have coined money likewise. For Sabaces raised a considerable force with which to join Darius, while Mazaces, after the <hi rend="italic">debacle</hi> of Issus, rallied and reorganized the Persians and their sympathizers in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> sufficiently to hold down native unrest, guard the eastern frontier at Pelusium, and to fight off and destroy some eight-thousand Greek mercenaries who under ambitious leaders tried to seize the country for their own purposes.</p>
                  <p>On the bronze coins described above, the Aramaic inscription <graphic url="NNM82_075A.jpg"/> is written in particularly clear and carefully formed characters. The inscription on the silver "Sidonian" trihemiobol is partly off flan and so will be disregarded here. On one or two of the better style imitation Athenian tetradrachms, the in scription is also well-formed and gives us <graphic url="NNM82_075B.jpg"/>

                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>, however, accepts Six's reading of <hi rend="italic">waw.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, when analyzed, <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> and Six are in fairly close accord, so far as the actual reading of the letters is concerned. Following these scholars we secure the letters CH-I-V-S, for which Six pro-
<pb n="71"/>
poses a Greek form, Σευίχως. He points out that the <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q539051" type="ethnic">Greeks</orgName> rendered the name of Sabataka, second king of the Egyptian 26th Dynasty, as both Σευίχως and Σεβίχως; while his predecessor's name Sabaka, they render Σαβάϰων. From there, it was but a short step for Six to attribute the coins to Σαβάϰης, the penultimate Persian satrap of <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. As our coins are certainly of Egyptian origin, and as by their style and types they must belong to the last period of Persian rule in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>, i.e. to the very period in which we know a certain Sabaces was satrap of the country, the author (as a numismatist and not a professing philologist) is prone to follow Six's attribution. He is not in a position to judge rightly if <graphic url="NNM82_077A.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NNM82_077B.jpg"/> presents a possible rendering of the name Sabaces, a name, be it noted, that has been transmitted to us only through western writers.<ref target="#CH1-n143">

                     </ref> In the form in which it has come down to us, the name of Sabaces does not seem to possess a particularly Iranian sound or appearance. In this regard, it seems far more Egyptian in character—but would the Persians have dared place a person of Egyptian origin over a province that was ever ready to rebel against their hated domination?</p>
                  <p>The attribution of Nos. 36–39 to Sabaces (or

whatever his correct Iranian name may have been) would seem to gain further support from a consideration of the following pieces.</p>

                     <p>Justi, in his <hi rend="italic">Iranisches Namenbuch</hi>, seems somewhat nonplussed at the name. He prefers Arrian, as the most trustworthy, who gives Σαβάϰης; while Curtius (III, 11, 10 and IV, 1, 28) gives Sataces and Diodorus (XVII, 34, 5) the obviously garbled Τασιάϰης. In passing, it may be remarked, that however blundered the latter form may be, it <hi rend="italic">does</hi> seem to give us the <hi rend="italic">iota</hi> sound corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">iod</hi> of the inscriptions.</p>

                  <p>There exists in various public and private collections a large and well-known group of imitation Athenian tetradrachms superficially similar to No. 40. In fabric, however, they differ radically from the piece here described, and their place of origin seems to be, almost exclusively, Babylonia. They will be discussed in more detail on pp. 82-88 below.</p>
                  <p>The specimen here described, and in striking contrast to Nos. 44–47 below, is of the same flat, spread fabric to which we have become accustomed in studying Nos. 36–38. Its style, too, is identical with the latter coins and its origin may therefore be assumed to have been <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. Accompanying it must go the little bronze coin No. 41 which was actually purchased in the bazaar at Cairo and probably had been found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. It bears the same curious symbol <graphic url="NNM82_079A.jpg"/> and the same Aramaic inscription as does the tetradrachm No. 40. The inscription, fortunately, is this time written in clear, unequivocal characters which read <graphic url="NNM82_079B.jpg"/> (CH-D-Z-M). The <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">zayin</hi> present typical forms; the <hi rend="italic">daleth</hi> has a short downward stroke; while the <hi rend="italic">kaph,</hi> though as usual more or less identical with <hi rend="italic">daleth</hi>, yet is here carefully distinguished from it by a longer downward stroke. The letters, as they stand before us, can hardly represent aught else but the Persian name Mazaces.</p>
                  <p>In the two coins, then, we have every reason to recognize a continuance of the previously described coinage of Sabaces, now struck under Mazaces who, as our classical sources inform us,<ref target="#CH1-n145">
                        <hi rend="sup">145</hi>
                     </ref> was appointed
<pb n="74"/>
by Darius after Issus to replace as satrap of <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> the fallen Sabaces, and, God willing, to hold the land for the Persian king. Mazaces' task was an unenviable one, being well-nigh hopeless from the very outset. Most if not all of the Persian troops in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> had followed Sabaces. They had doubtless perished or become scattered in the rout. Mazaces must have raised some native levies, for Arrian states that he had no Persian troops, while Diodorus, XVII, 48, 3/4, speaks only of the "inhabitants" of Memphis ('εγχωρίοι and <hi rend="italic">oί</hi> έϰ τῆς πόλεως). With this unpromising material, Mazaces not only firmly upheld Persian rule in a land ripe for rebellion so soon as the dire news of Issus had become generally known, but he even successfully coped with a dangerous invasion by some eight thousand Greek mercenaries who, escaped from Issus, were led into <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> by the ambitious <hi rend="italic">condottiere</hi> Amyntas and some kindred souls desirous of securing a place for themselves in these troublous times. Amyntas and his followers were apparently defeated and slain before the walls of Memphis. But <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and nearly his entire army, fresh from the successful sieges of Tyre and Gaza, were now approaching. Against such an array, Mazaces and his feeble forces were powerless. He opened negotiations, gracefully surrendered the cities and treasures under his jurisdiction, and was kindly treated by the conqueror.</p>
                  <p>The features of Mazaces, as they appear on the little bronze coin, are handsome, genial but not
<pb n="75"/>
over masterful. He, like his friend Amminapes,<ref target="#CH1-n146">
                        <hi rend="sup">146</hi>
                     </ref> doubtless joined the group of noble Persians in <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> train, served his new master faithfully, and was later rewarded (as we have reason to believe)<ref target="#CH1-n147">
                        <hi rend="sup">147</hi>
                     </ref> with some official position in <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> empire. The galley on the reverse of this coin is also interesting, for it is obviously copied from well known Sidonian issues and so supports the attribution to <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> of the trihemiobol of Sabaces mentioned above, p. 66.</p>
                  <p>These coins, Nos. 36–41 inclusive, form a coherent whole, each group supporting the other in its assignment to the land of the Nile, while the proposed explanation of their Aramaic inscriptions confirm the traditional names of the last two Persian satraps of <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>.</p>

                  <p>This rare coin, first described by <persName>Dr. Rouvier,148</persName> has been included by Wruck<ref target="#CH1-n149">
                        <hi rend="sup">149</hi>
                     </ref> among his Roman provincial issues of <placeName corresp="#geonames_163843">Syria</placeName>. In questioning<ref target="#CH1-n150">
                        <hi rend="sup">150</hi>
                     </ref> Rouvier's reading of the inscription, Wruck is correct. The coin bears ΤΡΑΙΑΝΟᴠ (not ΤΡΑΙΑΝ) and ΔΑΚΙ (not ΔΑΚ), just as on the similar specimen in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2950159">Berlin</placeName>. He is mistaken, however, in placing the coin among the Syrian issues.</p>
                  <p>Everything about this piece (fabric, lettering, diecutting, form of the date, etc.) are typical of the great mint at <placeName corresp="#geonames_361058">Alexandria</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. They certainly are not Syrian. The simple expedient of visual juxtaposition with an Alexandrian bronze coin of Trajan's twelfth year (Plate IV, C) is sufficient to establish definitely their origin in a common mint. We even become aware of the possibility that one and the same die-cutter may have prepared their obverse dies. Note, for instance, that the curiously curling diadem ends are practically identical on the two coins.</p>
                  <p>This identification of the mint at once explains certain anomalies in No. 42, which embarrassed Wruck,<ref target="#CH1-n151">
                        <hi rend="sup">151</hi>
                     </ref> because he assumed that the coin had
<pb n="77"/>
been struck in <placeName corresp="#geonames_163843">Syria</placeName>. The most characteristically Egyptian "hallmark" of all is the presence of the Egyptian sign "L," denoting <hi rend="italic">year</hi>, and the use of a regnal year to date by. Neither have been found on other Syrian coins of Trajan, but they do constitute the customary practice at <placeName corresp="#geonames_361058">Alexandria</placeName> since the days of the Ptolemies.<ref target="#CH1-n152">
                        <hi rend="sup">152</hi>
                     </ref> The very presence, then, of LIB on No. 42 should clearly indicate to all that the coin could not possibly be a Syrian but must be an Alexandrian issue. Probably, no one would ever have questioned its origin in the mint of <placeName corresp="#geonames_361058">Alexandria</placeName>, were it not for three important and very obvious considerations: 1) The reverse type of the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> bust is seldom found at <placeName corresp="#geonames_361058">Alexandria</placeName> but is characteristically Tyrian, dating from 124 B.C. when a well known autonomous coinage with this type was inaugurated at Tyre which lasted down into Nero's reign. 2) Later, the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> type appeared again under Trajan and Caracalla at Tyre. 3) The quality of the silver and the weight of the coin are far superior to those of the current Alexandrian potin tetradrachms and, in this respect, are identical with the ordinary Syrian tetradrachms.</p>
                  <p>Thus, we are left with the following contradictory facts: The portrait of Trajan, the style of the diecutting, the fabric of the coin and kind of date it bears are typically Egyptian, while the quality of
<pb n="78"/>
the silver, the weight of the coin and the reverse type it bears are typically Syro-Phoenician. The only way left for us to reconcile these contradictory facts is to admit that the coin is indeed of Egyptian origin, but that it was struck with Syrian types and on the Syrian standard.</p>
                  <p>It being established, then, that we have in No. 42 a special issue of Trajan's well known "Tyrian" tetradrachms coined in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>, there remains the question—why? This, unfortunately, proves difficult to answer satisfactorily, although the fact itself is certain. The date borne by the coin shows it to have been struck at some time between the 1st of Thot (August 29/30) 108 and the 1st of Thot 109 A.D.<ref target="#CH1-n153">
                        <hi rend="sup">153</hi>
                     </ref> If it had belonged to a slightly later period, we might have explained its issue in <placeName corresp="#geonames_361058">Alexandria</placeName> as an attempt to supplement the activities of the mints in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q200441">Antioch</placeName> and Tyre preparing for the Parthian campaigns of Trajan. But in 108/9 A.D., more or less profound peace was being enjoyed throughout the Roman empire. The great Dacian wars had been successfully concluded some two years before; the Parthian war was still from four to five years away.</p>
                  <p>From Trajan's fifth Alexandrian year (101/2 A.D.), through his eleventh (107/8 A.D.) the Alexandrian mint had been steadily coining its usual potin tetradrachms.<ref target="#CH1-n154">
                        <hi rend="sup">154</hi>

The few which bear LIB may then be assigned to the very commencement of that year, after which they ceased to appear until some time in the fourteenth year (110/11 A.D.). Perhaps towards the close of the Julian year 108, or in 109 A.D., may have come the issue of No. 42. Wruck, believing it to have been coined in Syria, suggests<ref target="#CH1-n156">
                        <hi rend="sup">156</hi>
                     </ref> that its issue may have been connected with Trajan's decennial celebrations. But that suggestion will not hold for <placeName corresp="#geonames_361058">Alexandria</placeName>, where the issue would have come much too late.<ref target="#CH1-n157">

But the classical passages quoted to support the theory are none too definite, and the coin invoked is not certainly of the twelfth year.<ref target="#CH1-n160">

                     </ref> In any event, what possible connection a coin
<pb n="80"/>
like No. 42 could have with a merely contemplated visit of Trajan to the east, is not very clear. The fact of the Egyptian origin of No. 42 also does away with Wruck's theory<ref target="#CH1-n161">
                        <hi rend="sup">161</hi>
                     </ref> that it might commemorate the erection at Tyre of a statue of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> bearing the emperor's features, at the time a visit by Trajan was expected or when his decennial votives were being celebrated.</p>
                  <p>Strack has argued<ref target="#CH1-n162">
                        <hi rend="sup">162</hi>
                     </ref> for the inauguration by Trajan (to celebrate his Dacian triumphs) of games in honor of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref>, his divine patron. He bases his theory on the inscription<ref target="#CH1-n163">
                        <hi rend="sup">163</hi>
                     </ref> of one T. Flavius Archibios from <placeName corresp="#geonames_361058">Alexandria</placeName>, who therein lists as third among the celebrated games at which he was victor a Ήράxλεια έxινίxια αύτοxράτορος Νέρουα Τραιανοῦ Καίσαρος Σεβαστοῦ Γερμανιxοῦ Δαxιxοῦ. The place at which these games were once held is unfortunately lost, but Strack argues for <placeName corresp="#geonames_3169070">Rome</placeName>. He places the victory of Archibios just before or just after 106 A.D., certainly not later than 110 A.D. If the Ήράxλεια έπινίxια had been established at Alexandria,164 as is always a possibility because of the present damaged state of the inscription, then the exceptional issues represented by No. 42 may have taken place in connection with the previously
<pb n="81"/>
mentioned games. On this theory, a special issue of coins (or even of monetary prizes) may have been brought out with a type and standard most familiar to visitors from <placeName corresp="#geonames_163843">Syria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q41642">Phoenicia</placeName>. This is admittedly a rather hazardous explanation for the existence of coins like No. 42, and at best is based on but flimsy and unsatisfactory evidence.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is possible that for a moment Trajan actually contemplated a reform in the Alexandrian silver coinage. The old, light-weight, heavily-alloyed potin tetradrachm was to be replaced by a heavier and purer coin closely assimilated in type, weight and alloy to the "Tyrian" money coined in Syria. A parchment document from Dura<ref target="#CH1-n165">
                        <hi rend="sup">165</hi>
                     </ref> has recently revealed to us what great popularity this "Tyrian" money enjoyed at this time, even across the border in Parthian lands. Therefore the coining of the old Alexandrian tetradrachm ceased early in the twelfth Alexandrian year, its place being taken by coins such as No. 42. The experiment seems not to have proved a success however, probably for economic reasons not unconnected with the resultant loss to the emperor's private purse, for the land of <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> was not so much a Roman province as a personal possession of the Roman emperors and fully exploited by them.</p>
                  <p>Be that as it may, the new issue must soon have been stopped and the coins withdrawn, seeing that only two specimens have so far come down to us. The coinage of the regulation Alexandrian potin
<pb n="82"/>
tetradrachm was recommenced in the course of year 14, and continued through the remainder of the reign. No. 42, and its companion piece in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2950159">Berlin</placeName>, are thus interesting mementos of what may have been intended as the beginning of a "new deal" for the long exploited and underprivileged Egyptians.</p>

                  <p>In addition to the two groups of imitation Athenian tetradrachms from <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> discussed above on pp. 62–75, there is yet another very large group of similar coins, which also bears an Aramaic inscription but which is never found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. These coins, in contrast to those from <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>, are struck on small, thick, almost globular planchets. Their style is much more barbaric than that of the Egyptian pieces, and the individual specimens almost invariably come from <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q47690">Babylonia</placeName>. Instead of the punchmarks which characterize the Egyptian tetradrachms, these of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q47690">Babylonia</placeName> never have punchmarks but are frequently gashed with a deep chisel cut. They represent the direct continuation of certain imitation Athenian tetradrachms which bear not an Aramaic inscription but the original ΑΘΕ—of which category the following piece is an example.</p>

                  <p>This coin came from a hoard found, during or shortly after the war, in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q47690">Babylonia</placeName>, of which several specimens were acquired by the British Museum.

                  <p>Similar specimens, but showing the inscription in full, are in the British Museum. A very similar piece was published by Imhoof-Blumer<ref target="#CH1-n166">
                        <hi rend="sup">166</hi>
                     </ref> and was again described by Six,<ref target="#CH1-n167">
                        <hi rend="sup">167</hi>
                     </ref> together with another coin, from a cast in the British Museum, which bears alongside the main inscription the two Aramaic letters, <hi rend="italic">ain</hi> and <hi rend="italic">samech</hi> (reversed). On both of these last two specimens the tops of the letters at the end of the inscription are off flan. Thus, it resulted that both scholars erroneously read the inscription as <graphic url="NNM82_090B.jpg"/> (Mazri) or <graphic url="NNM82_090C.jpg"/> (Mazdi), and Six attributed the coins to Mazaeus. <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>, unfortunately, perpetuated this error in his <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n168">
                        <hi rend="sup">168</hi>
                     </ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Actually, as shown by the new specimens in the British Museum, the inscription reads <graphic url="NNM82_090D.jpg"/> (Mazdak), i.e. the same name that occurs on the Egyptian coins (Nos. 40–41), described earlier. This
<pb n="85"/>
fact, indeed, might have been suspected before, for in the field of these tetradrachms from <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q47690">Babylonia</placeName> there appears the same curious symbol, <graphic url="NNM82_091A.jpg"/> which so clearly characterizes the Egyptian issues of Mazaces. To Mazaces, then, must also be assigned these imitation "owls" from Irak. What exactly is the meaning or significance of the symbol is still uncertain, although <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> saw in it the Himyarite <hi rend="italic">caph</hi> and so suggested that the coins were struck in the Yemen. While its interpretation as a Himyarite letter is extremely doubtful, the assignment of the coins themselves to Arabia is demonstrably mistaken.</p>
                  <p>The issues of Mazaces continue with the following:</p>

of "Mazdad." Because of the uncertainty inherent in so many Aramaic letters, both <graphic url="NNM82_093A.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM82_093B.jpg"/> are possible, but on the analogy of the Egyptian coins Nos. 40-41 and legible specimens of Nos. 4447, the present writer believes the name should be read <graphic url="NNM82_093C.jpg"/> (Mazdak), and all these coins assigned to Mazaces.</p>
                  <p>Because of the Babylonian origin of every specimen in the writer's collection, as well as the hoard in the British Museum, it would seem practically certain that these coins had been struck somewhere in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q47690">Babylonia</placeName>. Because a coin was purchased in Baghdad it need not necessarily have been found in Irak. For a long time, coins actually unearthed in western Persia have been transported by merchants across the border in order to enjoy the more active coin market existing in Baghdad.<ref target="#CH1-n171">

Assuming the coins to be really from the Babylonian district, where could they have been coined?

                  <p>The coins of Hermaeus, perhaps the last Greek prince to hold sway over what is now modern Afghanistan, are for the most part fairly common. There is one type, however, which is excessively rare. On the obverse, we find Hermaeus mounted on a prancing charger; on the reverse, the seated figure of Zeus-Mithra with radiate head and wearing a so-called Phrygian cap, typical of all the later representations of the god Mithra. Hitherto, this particular combination of types has been represented only by a worn but unique drachm which General Cunningham secured from the Sonipat

                        <hi rend="sup">174</hi>
                     </ref> and which is now in the British Museum. A companion piece may perhaps be recognized in a square copper coin, also unique, from Cunningham's collection<ref target="#CH1-n175">
                        <hi rend="sup">175</hi>
                     </ref> and now, too, in the British Museum. This piece bears the horseman on the obverse, but the reverse type is off flan.</p>
                  <p>Recently, the writer has been fortunate enough to secure the tetradrachm belonging to this group. Like Cunningham's drachm it bears the monogram <graphic url="NNM82_096.jpg"/> which is one of those most frequently found on the issues of the Greek princes who once ruled Afghanistan. It may be seen on the coins of Heliocles, Strato I, Archebius, Peucolaus, Diomed, Philoxenus, Amyntus, Hermaeus with Calliope, and Hermaeus alone. Being larger and much better preserved than Cunningham's unique drachm, the present piece allows us the better to appreciate its excellent style and the minute details of its types. It was possibly among Hermaeus' earliest issues and was soon replaced by his far commoner coins<ref target="#CH1-n176">

                     </ref> adorned with the royal portrait on the obverse.</p>
                  <p>The rays which surround the god's head on the reverse are particularly clear on this new tetradrachm, as is also the form of the head-dress which he wears. The type is surely intended for a repre-

                     </ref> under the general guise of the Greek Zeus. The curious object held in his right hand has been noticed previously only by <persName>Mr. Whitehead178</persName> but not discussed by him. The right hand is not held outstretched, with extended forefinger and thumb pointing downwards, as suggested by the engraver of Cunningham's plates and apparently accepted as such without question by later writers, but the god's hand is closed and grasps an object shaped somewhat like <graphic url="NNM82_097.jpg"/> Another and even clearer representation may be seen in the coin illustrated here on Plate V, D. Without desiring to be dogmatic, the writer would call attention to a very similar object held in the outstretched hands of certain deities as depicted on some coins of Kanishka and Huvishka. So far as the writer is aware, it is only Cunningham who has ever mentioned it and attempted to give it a name. Whatever the object may be, it is important to note that it is invariably held by a sun- or moon-god, i.e. ΗΛΙΟС (Plate V, E), СΑΛΗΝΗ (Brit. Mus. Cat., Pl. XXVI, 1), MIIPO or MIOPO (Plate V, F) and MAO (Plate V, G).<ref target="#CH1-n179">

                     </ref> Cunningham, whenever he notes the object, calls it a pair of callipers and explains its significance " … to represent the Sun as a 'measurer of time' by <hi rend="italic">years</hi>. The same type occurs with the moon-god <hi rend="italic">Mao</hi>, who was also a 'measurer of time' by <hi rend="italic">months</hi>."<ref target="#CH1-n181">

If the explanation be the true one, then it is not surprising to find the object also in the hand of the deity depicted on the coins of Hermaeus. For the rays about his head are clear, and definitely proclaim him likewise a sun-god.</p>

of one hand. Curiously enough, the reverse type of the tetradrachm differs from that found on the known drachms. But this may be partially accounted for by the fact that, according to its monogram, it was coined in another mint. This type of the fighting <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>, in frontal aspect, occurs also on some very rare coins of Strato I, although on the latter she is standing, not striding to the left as on our coin. Her attitude also reminds one of the fighting Zeus seen on the coins of Archebius. But the monogram on our coin associates it with the issues of Antialcidas, Lysias(?), and Philoxenus, princes ruling in northwest <placeName corresp="#geonames_1269750">India</placeName>, and not with the coins of the Greek princes of Afghanistan.</p>
                  <p>The existence of a tetradrachm in the series of Nicias, suggests that some day may also be found tetradrachms of his immediate predecessors, Lysias and Theophilus, with whose coins his are closely associated in style and monograms.</p>

                  <p>This strange little coin was many years ago selected in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> from among a miscellaneous lot of Parthian, Indo-Parthian, Kushan and later

oriental coins of all sorts and ages. Unfortunately, the inscription is not quite complete, as a sizeable fragment has at some time been broken out of the coin. As it stands, however, the damaged inscription is about all that we have to guide us in attributing the coin to its original issuer.</p>
                  <p>Of the first letter in the first line, only a portion seems to have been left us by the corrosion, presenting a curved stroke with a rather sharp angle. Because the two succeeding letters are vowels, this stroke ought surely to be part of some consonant. This rules out a possible <hi rend="italic">eta</hi>. It could be a lunate <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> were it not for the fact that the only other <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> present in the inscription is definitely square in form. It could be the right-hand stroke of a curved <hi rend="italic">mu</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nu,</hi> but the curve appears to be considerably more acute than these letters present in the second name on our coin. By turning the coin about, backwards and forwards, in various strong lights there does seem (to the writer at least) to remain a slight indication of the lower left <hi rend="italic">hasta</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">chi</hi> as X. This, together with the succeeding five definitely clear letters, gives us ΧΕΙΡΟϒ as the genitival form of some such name as ΧΕΙΡΟΗΣ or ΧΕΙΡΟΣ.</p>
                  <p>The next two letters still preserved to us are an <hi rend="italic">omicron</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">upsilon.</hi> These might, of course, belong to the second name, but it is easier and more reasonable to assume that a <hi rend="italic">tau</hi>, or even <hi rend="italic">upsilon iota</hi>, are off flan and that we have before us what remains of the usual Greek τοῦ or υίοῦ preceding the patr-

onymic. Further probability is lent to this assumption by the slightly enhanced space existing between the final <hi rend="italic">upsilon</hi> and the following letter, thus suggesting a word separation at this particular spot. Because of the available space, the writer believes that it may be only a <hi rend="italic">tau</hi> that is actually missing.</p>
                  <p>The first letter of the father's name presents the form <graphic url="NNM82_102.jpg"/> This could well be an <hi rend="italic">eta</hi>, although that would give a rather weird and unsatisfactory form to the name. In late times, in the Greek orient, the letter <hi rend="italic">mu</hi> often assumes this debased shape.<ref target="#CH1-n183">
                        <hi rend="sup">183</hi>
                     </ref> On the other hand, we apparently possess a strictly orthodox <hi rend="italic">mu</hi> in the slightly damaged letter at the beginning of the next line. Hence, the writer would prefer to recognize here the sound <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> as <persName>Dr. Fleet</persName> has shown<ref target="#CH1-n184">
                        <hi rend="sup">184</hi>
                     </ref> to be the case with a letter of this identical shape in the name Kharahostes (in the Greek inscription) appearing on the more or less contemporary coins of that ruler. To this, there succeed the two clearly written letters <hi rend="italic">alpha</hi> (in cursive form) and <hi rend="italic">rho,</hi> followed by a <hi rend="italic">lacuna</hi> of from two to three characters, itself followed by the obviously genitival ending ΜΟϒ. For the father's name, then, we secure some such form as Har … mos or Har … mes. But if we should read the first letter as a <hi rend="italic">mu,</hi> then the antepenult, being of another form, might be taken as a <hi rend="italic">nu</hi> written backwards.<ref target="#CH1-n185">
                        <hi rend="sup">185</hi>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="97"/>
                  <p>We thus would have some such form as Mar … nos or Mar … nes. The first suggestion appears to the writer to be the more acceptable one.</p>
                  <p>The succeeding square <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi>, the writer takes to be the first letter of the next word, of which we have, besides, only ΑΠΟ. The space at our disposal and the probable presence of some sort of title following the two names, readily allow us to complete this word as σατράπου.</p>
                  <p>Who may Cheires, son of Har … mes, the Satrap, have been? And where and when did he rule? No prince of this name appears to be known to history or to numismatics.</p>
                  <p>There are several factors which lead us to look eastwards for his sphere of existence. In the first place, the <hi rend="italic">milieu</hi> in which the coin turned up suggests Persia, <placeName corresp="#geonames_1149361">Afghanistan</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_1269750">India</placeName>. Certain letters in the inscription are typical of inscriptions found on late Parthian, even more so on Indo-Scythic or Indo-Parthian issues. The lunate <hi rend="italic">epsilon</hi> is as common in the west as it is in the east and so is of little assistance to us here. The <hi rend="italic">rho</hi> tends distinctly to assume the square form on coins of Zeionises, satrap of Taxila. The square <hi rend="italic">omicron</hi> appears as early as the second century B.C. on coins of Nicias and Hippostratos, is common on those of Spalyris, Spalirises, Azes and their successors, but first occurs in Parthia on the coins of Orodes II (57–38 B.C.). The first step towards a cursive <hi rend="italic">alpha</hi> begins to appear under the Greco-Indian princes in the form <graphic url="NNM82_103.jpg"/> This becomes usual in the Indo-Scythic period, when
<pb n="98"/>
also the more rounded form <graphic url="NNM82_104.jpg"/> occurs from time to time. Both forms continue into the Kushan period, but the rounded form now largely predominates. The square <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> occurs as early as some of the bronze coins of Nicias, appears once or twice on those of Azes, is common on the issues of Spalyris, Spalirises, Gondophares, Sanabares, Kharahostes, Phseigacharis, Sapaleizes, Soter Megas, Kujula Kadphises and Kadaphes. But, after that, it again gives way to the lunate form. On Parthian coins, it occurs as early as Orodes II (57–38 B.C.), and afterwards becomes quite common. While the square forms of <hi rend="italic">omicron</hi> and especially <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi>, as well as the cursive <hi rend="italic">alpha</hi>, do appear occasionally on coins to the west of the Tigris-Euphrates valley, they are particularly common on Parthian and Indian coins and support our assignment of No. 58 to the far east of the Greek world.</p>
                  <p>As regards the portrait head, its style is distinctly good, better, in fact, than those of Pacores, Orthagnes and Sanabares, and infinitely better than the crude heads of Gondophares and Abdagases. This may be due to a more skillful die-cutter; it may also be due to his earlier date or to the fact that he may have been more exposed to Greek influence. The embroidered upper edge of the robe is similar to that found on the bronze coins of Sanabares.<ref target="#CH1-n186">
                        <hi rend="sup">186</hi>
                     </ref> The head-dress suggests the usual Parthian one, but only in a general way, as the concave outline at the back and the flaring but somewhat flattened

upper contour give the object on our coin a more individual character. It is not exactly like any bonnet or head-piece known to numismatics. Due to the corroded state of the coin, it is not possible to determine whether the bonnet possesses a long neck-piece, or whether this portion was intended to represent the satrap's hair. It is also to be noted that the usual flowing diadem-ends and large bow, which appear behind the head on Parthian and Kushan coins, seem to be lacking.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, everything about the coin has pointed to the east. One peculiarity, however, does not. The use of parallel lines of inscription to fill the reverse flan is not known to early Indian coins, while on Parthian coins it occurs only once—a small civic issue, probably of Ecbatana. In the west the practice is much more common, appearing on certain issues of Ma'nu of Edessa and prevalent throughout the Greco-Roman world. The preponderance of evidence, however, still seems to point to the east.</p>
                  <p>As for the date, by taking the forms of the letters and the general style and fabric into consideration, the coin may reasonably be assigned to the first century B.C., perhaps to its second half.</p>
                  <p>The curious names and especially the use of the diphthong, ιε, remind one of such Indo-Parthian or Indo-Scythian(?) princes as Sapaleizes, Phseiga-charis and Zeionises.<ref target="#CH1-n187">

               <p>The original coin is a common type of the square bronze issues of the Greco-Indian king, Apollodotus I. In comparatively recent times, to judge by the character of the Arabic inscription and the uncertain design on the reverse, the ancient coin has been re-used as a blank at the mint of some minor Mohammedan rajah or emir. The process of recoining was not very efficiently carried out, and the ancient types and inscriptions are far more legible than those of the Mohammedan prince.</p>

               <p>Of the latter's types, one can still read on the obverse the word <hi rend="italic">falus,</hi> accompanied above and below by indistinct traces of further letters or numerals. On the reverse, double-striking has rendered the modern legend practically illegible except for a possible <graphic url="NNM82_107A.jpg"/> Available publications of Oriental coins, as well as the well-stocked trays of the American Numismatic Society, have been searched without finding anything which exactly corresponds to the over-strike. Perhaps the nearest is represented by some squarish or octagonal coins of one Mahmoud Khan struck at Kalat in Baluchistan. On these, the word <hi rend="italic">falus</hi> is written in a similar fashion. Below it, stands the mint name <graphic url="NNM82_107B.jpg"/> of which, on our coin, the two topmost points of the <hi rend="italic">lam-alif</hi> appear still to be distinguishable. The reverses of the Kalat coins bear the ruler's name, Mahmoud Khan. This may be represented by the <graphic url="NNM82_107C.jpg"/> although the remaining traces of letters do not seem to correspond very closely with such Kalat coins as chance to be available. This, however, may be the result of the very severe disfigurement of the inscription occasioned by the double-striking. The writer is far from being completely satisfied with the Γ roposed identification and would welcome further suggestions.</p>
