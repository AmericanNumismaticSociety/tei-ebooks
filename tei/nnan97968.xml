            </head>

            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman</hi> gold medallions have come down to us from antiquity in much smaller number than the silver and bronze medallions.
               Nevertheless, it is quite probable that a considerable number were coined, but on account of the intrinsic value of the metal relatively few are
               now extant. It may be taken as a general principle that all Roman medallions are rare and, as <persName>Gnecchi</persName> says, they form
               the most élite and aristocratic portion of a collector's cabinet. The following five pieces which are here presented are no exception to the rule
               above stated. The first four belong to the period of <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_i">Constantine the Great</persName>, <pb n="2"/> 306–337 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>; while the fifth is an issue of <persName corresp="#nomisma_valentinian_i">Valentinian
                  I</persName>, 364–375 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first medallion of the group, with a diademed head of Constantine the Great, is a unique piece which was not known to <persName>Cohen</persName> and is not illustrated in <persName>Gnecchi</persName>'s famous work on the Roman medallions. It belongs to the Pierpont
               Morgan Collection, and was formerly in the collection of Consul Weber of <placeName>Hamburg</placeName>, into whose collection it came from
               that of Count Ponton d'Amécourt. The second medallion, bearing the portrait of Constantine II, son of Constantine the Great, is also in the
               Pierpont Morgan Collection, and it likewise was formerly in the Weber and Ponton d'Amécourt Collections. It is not unique, for the <placeName>Brussels</placeName> Collection possesses a second example from different obverse and reverse dies. The third piece, with a laureate
               head of Constantine the Great, belongs to the Collection of <persName>Dr. de Yoanna</persName> of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. It is known to us in some six or seven examples and is the commonest of the group
               here presented. The fourth piece, with a radiate head, also <pb n="3"/> of Constantine the Great, is now in the possession of <persName>Sir Arthur Evans</persName> who obtained it from the Consul Weber Collection. It is known to us in only three examples — one in the Evans
               Collection, one in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, and one in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_berlin">Berlin</placeName>. The fifth medallion discussed here is a unique piece which is in the Brussels Museum, and was formerly in the collection of
                  <persName>Count du Chastel</persName>. A letter from the. <persName>Count du Chastel</persName>, dated June 2, 1896, referring to
               the famous Montagu Collection sold in 1896 gives us the very interesting information that this gold medallion had formerly belonged to the
               grandfather of the present <persName>Count du Chastel</persName>. The writer states that the medallion was stolen from his grandfather in
               his <placeName>chéteau</placeName> at the time of the occupation of <placeName>Belgium</placeName> by foreign troops in 1794. This unique
               medallion had disappeared from view, which was a great loss especially as it had never been published. Later on, it appeared in the English
               catalogue of the Montagu Collection, lot No. 914, and was acquired by the present <persName>Count du Chastel</persName>, with whose <pb n="4"/> collection it passed into the National Collection of <placeName>Brussels</placeName>.</p>
            <p>There is considerable interest from the historical viewpoint attaching to the four medallions of the period of Constantine the Great. The
               medallion of Valentinian offers perhaps less historical interest, but the fact that it is a unique example entitles it to our consideration.
               Furthermore, while <persName>Gnecchi</persName> figures this medallion on one of his plates, the reproduction is extremely poor and does no
               justice to the original.</p>
            <p>Roman medallions have not formed the subject of such frequent discussion as they deserve. In the bibliography appended to this article, the chief
               sources in which the Roman medallions are discussed and illustrated have been listed. Those articles or books which deal with the subject most
               comprehensively are distinguished by an asterisk. Two works on this list are designated with a double asterisk. These are, namely, the great work
               in three volumes by <persName corresp="#viaf_76446816">Francesco Gnecchi</persName>, <hi rend="italic">I Medaglioni Romani</hi>, published
               in 1912, and the article <pb n="5"/> by <persName corresp="#viaf_164645882">Friedrich Kenner</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Der Rémische
                  Medaillon, Num. Zeit.,</hi> 1887, pp. 1–173.</p>
            <p>These works are the most important for complete presentation of the subject, <persName>Gnecchi's</persName> book giving us illustrations and
               a catalogue of nearly all of the known types, and <persName>Kenner's</persName> article furnishing the most complete analysis of the nature
               of the medallion. Briefer discussions on the nature of the medallion are found in the various articles by <persName>Gracchi</persName> in
               the <hi rend="italic">Riv. Ital.</hi> An article dealing especially with the medallions of Constantine the Great and his family, but containing
               also some new material relative to the purpose of the medallion, is the one by <persName>O. Seeck</persName> in the <hi rend="italic">Zeit.
                  f. Num.,</hi> 1898, pp. 17–65. For general orientation, one should consult <persName>M. Babelon's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Traité des Monnaies Grecques et Romaines,</hi> Vol. I<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, pp. 652–670.</p>
            <p>Certain special articles, as is so often the case, throw a great deal of light on some phases of the problem presented by the medallions, and
               among these one might mention the articles of <persName>Sir John Evans</persName> and <persName>Sir Arthur Evans</persName> in the Nu-
                  <pb n="6"/> mismatic Chronicle. As one would naturally turn to the subject of Greek medallions in any discussion of the nature and origin of
               the Roman medallion, some additional references on this subject are given at the end of the bibliography.</p>

               <p>These two medallions of Constantine the Great and his son, Constantine Junior, may best be discussed together since the occasion on which the
                  second piece was issued will probably throw light upon the occasion for the issue of the larger medallion.</p>
               <p>We may begin, therefore, with a description of the medallion of Constantine Junior. It is a triple solidus or ternio of <pb n="9"/> the mint
                  of <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> (Saloniki) in <placeName>Thrace</placeName>, and is a piece which can be definitely dated. The
                  reverse inscription reads: <hi rend="italic">Votis decenn(alibus) d{omini)n{ostri) Constantini Caes(aris)</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">(solutis</hi>), "The Decennial vows of our Lord, Constantine <persName>Caesar</persName> (having been paid)," and the
                  reverse type consists of two small genii bearing a festoon. These small winged figures may represent the two periods of five years each, which
                  make up the ten-year period at the end of which the Vota Decennalia were celebrated. A similar reverse with the inscription, <hi rend="italic">Gaudium Augusti nostri,</hi> "The happiness of our Augustus," occurs on a triple solidus or ternio (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 159)
                  struck by Constantine the Great at the mint of Constantinople, a medallion which is dated by <persName>Maurice</persName> in the same
                  period as the medallion under discussion (<hi rend="italic">Num</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Cons tan.,</hi> Vol. II, p. 495, No. vii). The
                  decennial festival at which vows for the success of the Emperor in the future were offered, and at which vows undertaken in the past were
                  celebrated, was made the occasion of a special <pb n="10"/> commemorative issue in the coinage. These thanksgiving or festival anniversaries
                  in the earlier period<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> — <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> up to the reign of Commodus — were marked by the type, a
                  veiled figure of the Emperor at an altar, and accompanied by the inscription, <hi rend="italic">Vota suscepta decennalia</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi>, etc. Later, the usual types were an inscription within a wreath, or an inscription on a shield placed on
                  a cippus or held by a Victory, or supported by two Victories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Vota medallion, ternio, of Constantine II</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the earlier Empire, mention of the Vota celebrations supplies a valuable indication of the date of issue, but during the later Empire
                  it became customary to anticipate the normal arrival of such festivals. The periods were sometimes celebrated a year in advance and sometimes
                  after a definite cycle had elapsed and been commemorated on the coinage, the ensuing period was at once placed upon the coinage. Thus, when
                  Constantine had completed his Vicennial anniversary, he struck coins with the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">vot xxx</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> But each actual <pb n="11"/> celebration of the anniversary of the reign was commemorated by games, by a special
                  issue of coins, and by the issue of medallions such as the one here represented, probably for distribution.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Flavius Claudius</persName> Junius Constantinus, as Constantine II or Junior was officially called, was born at Arles in the
                  year 316 and was elevated to the rank of <persName>Caesar</persName> in 317. He would, therefore, have been a youth of barely ten years
                  of age when the present medallion was struck. The features of Constantine Junior are here depicted as youthful in accordance with his age.
                  Constantine II shared the rank of <persName>Caesar</persName> with <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName>, his
                  half-brother, who was sixteen years his senior, and with <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName> the younger, son of
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName> who was at first Constantine the Great's coruler in the Empire. After the
                  death of Constantine the Great in 337, Constantine II was proclaimed <persName>Augustus</persName>, but perished three years later in 340
                  at the age of 24 in the contest with his younger brother Constans I over his share in their father's Empire. Hence, the dates here <pb n="12"/> given, 317–337, cover the period during which Constantine was <persName>Caesar</persName> or prince in the royal household.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Another gold piece commemorating the Decennial anniversary of Constantine Junior as <persName>Caesar</persName>, is the double solidus or
                  binio (<ref target="#fig-4">Fig. 1</ref>) with the diademed head of Constantine Junior raised in the same attitude as that seen on our
                  medallion of Constantine the Great. The inscription around the head reads: <hi rend="smallcaps">constantinvs nob. c</hi>. — <hi rend="italic">Constantinus nob</hi>(<hi rend="italic">ilis</hi>) <hi rend="italic">C</hi>(<hi rend="italic">aesar</hi>). The reverse bears simply the
                  inscription in four lines as follows : <hi rend="smallcaps">votis</hi>. X. <hi rend="smallcaps">caes.n. s.m. ts</hi>. — <hi rend="italic">Votis decennalibus Caes</hi>(<hi rend="italic">aris</hi>) <hi rend="italic">n</hi>(<hi rend="italic">ostri</hi>) (<hi rend="italic">solutis</hi>), <hi rend="italic">s</hi>(<hi rend="italic">acra</hi>) <hi rend="italic">m</hi>(<hi rend="italic">oneta</hi>)
                  T(he)s(salonicae), "The Decennial vows of our <persName>Caesar</persName> (having been paid), Sacred <pb n="13"/> mint of <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName>." This binio is, also, of the mint of <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> and is of the highest
                  interest since it is a coin which can be approximately dated showing the interesting type of the uplifted head seen on the larger medallion,
                  Pl. I, which is later in date. Its weight, 8.75 grams, shows that it is the double of a solidus of about 4.45 grams. It is published by <persName>J. Maurice</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Num</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Constan.,</hi> Vol. II, Pl. xiv, 13) and is now in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_berlin">Berlin</placeName>. The upward pose of the head with the eyes uplifted is a type created by Constantine
                  the Great and dates back to the Council of <placeName>Nicaea</placeName>, which was in session from June 19 to August 25, 325. <persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName> in his Life of Constantine the Great (<hi rend="italic">Vita Const.,</hi> Book

                  <placeName>Africa</placeName>), and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName> were here assembled." <persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName>, himself, was probably the chief ranking bishop of the Council which was attended in person by
                  the Emperor. Constantine's entry into the assembly of bishops is vividly de- <pb n="14"/> scribed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName>, his admirer and panegyrist. The majestic yet modest bearing and gorgeous jewels and purple
                  cloak, form an interesting pen picture to supplement the accounts of his personal appearance which have come down to us from various

               <p>In Book IV, Ch. 15, of the Life, we read the following explanations of the coin types with uplifted head, "How deeply his soul was impressed
                  by the power of Divine Faith may be understood from the circumstance that he directed that his portrait should be so represented on the gold
                  coins as to appear to be looking upwards in an attitude of prayer intent upon God."</p>

               <p>
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName> adds that this money became current throughout the Roman world, and that
                  Constantine's full length portrait was placed over the entrance gates of palaces in some cities, the eyes uplifted to Heaven, and the hands
                  outspread as if in prayer.</p>
               <p>The old view was that Constantine the Great was imitating <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName> in
                  this pose of the head. This attitude of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName> is not found upon coins
                  issued by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> since, of course, we have no real portrait of the Macedonian
                  hero on his own coins, although his successor, Lysimachus, struck coins with <persName>Alexander's</persName> portrait under the guise of
                  an idealized head of Zeus Ammon. But the biographers of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great and
                  certain marble busts which have come down to us indicate that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> either
                  affected an individual pose of the head, or carried his head rather differently from the ordinary mortal because of some physical peculiarity.
                  Furthermore, Plutarch who had seen portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> by Lysippus, the great
                  sculptor of the period, states <pb n="16"/> in his Life of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, Ch. IV, that
                  his head was inclined somewhat to the left side and looked upwards. The famous Tarsus medallion with the bare head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and later coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>
                  during the Roman period show the head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> with the chin raised and the
                  eyes somewhat uplifted, but there can be no question, in view of the explicit statement of <persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName>, that the correct explanation of this characteristic on certain Constantinian medallions is that this posture indicates
                  the attitude of prayer. An <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> cult was indeed inaugurated after the death of
                  the hero, and <persName>Alexander's</persName> portrait was worn as an amulet until late in the Fourth Century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Nevertheless, <persName>Eusebius'</persName> explanation is far more plausible when we consider that the same attitude of
                  the head is found on commemorative coins of the youthful <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> and of the young
                  Constantine, who would be far more fittingly represented in a religious attitude, lifting their countenances in gratitude to God for the
                  successful conclusion of the ten-year period as <persName>Caesars.</persName>

               <p>To compare either the young Caesars or Constantine the Great with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> is
                  quite inappropriate, and if we could imagine that Constantine himself had a <hi rend="italic">flair</hi> for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, it is absurd to suppose that the imitation of this peculiar pose of the head would have
                  been countenanced by Constantine also on the coins of the <persName>Caesar</persName>s. Another objection is that the uplifted pose
                  begins after the Council of <placeName>Nicaea</placeName> in 325 (see the binio, Fig. 1, and the solidus of the <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> mint here shown, <ref target="#fig-5">Fig. 2</ref>), and is found on more conspicuous medallions of ten years later
                  (see the large medallion on Pl. I, and the solidus of the mint of <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName> here shown, <ref target="#fig-6">Fig.
                     3</ref>), a long time after the conversion of Constantine to Christianity, when the imitation of a <pb n="18"/> pagan hero would hardly
                  have been very fitting.</p>

               <p>We learn from the life of Constantine the Great, that his Vicennial anniversary was celebrated first at <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName>,
                  on March 1, 325 (<persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Vita Constantini</hi>, Book I, 1) and then,
                  according to the usual custom, was renewed in July in the year 326 at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, Constantine
                  being present at both celebrations. The year 325, however, was one year in advance of the actual accomplishment of his Vicennalia, since the
                  date from which these periodical celebrations were reckoned was the elevation to the rank of <persName>Caesar</persName>. Thus, for
                  Constantine the Great, the Vota would be reckoned from the year 306, for <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> and
                  Constantine II, from the year 317. The Decennial Vota of Constantine <pb n="19"/> Junior (and <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName>) would, therefore, fall normally in the year 327, but fetes took place in anticipation of the celebration, and Constantine
                  ordered the Decennalia of the <persName>Caesar</persName>s celebrated throughout the Empire one year in advance of their accomplishment.
                  Thus, the renewed celebration of his own Vicennalia in 326 fell in the same year as the anticipated Decennalia of the <persName>Caesar</persName>s. In this year, 326, therefore, after the meeting of the Nicaean Council in 325, the type of the uplifted head in the
                  attitude of prayer appears on the medallions of Constantine II, as well as on those of Constantine the Great (see below, Fig. 6).</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Nicaean type on coins of Crispus</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same type of head occurs on the regular currency of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> (always head to the right
                  and wearing a diadem), no inscription on the obverse, and the figure of Victory bearing a wreath in the right hand and palm branch in the left
                     (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 59, solidus). The inscription on the reverse reads <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Crispus Caesar</persName>
                  </hi>. This coin, on account of the medallic-like character of its obverse, and the inscription being <pb n="20"/> transferred from its usual
                  position on the obverse to the reverse, would appear to have been issued to commemorate some particular event, and the similarity of its
                  obverse type to the obverse type of Constantine Junior's Decennial medallion (Fig. 1) suggests that the occasion for its issue was likewise
                  the Decennial anniversary of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName>, namely, the year 326 in which, as we have seen, the
                  Imperial anniversaries of the young <persName>Caesars</persName> were celebrated one year in advance.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> was executed some time in 326, after having been imprisoned in the fortress of
                  Pola in <placeName>Istria</placeName>, as the result of false accusations brought against him by his stepmother, <persName corresp="#nomisma_fausta">Fausta</persName>. His tragic history, which is well known, recalls the story of the Euripidean tragedy, Hippolytus,
                  preserved for us, also, in Racine's Phédre.</p>
               <p>There has been considerable uncertainty in regard to the precise month when Constantine ordered the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName>. The editors of the writings of <persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName>,
                  the Church History, Life of Constantine <pb n="21"/> the Great, and Oration in praise of Constantine (<hi rend="italic">Library of Nicene and
                     Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church</hi>, <persName>P. Scheff</persName> and <persName>H. Wace</persName>, Vol. I, <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi>, p. 419) believe that <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> was still alive on March
                  1, 326, when the Decennalia were celebrated. They refer to <persName corresp="#viaf_49974517">Eckhel</persName>, Vol. 8, pp. 101–102,
                  where a coin of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 3) with the reverse inscription
                     <hi rend="italic">Beata Tranquillitas</hi>, and with <hi rend="italic">Votis xx</hi> written on an altar is discussed. Now <persName corresp="#viaf_49974517">Eckhel</persName> explains that the Vota xx, if referring to the Vicennial anniversary of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName>, could of course only be placed on the coins after his. Vota x, Decennial
                  anniversary in 326 had been accomplished, but that the mention of his second Consulship which occurs in the obverse inscription reading <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> N. C. Cos. II, places the coin definitely in the year 321 which is, also, the dating
                  given by <persName>Maurice</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Num</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Constan.</hi> II, p. 113). The Vota xx of this piece
                  must hence refer to the Vicennalia of the Augusti, Constantine the Great and <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName>,
                  as <hi rend="italic">suscepta</hi>, 'undertaken,' after the Vota x had been <hi rend="italic">soluta,</hi> 'paid,' in the <pb n="22"/> year
                  316. The Votis xx of this reverse occupies a subordinate place in the type and merely refers to the decade generally, the obverse inscription
                  obviating any ambiguity as to the date. This coin then does not establish the survival of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> after the anniversaries of March, 326, the Decennalia of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> and
                  Constantine Junior.</p>

As he arrived there on
                  July 21 and did not leave until September, <persName>Maurice</persName> concludes that the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> took place in July or August, 326. This view is opposed to that of <persName>O.
                     Seeck</persName> who points out that the absence of any Vota x medallions of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName>
                  corresponding to the five medallions<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> of Constantine II tends to prove that <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> was executed before March 1. But these Vota x medallions of the <persName>Caesar</persName>s
                  were probably not struck until July, 326, during the visit of Constantine to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and the
                  celebration of his own Vicennalia, rather than on March 1 of this year (<persName>Maurice</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Num.

               <p>It would seem more probable, in any event, to suppose that the gold pieces of the type described (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 59) were
                  subsequent to the issue of Constantine the Great with the same type of head (see below Fig. 6). These latter coins, as we shall see, are
                  probably to be regarded as struck for the commemoration of the celebration of 326.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> The type was perpetuated on
                  the coins of the succeeding <persName>Caesars</persName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_dalmatius">Dalmatius</persName>, in silver
                     (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 3); Constantius II, in gold (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 75), and Constans I, in silver (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 2, mint of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, and <ref target="#fig-7">Fig. 4</ref>, mint of <placeName>Cyzicus</placeName>). <persName>Maurice</persName> (Vol. II, p. 408, Note 1) states that this type of coin with the tilted
                  head occurs on the coins of all the emperors after Constantine <pb n="24"/> the Great at all important imperial anniversaries down to the time
                  of <persName>Julian</persName> the Apostate. He says that this attitude is found on coins of <persName>Julian</persName> as <persName>Caesar</persName> but that when he was made <persName>Augustus</persName> and declared himself the adversary of Christianity,
                  the type disappears. If this is true, it would seem to confirm what has preceded in establishing the Christian meaning of the type.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Tricennial medallion of Constantine</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The large medallion of Constantine the Great (Pl. I) can be very definitely dated from another gold issue having a similar reverse type from
                  the mint of <placeName>Siscia</placeName> (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 237). The inscription of the smaller piece which is equal to
                  11/2 solidi, reads <hi rend="italic">Gloria Constantini Aug.,</hi> and Constantine is dragging by the hair another barbarian captive with his
                  right hand, instead of carrying the spear, as on the larger medallion. In other respects, however, the reverse types are similar, the mint is
                  identical, and, what is most important, the obverse type is of the same medallic character, that is, uplifted and diademed head of the Emperor
                  to the <pb n="25"/> right, and lacks the inscription. This piece is classified by <persName>Maurice</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Num</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Const.</hi> II., p. 366, Pl. x, 24) in the 13th issue of the coinage of this mint, struck between September
                  18, 335, and May 22, 337, the date of the death of Constantine the Great. Now the Tricennial anniversary of Constantine the Great was
                  celebrated twice, as usual, on July 25 in the years 335 and 336. The second celebration would also have been the 20th anniversary of
                  Constantine Junior, that is to say, the anticipatory celebration of 336. It was, therefore, an extraordinary occasion, and, as such, called
                  for the issue of very special coins to commemorate the great event. The large medallion and also the small one from the mint of <placeName>Siscia</placeName> are probably to be assigned to 336, the year of the second celebration, as this appears to be the more important
                  event, since <persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName> refers to it in his <hi rend="italic">Vita Constantini</hi> iv,
                  49.</p>
               <p>The obverse type and reverse legend of our medallion refer only to Constantine the Elder. Gold medallions of smaller denomination are known
                  referring to the <pb n="26"/> Tricennial anniversary of Constantine the Great, namely, the medallion (<ref target="#fig-8">Fig. 5</ref>)
                  bearing the diademed head to the right with the obverse inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">constan- tinvs max. avg</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Constantinus Max</hi>(<hi rend="italic">imus</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Aug</hi>(<hi rend="italic">ustus</hi>), and the reverse type simply
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">votis xxx</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Votis tricennalibus</hi>(<hi rend="italic">solutis</hi>), within a wreath. The

                  the mint of <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> (<persName>Maurice</persName>, Vol. II, p. 478, No. VIII). This example from the
                  collection of <persName>Mr. E. T. Newell</persName> (formerly Weber Collection, Cat. Pl. xlv, 2599) is 23 mm. in diameter but weighs only
                  5.32 grams. It is not, therefore, a double solidus as its diameter suggests, but an aureus, struck on the basis <pb n="27"/> of sixty coins to
                  the gold pound. This was the usual current gold piece of the time of Diocletian which was supplanted in 309 by the solidus, first struck in
                  this year by Constantine the Great, on the basis of seventy-two coins to the pound of gold. The aureus still continued to be issued
                  occasionally as a special commemorative piece or medallion. The features of the idealized head on this medallion are very youthful, and it has
                  been suggested that the head may be that of Constantine Junior. One may object that the inscription <hi rend="italic">'Constantinus Maximus
                     Augustus'</hi> could not refer to the younger Constantine, but Constantine II was proclaimed Maximus in the month of September, 337, and
                  although the medallion commemorates the Tricennalia of Constantine the Great, celebrated in 335 and 336, still it is possible that
                  commemorative medallions of this type were issued throughout the next year, and that the head and the inscription on the particular piece
                  before us refers to Constantine Junior. The idealization of the heads, however, on these medallic <pb n="28"/> pieces renders it an impossible
                  matter to decide with certainty from the portrait alone, but in view of the inscriptions, the head is probably an idealized head of
                  Constantine the Great with juvenile aspect.</p>

                  also from <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName>. The examples with the spelling '<hi rend="italic">equis</hi>' are the more numerous. The
                  obverse shows a fine portrait of Constantine the Great, more realistic than that on the larger medallions with uplifted head. The reverse type
                  is of special interest as it represents Constantine as a member, or rather leader, of the Roman Equestrian Order.</p>

               <p>This medallion may be more easily understood if we consider in connection with it the large gold medallions struck by Constantine, with the
                  reverse type representing him standing, in senatorial dress, carrying in his right hand the globe, and in his left hand an inverted sceptre
                  with the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">senatvs</hi> — <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi>, "The Senate"; in the exergue, <hi rend="smallcaps">s.

This reverse occurs with gold medallions of two <pb n="32"/> denominations; first, the medallion equivalent to
                  4 1/2 solidi here shown from the <placeName>Berlin Museum</placeName>, 35 mm. in diameter, weighing 19.85 grs. from the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, having as an obverse type the uplifted, diademed head of the Emperor; second, a medallion
                  whose obverse shows the bust of Constantine the Great in rich senatorial costume, bearing the sceptre surmounted by an eagle in his right hand
                  and the globe in his left, in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName>, 33 mm. in diameter and weighing 13.23
                  gr., equivalent therefore to 3 solidi and hence, a ternio, from the mint of <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> (<persName>Cohen</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Méd. Imp.</hi> 502; <persName>Maurice</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Num. Const.,</hi> Vol. II., Pl.
                  xiv, 14). These two medallions with the <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> reverse, and the smaller pieces with the <hi rend="italic">Equis
                     Romanus</hi> reverse form a series of graduated weights of 4 1/2, 3, and 1 1/2 solidi, the unit being the piece of solidi which we are
                  discussing and the multiples increasing each by 1 1/2 solidi. These coins are quite obviously connected by their weights and their types. Von
                  Sallet supposed that they were memorial coins <pb n="33"/> struck to commemorate the founding of Constantinople, and that they refer to the
                  institution of the two Roman social orders in the new metropolis. But, it has been objected, we know already of a series of foundation
                  medallions, all of which were struck in Constantinople itself, whereas none of the examples with the senatorial and equestrian types is known
                  to have been issued in Constantinople. Also, we have no evidence of the existence of the Equestrian Order in Constantinople. <persName>O. Seeck</persName> believes that the reverses refer to those classes to which the medallions were designed to be distributed. The
                  knights would receive the 1 1/2 gold medallion as a souvenir; the senators, and those of their rank, such as the consuls, the 3 and 4 1/2
                  pieces. He refers to the letters of Symmachus, to the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus, to support his theory that the Emperor gave gifts to
                  important personages on the occasion of certain fetes. His theory in regard to the distribution of the medallions will be discussed when we
                  have finished describing all the medallions.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The date at which our medallion No. 3 was issued is not to be absolutely determined by any indication on the group of three coins which have
                  just been described, but Seeck compares this group with another series of three gold medallions. Two of this second group are here
                  represented, namely, our No. 2, the triple solidus of Constantine Junior, Pl. II, and the double solidus of this same prince (Fig. 1). A third
                  coin belonging here is the binio in the British Museum bearing the bust of Constantine Junior and referring, like the two others, to his
                  Decennial anniversary. The coins of this second group were issued at the mints of <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> and <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName>, and were undoubtedly intended as complimentary gifts on the occasion of the Imperial anniversary as we have
                  seen. They all relate to Constantine Junior and range in weight from 3 to 2 solidi, the unit (here <hi rend="italic">assumed</hi>), being the
                  solidus. Seeck points out the resemblance in various points between the two series, and also the resemblance in the profiles on the medallions
                     <pb n="35"/> struck at <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName>, namely, the triple solidus of Constantine the Great, which is the second
                  piece of the senatorial-equestrian group, and the double solidus of Constantine Junior, which is the second piece of the second group (Fig. 1)
                  and concludes that all these pieces were struck probably about the time of the Decennial celebration of Constantine Junior.</p>
               <p>The mints represented on the medallions of these two groups are <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName>, and <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName>. If these pieces belong together in point of time, it may be inferred that
                  they belong to the period after <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName> had been joined to the Empire of Constantine by the defeat of <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName> in 324, and before the foundation of Constantinople in 330, since this mint is
                  unrepresented. The latter is a negative course of argument, but the mints that do occur fit in very well with the theory constructed by Seeck.
                  Constantine, as we know, journeyed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> in 326 and there repeated the celebration of the
                  Vicennalia which he had already held in <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName> the year before, but this time in the centre <pb n="36"/> of the
                  Empire. Now <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> was naturally the place where senators and knights lived in the greatest
                  number — one of the <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> medallions (Fig. 6) was struck there — and if the medallions were designed for distribution
                  in the capital, they may have been struck in <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName> and <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> and brought to
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> by the Emperor. The theory is plausible and forms an interesting explanation of the
                  senatorial and equestrian types. Our <hi rend="italic">Equis Romanus</hi> medallion struck in <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName>, in <placeName>Bithynia</placeName>, may therefore have been distributed by Constantine in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.
                  Yet there were senators and knights in the provinces, and the issues of the provincial mints may just as well have been struck for local
                  distribution. Summing up all the bits of evidence available, the year 326 seems a most likely date for the striking of the
                  senatorial-equestrian medallions of Constantine the Great.</p>

                  city of <placeName>Gaul</placeName>. During the years 327–329, Constantine was occupied in reorganizing the frontiers of the Empire along
                  the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</placeName>. He
                  stayed chiefly in the provinces bordering on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</placeName>, but he went to Tréves at the
                  end of 328 and the beginning of 329, and indications drawn from the Theodosian Code allow us to infer a stay of some length at Tréves during
                  which the striking of this medallion may have been ordered.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The formula <hi rend="smallcaps">augg.</hi> in the plural is remarkable since this medallion, according to <persName>Maurice</persName>,
                  belongs to the issue here described, as is evidenced by the letters <hi rend="smallcaps">p. tre.</hi> in the exergue, whereas for several
                  years, two years, anyway, there had been only one <persName>Augustus</persName>, namely Constantine, in the Empire. <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName>, the other <persName>Augustus</persName>, had been executed in 324, hence, <persName>Maurice</persName> concludes, the formula <hi rend="smallcaps">augg. <persName>gloria</persName>,</hi>

                  <hi rend="bold">The date</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Constantine resided at Tréves for several months during the years 306, 307, 310–316, 328–329, and 331. Were it not for <persName>Maurice's</persName> dating based upon his study of the whole Constantinian coinage at all the mints of the Empire, one might have selected
                  the year 310 when Constantine was at Tréves and celebrated his Quinquennial anniversary (anticipated). In this year was delivered the oration
                  of Eumenius, the official panegyrist, "in an important city on a large river which empties into the <placeName corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</placeName> above Cologne," that is to say, Tréves. From this oration we learn that Constantine had restored
                  the city walls throughout. The exergual formula, however, <hi rend="smallcaps">p. tre.</hi> — <hi rend="italic">Prima Trevirorum</hi>, shows
                  that this year is impossible because Tréves had two ateliers of the mint designated <hi rend="italic">Prima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Secunda</hi> only after the year 313. The period 313–316, when there were two Augusti, would also seem more suitable when we consider the
                  reverse inscription, <hi rend="italic">Augg. gloria.</hi> But this <pb n="41"/> again does not square with <persName>Maurice's</persName>
                  assignment to the period, 326–330, of the particular exergual formula used, <hi rend="smallcaps">p. tre.</hi> Therefore, the contradiction in
                  the reverse inscription is explained (<persName>Maurice</persName>, Vol. 2, p. 412) as due to a certain notion of the plurality of the
                  Augusti not corresponding to reality, and to a certain administrative routine.</p>
               <p>In spite of the weight of evidence, one is inclined nevertheless stubbornly to doubt the assignment of this medallion to the eighth issue of
                  the mint of Tréves, comprised within the limits, Sept. 326, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., after the deaths of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_fausta">Fausta</persName>, and May 11,330, the date of the
                  inauguration of Constantinople. If it were only a question of minor issues, such as bronze or silver, one might accept <persName>Maurice's</persName> thesis. But this gold medallion represents a special issue for which a special die had to be engraved, and, as such, its
                  legends ought to correspond to historical fact. Now during 326–330 Constantine was the <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> Augustus, but the
                  inscription <hi rend="italic">Gloria Augg.</hi> indicates <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Augusti, and <pb n="42"/> it seems an impossibility that
                  such a formula would have been used after the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName> in 324, on a conspicuous
                  commemorative medallion struck by Constantine in the most important city in his realm. Furthermore, although <persName>Maurice</persName>, in defence of his thesis that the formulas <hi rend="italic">Providentiae Augg.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gloria Augg.</hi>
                  on coins which he assigns to this period were preserved partly by custom and partly from a religious sense attaching to the idea of the plural
                  personality of the Augustus, he is forced to admit that the mint of Sirmium which was under Constantine's direct surveillance, and a place
                  where he often resided, never employed the plural form <hi rend="italic">Augg.</hi> after the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName>. The period after 313 and before 324 seems in every way the more probable date for the issue of
                  this Tréves piece.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The radiate head</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The obverse type shows Constantine with the radiate head. This type which embodies a pagan symbolism and which goes back to the earliest days
                  of the Empire, is but rarely found on Constantine's coins.</p>
               <pb n="43"/>
               <p>The symbolism of the radiate head first occurs on the coins of the Seleucid kings of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>.
                  The kings of this dynasty and the Ptolemaic rulers of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> imitated their predecessor,
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexanderthe Great</persName> , to whose kingdom they succeeded, not only in placing their
                  portraits upon the coins but, also, in assuming symbols of divinity. The first king of the Seleucid line who emphasized openly his claim to
                  divinity is Antiochus IV Epiphanes, and accordingly on his coins, chiefly the bronze ones, he is represented with a crown of spikes similar to
                  that worn by the Sun-god Helios or Apollo.</p>
               <p>Thus, the king was assimilated to the Sun-god, and the sun's rays represent a deification. This symbol of deification was transmitted from the
                  Seleucid and Ptolemaic monarchies to the Roman <persName>Caesar</persName>s, but the radiate head on Roman coins is at first found only
                  on the heads of the deified Emperor after his death. For example, the deified <persName>Augustus</persName> occurs with the radiate head
                  on the coinage of his successors, Tiberius and Caligula. So, <pb n="44"/> also, the head of the Emperor Claudius who was the third Roman
                  (after <persName>Julius Caesar</persName> and <persName>Augustus</persName>) to be declared a <hi rend="italic">divus</hi> by the
                  Senate appears with the radiate head after his death. Subsequently, however, under Nero the Emperor is represented as radiate in his own
                  lifetime. This is in accord with what we know of Nero's attitude on the subject, for he is said to have demanded divine honors and a temple
                  for his worship. (Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">AnnaleSy</hi> xv, 74.) Furthermore, there is an aureus (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 44)
                  bearing the inscription <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_germanicus">Augustus Germanicus</persName>
                  </hi> which, on the reverse represents Nero standing and wearing a radiate crown. This coin which is to be explained in connection with the
                  aureus of the <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Augustus Augusta</persName>
                  </hi> type representing Nero and Messalina in a sort of disguised deification, shows again Nero's desire to be registered as a god during his
                  lifetime. After Nero, the radiate head becomes a commonplace, and is used in the coinage in a technical way to distinguish certain
                  denominations in bronze. Nero himself, be it noted, never went so <pb n="45"/> far as to introduce the 'crown of divinity' in his gold or
                  silver, but introduced it modestly in the bronze. That it had a real meaning, however, is sufficiently proved by the fact that Nero employed
                  two other symbols, the aegis and the globe, as imperial symbols of divinity.</p>
               <p>It may seem surprising that Constantine should allow his portrait with the radiate head to be placed upon his coinage after his own conversion
                  to Christianity which took place in 312. But perhaps the symbol had long ceased to have any special meaning. Yet it is somewhat remarkable
                  because the radiate head occurs but seldom on his coins and medallions. Two instances are the gold binios of the mint of <placeName>Nicomedia</placeName> showing the radiate bust of Constantine to the left (<persName>Cohen</persName>, Vol. VII, no. 391, p. 321). A third
                  example is a gold binio (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 683) with the radiate bust to the right, of the mint of Tréves. All three pieces are
                  to be dated after 324, a dozen years, therefore, after the conversion to Christianity. There must be some special reason why this pagan type
                  is <pb n="46"/> perpetuated so long on the coinage. And we find an explanation if we look more closely into the accounts of various authors
                  who describe the life of Constantine. The orator, Eumenius, who pronounced the official panegyric addressed to Constantine at Tréves in July,
                  310, described Constantine's descent from Claudius II by Constantius Chlorus, and notes Constantine's cult of the Sun-god who was the
                  hereditary deity of the second Flavian dynasty. The coins showing various types relating to the Sun-god, namely, the bust of the sun, the
                  Sun-god in a chariot, and the inscription <hi rend="italic">Sol Invictus</hi> begin about 309. It is due to this tradition of the solar origin
                  of the dynasty, that Constantine allowed his head to be represented as radiate long after his conversion. When the city of Constantinople was
                  formally inaugurated as the capital of the Empire in 330, a gigantic statue of Apollo Helios, with features assimilated to those of
                  Constantine, was erected in the Forum of the city on a column of porphyry which is still standing to-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">The Sun-god as hereditary deity of Constantine</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="47"/>
               <p>This statue represented the Emperor as a Solar god. It may have been, as <persName>Maurice</persName> thinks, planned by the pagan
                  officials of the Senate who presided in general over the organization of the new capital. Nevertheless, the Emperor did not forbid its
                  erection although he intended to make Constantinople a Christian city and would not allow the performance of any ceremonies connected with the
                  pagan cults. Art types, however, persist long after the practice of the cults originally connected with them.</p>

                     <placeName>Augusta Trevirorum</placeName>
                  </hi>) goes back to the old Gallic tribe of the <placeName>Treviri</placeName>, whose chief town was besieged by <persName>Julius
                     Caesar</persName>. It lay on the right bank of the Moselle about 90 miles from <placeName corresp="#geonames_3358131">Coblenz</placeName>
                  where the Moselle joins the <placeName corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</placeName>. Whether it was surrounded by walls in the time of
                     <persName>Julius Caesar</persName> is not known, but it was fortified certainly by <persName>Augustus</persName> in 15 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and a colony was established there under Claudius. In 69 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the walls of Tréves are
                  mentioned by Tacitus (<hi rend="italic">Historiae</hi> IV, Ch. 62). In the <pb n="48"/> second half of the third century, the town was
                  surrounded by strong walls and the city became the residence of the Roman emperors, and a vantage point from which to wage war against the
                  Germanic tribes. Diocletian, at the time of the re-organization of the Empire, made Tréves the capital not only of <placeName>Belgica</placeName> Prima but of the whole of <placeName>Gaul</placeName>. For a century, from the time of Maximianus to Maximus, 286 to
                  388, it was the royal residence for all the Emperors except <persName>Julian</persName>, who lived in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. It was the administrative centre from which <placeName>Gaul, Britain</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> were ruled and was called the "Second Rome" and the "<placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> beyond the Alps."</p>
               <p>There must necessarily have been many enlargements of the encircling walls from time to time, but there is now no trace of the early walls and
                  those now surviving belong to the city at its greatest extent. The accompanying ground plan of the city of Tréves, adapted from the copper
                  plate in <persName>Schmidt's</persName> work on Tréves (see Special, References), shows the lines of the old Roman wall. The ancient city
                  extended much farther to the east and southwest than at the present time.</p>

               <pb n="49"/>
               <p>This is shown clearly on the plan on which the mediaeval walls with the encircling boulevards are shown. On the northeast side the modern city
                  wall is practically identical with the Roman wall. The wall which bounds the city on the side opposite the river runs close to the ancient
                  amphitheatre indicated on the plan and meets at a sharp angle the southwest wall which runs about parallel to the northeast wall through the
                  suburb of <persName>St. Mathias</persName> and reaching to the river. The area enclosed within these fortifications was more than double
                  that of the modern city and the ancient population has been estimated as more than double the population of the city in 1905.</p>
               <p>There has been practically no published discussion concerning the gateway represented on the Constantinian medallion (Pl. IV) in numismatic

                  <persName>Donaldson</persName> does not mention the medallion in his <hi rend="italic">Architecture Numismatica,</hi> although the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> example was <pb n="50"/> illustrated in <persName>Cohen's</persName>

               </p>
               <p>Upon first investigation after a comparison of the imposing remains of the gateway known as the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>, one of
                  the finest Roman gateways still standing, with the representation on the medallion, the natural conclusion would be that this gateway, which
                  it would seem must have been the principal <hi rend="italic">porta</hi> of the city, is the one figured on the coin. This has probably been
                  the belief of most archaeologists familiar with the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> and the medallion. The fact that there appear to be
                  four towers instead of two is in no wise disturbing, although the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> had but two, for coins seldom bear
                  representations of archaeological objects which are faithful in detail. Furthermore, the <pb n="51"/> representation is of the whole walled
                  enclosure with numerous towers, and the two outer towers on the medallion probably represent single towers situated at intervals on the
                  encircling wall (of whose existence the remains to-day bear evidence) and do not belong to the gate proper.</p>
               <p>But a closer study of the walls and plan of the city has revealed the fact that the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> cannot possibly be
                  the gateway represented on the binio. In the first place, the Moselle River does not flow closely enough to the city walls in the vicinity of
                  the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> for it to form naturally an integral part of a picture of the city as seen from this gateway. In the
                  second place, there is the detail of the bridge clearly depicted with its arches across the river; and, as the extant remains of this bridge
                  and the results of Schmidt's detailed study of the walls show, there must have been an important <hi rend="italic">porta</hi> at the
                  bridge-head in the west wall. (Plan of Tréves, Gate 4.) Finally, the situation of the ruins now extant, the Emperor's palace, the
                  amphitheatre, etc. <pb n="52"/> (Plan of Tréves), indicates clearly that not only was there an important gate at the bridge-head, but that
                  this was the principal entrance to the city although, unfortunately, all traces of it are now lost. But most happily in pursuing the inquiry
                  further, the writer was rewarded by discovering that the late compilation, known as the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Trevirorum</hi> (about 1132),
                  contains a full, albeit somewhat florid, description of all the gateways of Tréves and confirms fully the above deductions, by describing the
                  bridge gate as the most elaborate structure of all.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There were four gateways leading into the city of <placeName>Augusta Trevirorum</placeName>. The best known of these is the only one now
                  extant, the so-called <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>, which was also known as the Porta Romana and the Porta Martis, and lies about the
                  centre of the northeast wall. (See Plan of Tréves, Gate 1.) A second gate was situated at the opposite end of the long street to which the
                     <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> formed one terminus. (Gate 2.) While a third gate probably was situated about the <pb n="53"/> middle
                  of the east wall, and from all accounts was formed from the openings of the amphitheatre itself. (Gate 3.) A fourth gate is known to have
                  existed at the head of the bridge across the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2991627">Moselle</placeName> and formed the terminus to a long
                  street which led diagonally into the main artery which connected the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> (Gate 1) and the southernmost gate
                  (Gate 2) and joined it at the market place (Gate 4). These gates are all described in the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Treverorum usque ad Annum

               </q>
               <q>"And so that royal city flourished, supreme in every form of excellence as it was said, surrounded by walls and a rampart, fortified by tall
                  strong towers and possessed of four public gateways facing the four quarters of the earth, of which the first looking toward the north was
                  built of square blocks, fastened together not with cement but by iron in a marvellous manner; it was called the <placeName>Porta
                     Nigra</placeName> — the Black Gate, or the Porta Martis, the Gateway of War; as regards the second, which lies toward the east, it is called the
                  Porta Alba, <pb n="55"/> the White Gate. ... Now, the third which looks toward the south is called the Porta Media, or Middle Gate, because as
                  one enters the city by it, the road leads right through the middle of the town. But the fourth gate situated toward the west was built of
                  quadrangular blocks and was a very famous structure. At its exit, there was a roadstead or harbour for the ships which sailed up and down the
                  aforementioned stream. This same gateway was marvellously adorned with gold and precious stones artificially wrought, so that at night these
                  ships might be illuminated as it were by the sun, the moon and the stars, whence, on account of its marvellous construction, the gate was
                  called 'The Famous Gateway.'"</q>
               <p>From this description we may confidently assign the names of the gates as follows : 1. <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>. 2. Porta Media.
                  3. Porta Alba. 4. Porta Incluta. The gateway on our medallion as has been indicated can scarcely be any other than the fourth gate called
                  Incluta Porta in the <hi rend="italic">Gesta.</hi> The coin type includes <pb n="56"/> the Moselle River in the foreground, and a bridge built
                  upon arches leading to the gate. A second passage in the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi>, Ch. IV, describes the bridge gate, as follows:
                     <q>Quarta porta versus occidentem constructa est ad littus Mosellae quae mira sui operositate et turrium incomparabili pulchritudine
                     ceteras portus excelluit et ob hoc <hi rend="italic">inclytae portae</hi> vocabulum sumpsit. Hanc portam stellis ex auro factis mirabiliter
                     pinxere, quae portui navium proximum nocte dieque luminis officium praebuere. "The fourth gateway towards the west was erected on the banks
                     of the Moselle, which, on account of its marvellously elaborate construction, and the incomparable beauty of its towers, excelled the other
                     gateways, and for this reason took the name of the <hi rend="italic">Famous Gate.</hi> This gateway is wonderfully decorated with stars
                     made of gold which offered by day and by night a very near substitute for light to the ship harbour."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">The bridge gateway, Incluta Porta</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That portion of the description which relates to the decoration of the bridge <pb n="57"/> gate or Incluta Porta with gold and precious stones
                  for the purpose of illuminating the ships which came to anchor near the bridge, may be dismissed as romancing on the part of the writer of the
                     <hi rend="italic">Gesta.</hi> There is no need, however, to question the general accuracy of the description. The modem bridge across the
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_2991627">Moselle</placeName> is constructed upon the ancient Roman buttresses which formed a powerful
                  structure, and must have been the sole bridge for the ancient Roman city. The <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi> (Ch. V) bears witness to the
                  importance and powerful character of this bridge. After mentioning the Temple and Arch of <placeName>Mercury</placeName>, the passage reads
                  : <q>Non longe ab hinc super Mosellam ex magnis lapidibus ferro plumboque cunpactis pontem construxere quem nulla vetustas labefactare nulli
                     fluctus possunt dissolvere. " Not far from here, across the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2991627">Moselle</placeName>, there was built
                     a bridge of huge blocks, fastened with iron and lead, which neither age could weaken, nor the current of the river destroy.</q>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">The Moselle bridge</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This description is borne out by the modem investigation of the bridge in the work of Ch. <persName>W. Schmidt</persName> (see Special
                  References). The <placeName>Moselle bridge</placeName> is said to be 631 feet long between the land buttresses, but was originally longer.
                  The extreme pier on the left, and the two piers on the right, are constructed of large blocks of blue limestone, said to have come from the
                  neighborhood of <persName>Namur</persName> in <placeName>Belgium</placeName>. These are fastened together without mortar, being held
                  in place by metal clamps, just as the blocks of the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> were fastened together, as is evidenced by the
                  monument itself, which is still extant, and the testimony of the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi> (Ch. xxIII). Five other buttresses are
                  constructed of basaltic lava, said to be from <placeName>Mayenne</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_11071621">Normandy</placeName>, <placeName>France</placeName>. There are eight arches, but the spans themselves are not of Roman origin, but later.
                  The transportation of these great blocks must have entailed an enormous cost, and this factor will be considered when we take up the question
                  of the date of the walls, towers, and bridge.</p>
               <pb n="59"/>
               <p>A glance at our ground plan of Tréves shows that the bridge lies in a straight line leading towards the ruins of the Emperor's palace, along
                  which, very probably, lay an ancient road. Thus the bridge gateway would have formed the principal entry to the ancient city whose centre was
                  near the palace and amphitheatre of which the remains are still to be seen. It would be natural enough then, that the gateway chosen for
                  representation on the medallion should be the Incluta Porta.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Date of the walls</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The date of the walls of Tréves and the gateway now standing, the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>, has been the subject of considerable
                  discussion. Our authorities on the whole, however, are pretty well agreed that the archaeological indications point to a period not earlier
                  than that of Postumus, about 258, and not as late as the time of Valentinian I and Gratianus, 364–383. <persName>Schmidt</persName>,
                  whose opinion is regarded as the most correct by <persName>Behr</persName>, who has written the most recent work on the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>, believes that Constantine the Great was principally responsible for the erection of <pb n="60"/> the great
                  public buildings, walls, and bridge of Tréves. He argues that no other Emperor resided in Tréves so long as Constantine the Great, and no
                  other Emperor is mentioned by ancient writers in connection with the restoration of the city and reconstruction of the monuments. Constantine
                  the Great lived in Tréves in 306, 307, 313–316, then again, in 329 and 331, at certain intervals. The panegyrist, Eumenius, says in an oration
                  to Constantine, delivered in 310 on the occasion of an anniversary of the foundation of Tréves, which was also the Quinquennial anniversary of
                  Constantine — "May a new foundation day of the city be celebrated on account of the benefactions of the Emperor since the city walls have been
                  restored throughout and since the city is in a certain sense grateful for the devastation suffered some time ago." From this passage we learn
                  that Constantine the Great had just ornamented the city anew and reconstructed its monuments.</p>
               <p>Since the archǣological investigations <pb n="61"/> in general tend to establish the first half of the fourth century as the date of the
                  principal monuments now standing, and since Constantine chose the Incluta Porta and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2991627">Moselle</placeName> bridge for representation on his medallion, we may reasonably conclude from his long period of residence in this capital,
                  that the planning and reconstruction of the principal defences and public buildings was due to his initiative.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Incluta Porta on the medallion</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> (see Frontispiece) (Gate No. 1, Plan of Tréves), is one of the best preserved among Roman fortified
                  gateways, and it may be worth while to examine it briefly as it probably furnishes the best model for reconstructing in imagination the now
                  destroyed Bridge Gateway, the Incluta Porta, shown on the medallion. The structure consisted of two fighting towers or <hi rend="italic">propugnacula</hi> for the purposes of defense connected by galleries over a double entrance. The Incluta Porta, from the coin, appears to
                  have had but one opening, closed by doors, doubtless of bronze, and it seems to have had four towers rounding outwards instead of two. <pb n="62"/> But, of course, it is never safe to trust to the details given in the die-engraving of an ancient coin representing an
                  architectural work. Furthermore, the conservatism innate in architectural construction makes one suspect that the Incluta Porta was built in
                  about the same way as the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> and other gateways seen on coins of <persName>Anchialos</persName> and
                     <persName>Bizya</persName> in <placeName>Thrace</placeName>, <placeName>Markianopolis</placeName>, <placeName>Nikopolis</placeName>, and <placeName>Trajanopolis</placeName> in Mésia Inferior (see <persName>Donaldson's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Architecturei Numismatica</hi> and <persName>B. Pick's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Die Antiken Ménzen Nord-Griechenlands</hi>, Pt. 1, Plates iii and xx). There were probably just two towers in the Incluta
                  Porta proper like those of the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>. The other two shown to right and left as higher towers in the medallion
                  undoubtedly represent merely an attempt to show two single towers at distant points on the encircling wall. The tops of three more appear on
                  the wall in the distance. The slanting lines at the top between inner and outer towers reveal this attempt at perspective. The die-engraver
                  has merely tried to give the effect of courses of stone <pb n="63"/> blocks laid one above another; further than that there are no indications
                  of windowed openings or stories. From the description in the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi>, however, and the designation of the "Famous Gateway
                  " borne by the Bridge Gate, we should imagine a structure more massive and higher than the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>. Doubtless,
                  it was also more ornate than the <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName> in its original state, and a detail of its ornamentation is supplied by
                  our medallion which shows a statue of Constantine above the entrance, probably to be thought of as occupying a niche just over the doors and
                  far below the tops of the towers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is the unique gold medallion of Valentinian I of which the rather remarkable history has been told in the beginning of this article.</p>
               <p>Valentinian I was chosen Emperor in his forty-third year by the officers of the army at <placeName>Nicaea</placeName> in <placeName>Bithynia</placeName> in 364 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and soon after named his brother Valens as colleague with him in the Empire on
                  equal terms. He gave Valens the title of <persName>Augustus</persName> at the outset and they divided the Empire between them,
                  Valentinian taking <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, <placeName>Illyricum</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and the <placeName>Gauls</placeName>, <placeName>Britain</placeName>, and <placeName>Africa</placeName>, while to Valens fell the Eastern half of the <placeName>Balkan peninsula</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> as far as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>. As this division was made soon after Valentinian's election (Ammianus Marcellinus, Chaps. xxv-xxx,
                  makes it pretty clear that Valen- <pb n="66"/> tinian was intimidated into naming a co-ruler from the first), it may seem surprising to note
                  that the mint at which our medallion was issued is that of Antioch in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> which belonged
                  within the empire of Valens. It is not necessary to assume, however, that the medallion must therefore have been struck within the short
                  period when the two brothers were passing through the chief cities of the district near Nicéa and arranging the allotment of the Empire. For
                  it was customary for coemperors as long as they were on friendly terms to strike coins each in the name of the other at mints over which each
                  ruler exercised direct control. Thus coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName> were issued from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> mint which had belonged to Constantius Chlorus and passed directly into Constantine's
                  power, and coins of Constantine were issued from the mint of Antioch which had belonged to <persName corresp="#nomisma_licinius">Licinius</persName> after the defeat of Maximinus I Daza in 313. So too Valentinian and Valens issued coins for each other in mints outside
                  their own immediate personal control.</p>
               <pb n="67"/>
               <p>To what period then and to what event must the medallion be assigned? The reverse type of the victorious Valentinian with the inscription <hi rend="italic">Gloria Reipublicae</hi> suggests an important military triumph. This, it may be proposed, was in all likelihood the victory
                  won at the battle of Solicinium on the Neckar in 368. At least, this battle marks the successful completion of a campaign against the Alemanni
                  for which Valentinian prepared for two years. Valentinian had fallen ill in 367 when Gratianus was made Augustus at the tender age of eight,
                  and he wished to assure the safety of his Empire and, also, to add military glory to his son's name. The attack against the barbarians lasted
                  from June 17 to July 31, 368. The victorious outcome of this campaign, well-known in Valentinian's military career, is the one event to which
                  we can point as the most probable occasion for the issue of this medallion.</p>
               <p>The figure of Valentinian I on this medallion should be compared with the figure of Valentinian on a silver disc in the <pb n="68"/> Museum of
                  Geneva (Mrs. <persName>A. Strong</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Apotheosis and After Life</hi>, Pl. xiii, 2, and <persName>F. de
                     Mély</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Monuments Piot, 1900,</hi> (Vol. <hi rend="bold">VII,</hi> p. 74, Fig. 2.) The Emperor is represented on
                  this disc as the central figure addressing a group of his soldiers. He holds in his right hand a globe surmounted by a figure of Victory who
                  is approaching him with a wreath and palm branch, while his left arm is resting upon and supporting the vexillum exactly as on the medallion.
                  The Emperor is, also, in military dress but the head is facing forward and the body is more firmly set in a frontal pose than on our
                  medallion. Another difference is the fact that the Emperor's head is surrounded by a large solar aureole on the silver disc.</p>
               <p>The general similarity of the two pieces, however, is sufficient to warrant our suggesting that both of these small works of art may have been
                  inspired by a larger work of art representing the Emperor as victor after some signal triumph. The disc is dated by <persName>M. de
                     Mély</persName> in the year 370, but the reason for selecting this year <pb n="69"/> is not given. This corresponds with the date which has
                  been here suggested, namely, the period immediately following the victory over the Alemanni in 368.</p>

                  </hi>
               </head>
               <p>Any one who examines attentively a large number of Roman medallions will come to the conclusion now generally held among numismatists that the
                  ancient medallion is not a medal in the modem sense. According to its fundamental nature, the medallion is a coin. Whether it circulated like
                  a coin or not, it shows the typical characteristics of a coin. The term medallion is usually considered rather unfortunate in that it connotes
                  the idea of a medal and thus gives a wrong impression. On the other hand, the long-continued use of the word will make it difficult to oust it
                  from our numismatic vocabulary. Furthermore, there is no single word which can be used as a substitute. The ancients had no separate word to
                  describe that class <pb n="70"/> of coin issues in the Roman series which some modem writers very aptly term coinmedals, or medallic coins,
                  that is, pieces of higher denomination than usual, multiples, whole or fractional, of the aureus and solidus in gold, the denarius and
                  antoninianus in silver, and of the <hi rend="italic">as</hi> in bronze. But the word <hi rend="italic">numisma</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">nomisma,</hi> the Greek word equivalent to <hi rend="italic">nummus</hi> "coin," came in course of time to designate coins which were out
                  of circulation and to be used in poetry of coins in general. In a passage in the Digest, Pomponius VII, I, 28, the word is used in describing
                  old coins:</p>
               <p>Numismata aurea vel argentea vetera quibus pro gemmis uti solent — "Ancient gold and silver coins which they are accustomed to use as
                  jewelry."</p>
               <p>This is an interesting passage furnishing ancient testimony as to the use of coins and medallions in jewelry, although the word <hi rend="italic">numismata</hi> here cannot be taken as designating medallions only, but means rather coins which were no longer in
                  circulation. The generic word <hi rend="italic">forma</hi> combined <pb n="71"/> with adjectives derived from distributive numerals to
                  indicate the multiple, <hi rend="italic">formae binariae, ternariae</hi>, etc., is found in the passage from the Life of <persName corresp="#nomisma_severus_alexander">Alexander Severus</persName> quoted at length below. The word "binio " occurs in a description of a coin
                  of Gallienus, and the word " quaternio " is found on a quadruple antoninianus of Valerian and Gallienus (<hi rend="italic">Rev. Num</hi>.,
                  1855, p. 392). Thus there is ample justification for the terms binio, ternio, quaternio, quinio, senio, etc.</p>
               <p>The Roman medallions, however, were not merely multiple coins. If that were so, we should expect to find them in larger quantities, to see
                  them in proportionate numbers at different periods, whereas they are scarcer than any other issues. For the first two centuries of the Empire,
                  gold and silver medallions are extremely rare. Only two gold medallions of the First Century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> have come down —
                  one of Augustus found at Pompeii in 1759 and now in the Naples Museum, and one of Domitian, formerly in the French collection, but now lost.
                  It is only in the Third Century <pb n="72"/> under Caracalla and Elagabalus that large numbers of gold medallions appear to have been coined.
                  In the Fourth Century, gold medallions are fairly abundant; and with this increase in number comes also an increase in the size, for it is
                  only at this period that the gold medallion takes on that fundamental quality of the modem medal which is an unrestricted diameter, a feature
                  which links the Roman medallion in gold of this period more closely to the modern medal than in its origin. But while the large gold
                  medallions of the Late Empire suggest the modem medal most vividly, and have certainly this much in common with the medal, namely, a
                  commemorative purpose, it is easy to indicate the points of difference between the Roman medallion in general, and the modem medal.</p>
               <p>Briefly stated, there is, first, the fact that their issue was entirely controlled by the state, that is, imperial authority. This is true
                  also of the bronze medallions struck under senatorial authority and designated as senatorial issues by the <pb n="73"/> letters S. C. on the
                  reverse, for the senate's power to strike these pieces was delegated by imperial authority. No private individual, or private society or
                  association of individuals, could issue a medallion as may, of course, be done with a modern medal. Only the Emperor, and those persons whom
                  he designated, could be represented on the medallions. No artist, statesman, general, or philosopher had this privilege. Secondly, the metal
                  and the weights of the medallion are in strict accordance with the standard existing for the coinage. The silver and bronze medallions suffer
                  the same periodical decline and renewal in fineness of metal as the coinage, and the weights vary with the rise and fall of the weights of the
                  coins. Thirdly, the restricted diameter of the medallion up to a very late period indicates the adherence to the conventional standard of size
                  set by the actual coin units of which they were the multiples, weight being expressed by the thickness of the flan (this refers chiefly to
                  bronze). Again, the types are almost exclusively concerned <pb n="74"/> with the Emperor, his protecting deities, his conquests, his
                  festivals, the provisioning of the city, the solidarity and loyalty of his army. Lastly, while the medallions do not bear marks of value,
                  which is true also of coins with rare exceptions, still they bear in the exergue mint marks at the same period at which mint marks are
                  regularly found on coins.</p>
               <p>Turning to the historical evidence, we find this most convincing. The most important literary text describing medallions in their relation to
                  coins is found in the passage (Chapter 39) in the Life of <persName corresp="#nomisma_severus_alexander">Alexander Severus</persName> by
                  Lampridius, here quoted in full.</p>
               <q>Vectigalia publica in id contraxit, ut, qui decem aureos sub Heliogabalo praestiterant, tertiam partem aurei praestarent, hoc est tricesimam
                  partem. Tuncque primum semisses aureorum formati sunt; tunc etiam, quum ad tertiam aurei partem vectigal decidisset, tremisses; dicente
                  Alexandra, etiam quartarios futuros, quod minus non posset : quos quidem jam formatos in <pb n="75"/> moneta detinuit, exspectans ut, si
                  vectigal contrahere potuisset, et eosdem ederet : sed quum non potuisset per publicas necessitates, conflari eos jussit, et tremisses tantum
                  solidosque formari. Formas binarias, termarias et quaternarias, et denarias etiam, atque amplius, usque ad bilibres quoque et centenarias,
                  quas Heliogabalus invenerat, resolvi praecepit, neque in usu cuiusquam versari, atque ex eo his materiae nomen inditum est, quum diceret plus
                  largiendi hanc esse imperatori causam, si, quum multos solidos minores dare possit, dans decem vel amplius una forma, triginta et quinquaginta
                  et centum dare cogeretur — "He lessened the public taxes to this degree that those who under Elagabalus had paid ten aurei should pay a third
                  of an aureus, namely, the thirtieth part of the old tax. Then, for the first time, half-aurei, or semisses, were struck; and also third aurei,
                  or tremisses, when he had lowered the tax to the third of an aureus. He was also intending to issue quarter-aurei, the lowest tax possible,
                  and these were in fact already struck, and Alexander held <pb n="76"/> them in the mint in the expectation that if he could reduce the tax, he
                  could put them into circulation. But when he was unable to do so because of public necessities, he ordered them to be melted down and only
                  tremisses and whole aurei to be struck. He ordered also the melting down of the double, triple, and quadruple aurei, and likewise the pieces
                  of ten aurei and more, even up to the two-pound pieces, and also those of one hundred aurei which Elagabalus had invented, and forbade that
                  they should be used as money (lit. forbade that they should be found in any one's use). From that time on, the name of bullion was given to
                  these pieces. He stated that these pieces had compelled the Emperor to distribute largesses on a greater scale (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>.
                  than he wished), since in place of giving several aurei (lit., whole pieces, or units, <hi rend="italic">solidi)</hi> of less value, he was
                  obliged, if he distributed pieces of ten aurei or more, to give sums of thirty, fifty, and one hundred aurei."</q>
               <p>It is particularly to the sentence beginning <hi rend="italic">formas binarias</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ternarias et quaternarias</hi>, that we
                  wish to call attention. <pb n="77"/> Lampridius here states that Alexander Severus ordered the multiple aurei, namely, the double, triple,
                  quadruple, and more aurei, to be melted down and retired from circulation. The context shows that these multiples were hitherto regarded as
                  part of the regular currency, one of the chief uses of these larger denominations being their distribution by the Emperor as largesses or
                  liberalities. The command that these pieces be withdrawn from circulation and be considered merely as bullion is mentioned by Lampridius in
                  immediate connection with the discussion of new coin denominations — these were the tremissis, or third-aureus, which was struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_severus_alexander">Alexander</persName> to facilitate payment of taxes, and a projected issue, the
                  quarteraureus, which was struck but not issued and subsequently melted down. Lampridius, who wrote about a century after Alexander, is in
                  error in his first, and incidental, statement about the divisions of the aureus, namely, that the half-aurei, <hi rend="italic">semisses
                     aureorum</hi>, were first issued under Alexander, for of course we find the <pb n="78"/> quinarius aureus at the beginning of the Empire.
                  The third-aureus, also, which he assigns to Alexander (222–235 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>), as the inventor is, according to numismatic
                  evidence, first known under Valerian (253-260 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>). The historian is probably led to attribute the introduction of
                  the tremissis to Alexander on account of Alexander's reform of the taxes which might naturally have called forth such an issue. As coins of
                  this denomination are lacking, however, before Valerian's time, the statement must remain unconfirmed.</p>
               <p>Lampridius is at great pains to depict Alexander in his character as Severus, pointing out in the following chapter, 40, his preference for
                  extreme simplicity in dress and manners. It was from motives of economy that the "pieces of two, three, four, ten, and more aurei, up to
                  pieces of two-pounds and even one hundred-aurei, which Elagabalus had invented," were consigned to the melting pot. This sentence is of prime
                  importance, for it attributes to Elagabalus the first issue of medallions of phenomenal weight. The <pb n="79"/> text allows the
                  interpretation of the clause "which Elagabalus had invented" as restricted to the words immediately preceding, namely, "the two-pound and
                  100-aurei pieces." Again, there are in existence to-day medallions of the denominations known as binios, ternios, and quaternios from the
                  period preceding Elagabalus, which confirms the above interpretation. But in detail Lampridius has fallen into error. For in the time of <persName>Alexander Severus</persName>, the aureus having a weight of 6.54 grams was struck on the basis of 50 to a Roman pound, 6.54 é 50 =
                  327.00 grams. Hence, the <hi rend="italic">bilibres</hi>, or two-pound pieces, would be precisely pieces of 100 aurei, and Lampridius, phrase
                     <hi rend="italic">usque ad bilibres guoque et centenarias</hi>, "even up to the two-pound pieces, and also those of 100 aurei," makes
                  nonsense. Probably the writer may have been thinking of pieces of 50 and 100 aurei which would be pound and two-pound pieces (327 grams and
                  .654 grams). <persName>M. Babelon</persName> remarks that the <hi rend="italic">formae bilibres</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">formae
                     centenariae</hi> are equivalent expressions <pb n="80"/> (<hi rend="italic">Traité des Monn. Gr. et Rom.</hi> I<hi rend="sup">1</hi> p.
                  529). <persName>Kenner</persName> (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> pp. 23 and 144) emends the text to read <hi rend="italic">usque ad
                     librales quoque et centenarias</hi> — "up to pound pieces and those of 100-aurei", which gives the required sense although probably not the
                  original words.</p>
               <p>It is interesting to consider the exact words used for the acts of demonetization attributed by Lampridius to Alexander. Of the projected
                  quarter-aurei pieces, he says <hi rend="italic">conflari eos iussit</hi> — "he ordered them to be melted down"; but of the multiple aurei
                  which Alexander wished to withdraw from actual use, he says " <hi rend="italic">Resolvi praecepit neque in usu cuiusquam versari</hi>, <hi rend="italic">atque ex eo his materiae nomen inditum est"</hi> — "He ordered them to be melted down and not to be found in anyone's
                  possession or use; and from that time on the name of bullion was given to these pieces" — that is to say, the command was to melt down these
                  pieces in due course as they were gathered into the treasury or mint, and meantime they were not to be circulated as currency but as mere gold
                     <pb n="81"/> bullion; the second part of the decree working immediately to restrict the power of legal tender which these pieces had
                  formerly possessed. Such an act would not have prevented a large number of the medallions from being retained as souvenirs, and encased in
                  frames and worn as jewelry, which was commonly done in the Fifth and Sixth Centuries, <hi rend="bold">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                  </hi> Whatever may have been the fate of the large medallions invented by Elagabalus — whether destroyed as the result of this decree, or in
                  later times, but one gold medallion of this Emperor exists to-day, a binio (<persName>Gnecchi</persName>, Pl I, 7). Of Alexander Severus,
                  a binio (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 267) of the year 225, and an octuple piece or double quatemio (<persName>Cohen</persName>, 406)
                  of the year 230 (the Decennalia) are known. Thus, Alexander appeared to have struck multiple aurei, but perhaps they were previous to his act
                  of demonetization. The formation of multiples in gold, to judge from what is extant and the literary testimony, was an arbitrary matter
                  resting with the Emperor and not part of the regular currency <pb n="82"/> system. Official and unofficial melting down in antiquity and
                  later, accounts for most of the present dearth of examples.</p>
               <p>The striking of medallions of unusual dimensions did not become a common imperial custom until the Fourth and, particularly, the Fifth and
                  Sixth Centuries, when they attained a really remarkable size. The famous medallion of Justinian I (527–565 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>) now
                  lost, discovered at <persName>Caesar</persName>ea in Cappadocia in 1751, (<hi rend="italic">Brit. Mus. Cat. of Byzantine Coins</hi>, p.
                  25, frontispiece), weighed 162.5 gr. equal to 36 solidi or half a Roman pound of 72 solidi, and measured 85 mm. in diameter. Similarly, a
                  medallion of Valens (364–378 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d</hi>) with the reverse <hi rend="italic">Gloria Romanorum</hi> (<persName>Kubitschek</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Ausgewahlte Romische Medaillons,</hi> 356) having a narrow frame but no ring for suspension weighs
                  about the same, 178.9 gr. The gold framed medallion of Constantius II (323–361 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>) (<persName>Kubitschek</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Ausgewéhlte Rémische Medaillons</hi>, No. 300), with the reverse <hi rend="italic">Gaudium
                     Romanorum</hi>, cannot now be weighed very exactly on account of its wide frame. The total <pb n="83"/> weight is 256.9 gr. and the
                  diameter 93 mm.; the medallion, itself, however measures 71 mm.</p>
               <p>Another medallion, like the two preceding pieces also in the Vienna Museum, surpasses all others known to-day in weight. It has a narrow gold
                  frame and perforated attachment with a total diameter of 92 mm. and weight of 412.72 gr. This is the piece bearing the bust of Valens and <hi rend="italic">Gloria Romanorum</hi> reverse. Discounting the frame, the medallion proper must be equivalent to 90 solidi or more, at 4.50
                  gr. each. This piece gives us a vivid idea of the pound and two-pound pieces of Elagabalus noted by Lampridius, for it weighs more than the
                  Roman pound of 327 gr., and of the medallions described by Gregory of Tours (<hi rend="italic">Hist. Franc.</hi> Ch. vi, 2) as follows:</p>
               <q>Aureos etiam singularium librarum pondere quos imperator misit, ostendit, habentes ab una parte iconam imperatoris pictam, et scriptum in
                  circulo: <hi rend="smallcaps">tiberii constantini perpetui augusti;</hi> ab alia vero parte habentes quadrigam <pb n="84"/> et ascensorem
                  continentesque scriptum: <hi rend="smallcaps">gloria romanorum.</hi> "He showed gold coins of the weight of a pound each which the Emperor had
                  sent, having on one side the portrait of the Emperor with the inscription around it ' of Tiberius Constantinus, forever Augustus,' and on the
                  other side, a quadriga and charioteer with the inscription <hi rend="italic">Gloria Romanorum "</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The simple word aurei (gold coins) is used here of these medallions, striking proof that the ancients had no distinct or separate word for
                  medallion. These very large medallions were, however, quite exceptional. According to the literary testimony, as we have seen, this species of
                  gold medallion began under Elagabalus, and, according to the existing specimens, these large pieces are found chiefly during the reign of
                  Constantius II and Valens. But the commonest denominations are the binios, double aurei and solidi, the ternios, quaternios, quinios, and
                  senios. The octuple solidus or double quaternio is rarely found.</p>
               <p>The Roman gold medallion, as has been <pb n="85"/> shown, occupies a place intermediate between the coin and the medal. It was, in fact, a
                  coin in all its external aspects, weight, metal, and types, but it certainly was not struck primarily for circulation, although no doubt
                  capable of circulating as currency. The same fundamental monetary character may be established in the case of the silver and bronze
                  medallions, although these may have been more easily absorbed into the regular currency, and have actually seen more circulation than the
                  gold. The two passages cited above (1) Lampridius (1st third of the Fourth Century) <hi rend="italic">Vita Alexandri Severi</hi>, Ch. 39, (2)
                  Gregory of Tours (Sixth Century) <hi rend="italic">Hist. Franc.</hi> VI, 2, indicate clearly the donative character of the gold medallion. We
                  have, also, a decree of the Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian of the year 348 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (Cod. Theod. 15. 9. 1) which
                  forbade the actors from distributing "heavier silver coins than those weighing one-sixtieth of a pound" (5.45 gr.). Such "heavier silver
                  coins" which the actors had formerly used must have been in fact <pb n="86"/> silver medallions, and the passage quoted confirmed the donative
                  nature of these pieces.</p>
               <p>The circumstance that many of the largest medallions have come down to us encased in ornamental frames or equipped with rings for suspension,
                  has naturally tended to support the argument as to the medallic nature of these pieces. Coins, however, are just as frequently found set in
                  gold to be worn as necklaces, bracelets, etc. Several large finds have yielded most remarkable treasures of this sort, One find made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_719819">Hungary</placeName>, near <placeName>Szilégy-Somlyé</placeName>, in 1797, brought to light as many as
                  24 Roman medallions. In this hoard were contained the unusually large framed medallions of the Vienna Numismatic Collection with the heads of
                  Constantius II, Valens and Gratianus.</p>
               <p>A second large find of gold jewelry, including pieces set with coins and medallions, unearthed in 1909 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> (<persName>Dennison</persName>, <hi rend="italic">"A Gold Treasure from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>")</hi> is of great interest in this connection, the objects in this find ranging in date from <pb n="87"/> the Third to the Sixth Century; the majority, however, belonged to the latter century. The goldsmith's work on the pectorals and
                  medallions is regarded as of <placeName>Egyptian</placeName> or Syrian origin, and differs decidedly from the style of work on the Vienna
                  medallions which were found in Hungary. The frames of the medallions from Hungary are characterized by solid decorative bands, whereas those
                  from the <placeName>Egyptian</placeName> find are of more delicate workmanship with wire coils, chiselled work, raised spirals, and, very
                  frequently, openwork designs.</p>
               <p>From the find place of the Vienna medallions (Szilégy-Somlyé in Hungary, which was in the ancient province of Dacia which became lost to the
                  Roman Empire in 274<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> and from the style of art of their frames, <persName>Kenner</persName> has inferred that
                  they were made into objects of jewelry outside the Roman Empire and were worn particularly by barbarian chieftains who received them as gifts
                  from the princes of the Empire. The recent find in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> disposes of this theory as
                  applying to all medallions of this <pb n="88"/> class for the objects in it were produced within the bounds of the Empire. Furthermore, we
                  have the statement of Pomponius (Dig. VII, 1. 28) above quoted to the effect that the ancients were accustomed to wear old gold and silver
                  coins as jewelry. And <persName>Dennison</persName> points out that the Sixth Century to which he assigns the large medallion of
                  Theodosius I from the <placeName>Egyptian</placeName> treasure (No. 2 in the Freer Collection, the only coin-medallion proper, <hi rend="italic">i.e. struck</hi> piece in the find), was one of great luxury in which elaborate jewelled ornaments were worn by the wealthy
                  people of the time. The custom is exactly parallel with the modern practice of wearing coins as brooches and as pendants. Just as imitative
                  jewelry is designed from models, so the ancients wore jewelled pieces with medallions cast or repoussée in gold to imitate the originals as,
                  for example, those in the Morgan and Freer pectorals in the treasure from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. In
                  general, it may be inferred that the settings, if not in every case strictly contemporaneous, are not very far removed <pb n="89"/> from the
                  periods of the medallions themselves—that is to say, they belong to the late Roman period.</p>
               <p>A third find of gold medallions encased in frames is that made at Velp, in Gelderland, Holland, in 1715, which contained a large gold necklaee
                  to which were attached five large medallions of Honorius and Galla Placidia. The examples of these medallions in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> collection are from this find. The find place which is outside the bounds of the Roman Empire at the
                  time of Constantine is of interest in connection with the find in Hungary. A large proportion of the framed medallions shown in <persName>Gnecchi</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi> came from the Szilégy-Somlyé find, so that it would appear that of all the
                  framed pieces known the majority come from find spots outside the Roman Empire. Thus <persName>Kenner's</persName> contention that these
                  medallions were presentation pieces offered to chieftains of barbarous tribes by the Emperors is materially strengthened.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>O. Seeck</persName> and <persName>Fr. Kenner</persName> have both contributed admirable analyses of the purposes <pb n="90"/> for which the Roman medallion was created. The gold medallion was a form of money suited to the high position of the Augustus of
                  which the Emperor made use for the purpose of personal commemoration. The medallions must not be thought of as gifts or largesses handed out
                  to the people or soldiers. Their scarcity points rather to a restricted circle of privileged political and social acquaintances of the
                  Emperor. From the First Century on, the houses of distinguished men were visited by a large number of clients who were entertained on public
                  occasions by their patrons. At first, the entertainment took the form of a meal, but later a definite sum of money, the <hi rend="italic">sportula</hi>, was given as the equivalent of the chief meal of the day. and thus the entertainment of these somewhat troublesome guests
                  was compounded. Such <hi rend="italic">sportulae</hi> were presented on the birthday of the patron, his entry into a consulship, a marriage
                  anniversary, and other festival occasions. <hi rend="italic">Sportulae,</hi> furthermore, were given to those who dedicated a public building
                  and so on, and <pb n="91"/> were distributed among guests at a social entertainment. New Year's gifts also were quite general, and the
                  Emperors shared in the custom in that they received and demanded gifts of money at the Salutatio. A letter by Symmachus has come down to us in
                  which upon entry into his consulate, he accompanied the invitation with a gold solidus. There are several other letters which speak of the
                  gift of two solidi on the occasion of the marriage of his son. Presents of money could be offered, also, to men of rank and influence. The <hi rend="italic">sportula</hi> in the beginning was a very modest sum of money, just sufficient to buy with it, a mid-day meal. In the Fourth
                  Century it had developed into a very considerable gift, and this development started even in the Third Century. In harmony with this, the gold
                  medallions are very scarce and are almost entirely lacking in the first two centuries of the Empire, and silver also are extremely scarce.</p>
               <p>The types of the medallions reflect the motive which led to their issue, games, <pb n="92"/> triumphal processions, the first arrival in the
                  city, the departure for war, the Vota sacrifices or Jubilee of the reign, the introduction of the <persName>Caesar</persName> as princeps
                  inventutis, the marriage of the same, the birth of his children, the dedication of a temple, the <hi rend="italic">consecratio</hi>, — these
                  are the medallion types most commonly chosen.</p>
               <p>The medallion was well suited to commemorate the fame and prestige of the Emperor's family. The announcement of the appointment of a son to
                  the rank of <persName>Caesar</persName>, or of his wife to that of <persName>Augusta</persName>, had as object the increase of
                  public interest in the Emperor's household. Undoubtedly, there was complete distinction of person according to the official position and
                  political importance of the recipient. An example has been given already under medallion, No. 3, the Equis Romanus type, of an apparently
                  intentional gradation of weights. Other cases may be cited in which a given type was struck in a series of different weights.</p>

               <p>The institution of the Decennial games and the Vota goes back to the early period of the Empire (cf. <persName corresp="#viaf_49974517">Eckhel</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Doctrina Numorum Veterum</hi>, Vol. VIII, Ch. XIV, <hi rend="italic">De numis

                  suspicion of assuming royal power, undertook the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> or supreme control over his own provinces, <hi rend="italic">i.e:</hi> the non-senatorial, for a period of ten years, promising to pacify them completely within that time. When the first decade had
                  elapsed, he renewed his <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> for five years, and then again for five and later ten years and so on. The following
                  emperors, although receiving the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> for life, maintained the custom of periodical games and prayers for the happy
                  conclusion of the various periods and auspicious anticipation of the ensuing interval.</p>

               <p>Five gold medallions are known which were struck in the name of Constantine II to commemorate the Decennial celebration of 326–327 (Seeck, <hi rend="italic">Zeit. f. Num.,</hi> 1898).</p>

               <p>On this whole vexed question, see <persName>Maurice</persName>, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> Vol. I, pp. 468–469. Compare also <persName>Maurice</persName>, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> Vol. II, pp. 408, 410, where it is <pb n="99"/> demonstrated that the issues
                  of Constantius II, who became <persName>Caesar</persName> on Nov. 8, 324, showing the same type of uplifted head (as on the coin of <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName>, <persName>Cohen</persName>, 59) struck at the mint of Tarragona, cannot be
                  later than the end of 326, when this mint was closed; nor earlier than November, 324, when Constantius II was elevated to the rank of <persName>Caesar</persName>. In the natural course of events, Constantine the Great probably ordered his portrait, as described by <persName corresp="#nomisma_eusebius">Eusebius</persName>, to be placed upon his own medallions issued for his Vicennial celebrations, 325
                  and 326; and thereafter, on the occasion of the Decennial celebration of the <persName>Caesar</persName>s in 326, to be placed upon the
                  coinages of the <persName>Caesars</persName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_crispus">Crispus</persName>, <persName>Constantine Junior</persName>, and Constantius II. The solidi as well as the multiple issues were probably distributed as <hi rend="italic">sportulae</hi> to the important personages of the Empire, and to the chiefs of foreign states which sent delegations to congratulate the
                  Emperor on the anniversary.</p>

               <p>After the argument establishing the <hi rend="italic">Porta Incluta</hi> as the gateway represented on the medallion had been worked out, the
                  writer's attention was called to <persName>A. Blanchet's</persName> book on the Roman walled towns in <placeName>Gaul</placeName> (see
                  Special References). <persName>M. Blanchet</persName> begins (p. 89) with a description of two gateways of which remains are still <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> No. 1, the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>,</hi> and No. 2, the <hi rend="italic">Porta Mediana,</hi> whose ground plan <pb n="100"/> is about
                  the same as that of the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>,</hi> except that the bases of the towers are square instead of round. In a footnote, p. 92 (2), the
                  author enquires whether this second gateway may not have been the Porta Mediana noted in a <placeName>Latin</placeName> text of 853 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d</hi>. After describing gate No. 3, the gate of the amphitheatre, Blanchet continued, "It is admitted that a fourth
                  gate lay opposite to this near the site of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2991627">Moselle</placeName> bridge." In a footnote, p. 92
                  (3), he adds, "Later on I shall revert to a gold coin which probably represents this gate." On p. 331, after enumerating various instances of
                  coins representing 45 gateways, Blanchet continues, " Consequently certain exceptional pieces perhaps allude to particular constructions such
                  as the double solidus of Constantine the First, 306–337, struck at Treves, which represents not the gate alone, as has often been said, but
                  the walled enclosure of Treves flanked by seven towers and fortified with a double gate; in front is the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2991627">Moselle</placeName> and a bridge. Above the gate is the statue of the Emperor; to right and to left are crouching
                  prisoners (Pl. xxi, Fig. 3). One cannot refrain from connecting this small coin with a passage in the panegyric of Constantine which mentions
                  this Emperor's building activity." Note (4) adds, "The gate represented is facing the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2991627">Moselle</placeName> on the west of the city. It cannot, therefore, be the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>
                  </hi> which is on the north side and far from the <pb n="101"/> river. One must bear in mind artists' conventions, so important in ancient
                  art, in regard to these representations on coins; thus the great enclosure at Treves had more than seven towers." Note (5) to p. 331, quotes a
                  passage in the <hi rend="italic">Incerti Panegyr.</hi> vII, 22. (edition Baehrens p. 178): <hi rend="italic">"ita cunctis moenibus
                     resurgentem."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Putting all these references together, one may infer that Blancheit wished to identify the Treves gate on the medallion with the Bridge gate.
                  The important evidence supplied by the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Trevirorum,</hi> and the evidence derived from the statements of contemporaries
                  of Constantine as to his architectural constructions at Treves were, however, lacking, so that Blanchet did not bring out strongly the
                  identification of the gate as the <hi rend="italic">Porta Incluta.</hi>

               <p>In tracing the origin of the statement that the gate on the medallion should be identified with the <hi rend="italic">Porta Alba,</hi> a short
                  article by <persName>A. de Longpérier</persName> in the <hi rend="italic">Rev. Num.,</hi> 1864, on this same medallion was discovered
                  (see Special References). <persName>M. de Longpérier</persName> rejected the identification of the gate with the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Porta Nigra</placeName>
                  </hi> on the ground that, since the excavations, the gateway showed two large arches like the arch of Augustus at Nîmes. On the other hand,
                  the author does not accept the identification with the <hi rend="italic">Porta Alba</hi>, which gate is represented on the coinage of the
                  archbishops, Dietrich 965–977, and Ludolf 994–1008, of which the latter <pb n="102"/> bears the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">porta
                     alba</hi>. Quoting from the Antiquities of Tréves by Brower et Masen, <hi rend="italic">" Antiquitatum et Annalium Trevirensium libri XXV
                     "</hi> Liége, 1670, the author interestingly enough concludes that the gate on the medallion must certainly be identified with the fourth
                  gateway mentioned by these writers, namely, the <hi rend="italic">Porta Inclyta</hi> — the very conclusion which we had reached from quite
                  independent sources. Doubtless, these seventeenth-century writers whom <persName>Longpérier</persName> consulted derived their
                  information from the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Trevirorum,</hi> as is quite apparent from the quotation cited <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi>
                  p. 98): <q>"Quarta occidentem versus ad Mosellae allabentis litus excitata porta erat quae illustri specie artis, et magnificentia operis,
                     céteras longe superabat; ut ab ipsa structurae elegantia, porta <hi rend="italic">Inclyta</hi> diceretur. Haec porta aureis siderum figuris
                     exornata, et nocturno succensa ac late coruscans lumine, navigantibus phari loco proposita ipsum quoque urbis portum grata luce

                  <persName>Kenner</persName>, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 153, refers to the large framed medallions of Constantius II and Valens
                  as having been probably gifts of these emperors to barbarian chieftains whose 'Germanic' goldsmiths' art is recognizable in the frames. Their
                  find place, also, he thought, pointed to their having been worn by princes <pb n="103"/> outside the Roman Empire. On this point, it must be
                  recalled that the province of Dacia, where the find occurred, became Roman again under Constantine the Great in 328 (<persName>Maurice</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Num. Const.</hi> Vol. I, p. cxlvii).</p>
