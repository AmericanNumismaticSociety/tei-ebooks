            <p>Although this famous hoard of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms has already been partially studied and described by the present writer in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> for 1911 and 1912,<ref target="#Ch1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> there are nevertheless serious reasons for occupying ourselves, once more, with this extraordinary find. In the first place, the hoard at that time was only treated incidentally in explaining some observations made by the author as to the use of dies and the signatures of magistrates at certain of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s mints. The hoard is well worthy of more detailed attention than this. Also several thousand more coins from the find have since been seen and studied by the writer, and these contain about fifty important varieties not listed in the previous article. Finally, it
<pb n="2"/>
is highly desirable that several erroneous statements, deductions, and attributions there made be now corrected in the light of a wider experience with the intricacies of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> question. In those days the writer was but commencing his studies and was, naturally, only too ready to follow the lead of earlier writers, many of whose attributions have since proved fanciful.</p>
            <p>The material forming the basis of this study is composed of the following lots:</p>
            <p rend="hang">I Such coins in the writer’s own collection as came to him direct from the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> deposit, mostly purchased in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> shortly after the hoard’s discovery. Some of the duplicates in this lot have since been ceded by the writer to the <orgName type="ethnic">British</orgName> Museum, to the collection of the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> (since removed to the National Museum, <placeName>Washington</placeName>), and to certain private collectors.</p>
            <p rend="hang">II The collection of Gen. <persName>Ronald Storrs</persName>, and <persName>Mr. F. Munroe Endicott</persName>. These two
<pb n="3"/>
enthusiastic collectors of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage were fortunate to have been in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, in the diplomatic service of their respective countries, in the days of the hoard’s discovery. They early systematised their efforts and together were able to obtain specimens of practically every variety once contained in the find. Their collections were formed from the first pick of perhaps about four-fifths of the entire hoard.</p>
            <p rend="hang">III A lot of over a thousand specimens secured by <persName>M. Étienne Bourgey</persName> of <placeName>Paris</placeName>. This was probably the only portion of the find which had not previously been culled by <persName>Gen. Storrs</persName> or <persName>Mr. Endicott</persName>, and so contained a few rare varieties not represented in their collections. The greater portion of this lot was later purchased by the present writer, though only after numerous specimens had been sold by <persName>M. Bourgey</persName> to various collectors. Among these were <persName>Dr. Pozzi</persName> of <placeName>Paris</placeName>, <persName>M.

            <p rend="hang">IV A lot of over a thousand specimens which were brought back from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> by <persName>Mr. Azeez Khayat</persName> of this city. All of these coins, according to their general appearance and <persName>Mr. Khayat</persName>’s express statement, once belonged to the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> find. It was <persName>Mr. Khayat</persName> who first brought the hoard to the writer’s attention.</p>
            <p rend="hang">V Seventy tetradrachms in the <placeName>Toronto</placeName> Archaeological Museum which had been purchased by the Curator, <persName>Mr. C. T. Curelly</persName>, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> at the time of the hoard’s discovery.</p>
            <p rend="hang">VI Several small lots in the stocks of various dealers abroad, such as <persName>J.

            <pb n="5"/>
            <p rend="hang">VII A small group of tetradrachms in the Hermitage collection whose <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> provenance was kindly brought to my attention by the former curator, <persName>M. Alexis von Markoff</persName>.</p>
            <p rend="hang">VIII Certain small lots actually owned or kindly brought to my attention by <persName>Prof. Milne</persName>, <persName>Mr. E. J. Seltman</persName>, <persName>Mr. Endicott</persName>, <persName>Rev. Jeremiah Zimmerman</persName>, and others.</p>
            <p>Lot III is now entirely dispersed, with the exception of about a dozen specimens in very fine condition. Lot IV also no longer exists as an entity. Those pieces which had been secured from it by <persName>Mrs. Draper</persName>, <persName>Mr. Thomas B. F. Curtis</persName>, as well as many purchased by <persName>Mr. T. L. Elder</persName> of this city, have since passed into the possession of the author. The remainder of <persName>Mr. Khayat</persName>’s lot is now divided between the American Numismatic Society, <persName>Mrs. Agnes Baldwin Brett</persName>, <persName>Messrs. L. V. Case</persName>, <persName>V. Hammer</persName>, and the writer. Before disposing of his portion of <persName>Mr. Khayat</persName>’s lot, <persName>Mr. Elder</persName> published a series of six plates
<pb n="6"/>
in half tone showing the obverses and reverses of about 300 tetradrachms. It should be noted, however, that no. 98 on Plates I and II was not from the find at <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>. It is a tetradrachm of <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy I</persName> (type of Svoronos no. 265) from a hoard of these coins found also in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> but at a slightly later date than the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard of Alexanders.</p>
            <p>This material, amounting in all to 4826 specimens, constitutes what now remains to us of the great <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard. That this, however, is not the entire find is certain. Nevertheless, in the writer’s opinion, the material actually before us apparently comprises a very considerable portion of the original deposit.</p>
            <p>It is but natural that in the early days of the hoard’s discovery extravagant rumors concerning its size should have been current in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, and generally believed in. The somewhat unusual occurrence of many thousand <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms suddenly appearing upon the market not unnaturally gave the impression of a very much greater number having been found.
<pb n="7"/>
From impression to assertion is no very great step—and a good story seldom loses in the telling. Besides, the greater the find the more thrilling is the tale of treasuretrove. Above all, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> one has grown accustomed by actual experience to the unearthing of extraordinarily large hoards of ancient coin.<ref target="#Ch1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> It is evidently thus that the statement (given credit to everywhere in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>) that the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> find contained perhaps about fifteen thousand coins, and even twenty thousand or more, first gained currency. The writer’s personal experience, based on two trips to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> and many years’ acquaintance with collectors and dealers the world over, has made him somewhat skeptical of these large figures. In spite of a most diligent search, now continued over the space of more than fourteen years, no more than the above - mentioned 4826 specimens, which can be definitely traced to <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>, have been brought to light. In addition, he has seen perhaps some two or three hundred pieces (dispersed among the trays of various dealers and collectors) whose
<pb n="8"/>
appearance and previous history might suggest an assignment to our hoard. But because of the uncertainty they have not been included in our study.</p>
            <p>Doubtless many of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> coins were bought up by tourists in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> during the days when the coins were on the market—and such are probably definitely lost to us now. It is possible that others were exported to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> to supply a demand there, and the writer has indeed heard several statements to this effect. It is also quite probable that many of the poorer specimens were even melted down for their bullion value. To the writer’s own knowledge this actually did happen to a considerable portion of a large hoard of Athenian tetradrachms when their numbers and the comparatively restricted demand threatened a glut on the market. That this fate overtook any very large number of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>Alexanders cannot be proved, nor has the writer heard of any statement to that effect. The hoard apparently contained very few pieces disfigured by the punchmarks and counter-
<pb n="9"/>
stamps so often occurring on Greek coins found in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. To suppose that all such coins had been picked out and melted down before the remainder was placed on the market is hardly reasonable. There is always a certain demand for coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>, not only by collectors but also by noncollectors and tourists to whom the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> ever makes a strong appeal. The writer would not therefore place at any very high figure the number of <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> coins melted for their bullion, though he does not thereby mean to deny that this might not have happened to some.</p>
            <p>The most conservative estimates secured by the writer have always averaged around the figure ten thousand for the total number of coins once contained in the hoard. Unfortunately the original finders have never been discovered and it is they alone who would be in any position to know the real number of the coins found. The hoard in its entirety apparently never passed through the hands of any one person, with the result that we shall probably never
<pb n="10"/>
know the exact number of pieces it once contained. If, however, to the definite number of 4826 which we now possess we should add the very generous allowance of 2500, or even 3000, to cover such pieces as have disappeared in the trade or been melted down, it seems to the writer that we would have a figure tolerably close to the original number.</p>
            <p>Concerning the actual find-spot of the hoard nothing new has been ascertained since the previous article. Sig. Dattari’s account, kindly supplied to the writer in 1911, still holds good— though it might be well to modify somewhat, as we have seen, the probable number of coins found. In his letter Sig. Dattari stated that the find was made by natives, that its true <hi rend="italic">provenance</hi> was impossible to determine, that it eventually fell into the hands of several merchants residing in <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>, and that it took its name from this latter fact. He further stated that the deposit, containing anywhere from ten to twenty thousand tetradrachms, had been divided into five parts “of several thousand coins each”;
<pb n="11"/>
and that of these, one part had been sent to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>, the others to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> for disposal. Perhaps two of the groups (III and IV) described above represent two of these original divisions. If so, we then possess a slight corroboration of our suggestion that the hoard originally contained not more than some seven or eight thousand at the outside, as both <persName>M. Bourgey</persName>’s and <persName>Mr. Khayat</persName>’s lots numbered only a little over a thousand coins each.</p>
            <p>From a conversation on this subject recently held with <persName>M. Seymour de Ricci</persName>, who chanced to have been in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> engaged in his archaeological work at the time of the hoard’s discovery, it seems probable, in his opinion, that the hoard was really found somewhere in the vicinity of <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> and that this occurred sometime towards the end of 1905. <persName>M. de Ricci</persName> is also under the impression that the hoard contained over ten thousand coins, but states that he possesses no definite information upon which to base an opinion, other than hearsay and the statements current in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> at the time.</p>
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p>Although an unkind fate has willed it that the great <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard should have been broken up and largely scattered before it became accessible for study, our loss has been partially made good by the fact that, in all probability, we now know every variety it once contained. This good fortune is almost entirely due to the circumstance that <persName>Mr. Endicott</persName> and <persName>Gen. Storrs</persName> had been actively collecting in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> not very long after the great find was made. They displayed such an indefatigable enthusiasm and persistency in acquiring all varieties possible for their collections that few indeed can have escaped them. The present study would have been all but impossible, certainly it would have lost much of its scientific value, had it not been for the kind assistance and the access to their collections so readily granted by these gentlemen. Their collections, when combined, furnished practically all the varieties listed in the following pages. The remainder occurred either in that portion of <hi rend="bold">III</hi> which <persName>M. Bourgey</persName> sold to the writer, or among the specimens
<pb n="13"/>
which <persName>Dr. Pozzi</persName>, <persName>M. Saroglos</persName>, and the <orgName type="ethnic">British</orgName> Museum had previously selected from the same source.</p>
            <p>The material at our disposal has here been divided among the nine large geographical divisions in which there were active mints during the reigns of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip Arrhidaeus</persName>. These are: <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_peloponnesus">Peloponnese</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_propontis">Propontis</placeName>, South-western<placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_artaxias_iii">Cilicia</persName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> including <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylonia">Babylonia</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. Under these headings the coins have been again subdivided into series, each series attributable to one mint. This division of the material before us has been governed by a close study of the style, fabric, and appearance of the coins themselves.</p>
            <p>The mass of material placed at our disposal by such a find as that of <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> makes it comparatively simple to sort the coins into greater or lesser groups which are easily distinguishable, the one from the other, by marked differences in style and fabric. It is obvious that within the boundaries of each larger district of
<pb n="14"/>
the ancient world there had flourished, for many years, local schools of art exercising undoubted influence upon the diecutters of that particular region. By the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s arrival the technique and style peculiar to the local mint establishments had become crystallized into a more or less hard and fast tradition. As <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in each case apparently employed the local die cutters and mint appliances for the issue of his own coin, we are thereby greatly assisted in sorting and attributing, with a fair amount of accuracy and probability, the greater portion of his coins—although they all bear uniform types whether struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> or distant <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName>. For <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, then, we find a strong, vigorous, but heavy (one might say almost turgid) style. Though there is an unmistakeable similarity throughout the entire product of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>n mints, it soon becomes evident that die cutters of very diverse ability were working at one and the same time under the influence of a local style and tradition.</p>
            <p>The Peloponnesian issues show a higher
<pb n="15"/>
degree of art and a finer workmanship, but it seems evident that the die-cutters were accustomed to work on a smaller scale than that of the Attic tetradrachm. It is a fact that the contemporary gold staters and distaters of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> from this mint are much more pleasing and successful as works of art than the larger tetradrachms.</p>
            <p>The issues of the <placeName>Hellespontine</placeName> region are reminiscent of the preceding autonomous coinages of this district; while the issues for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_caria">Caria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lydia">Lydia</placeName> show to a striking degree the delicate and graceful influence of Ionian artists. The <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> head of the obverse has the soft contours and delicate modelling of that school, hardly suitable for the brawny hero of mythology. The <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> figure on the reverse is a dainty specimen of gem engraving. On the whole, while these coins show a perfection of ability and technique that is very attractive, they lack the vigor of the ruder <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>n products.</p>
            <p>The Cilician and North Syrian issues are, at first, merely copies of the immediately preceding satrapal coins struck here
<pb n="16"/>
by Mazaeus and other Persian governors.<ref target="#Ch1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> There can be no doubt but that the same die-cutters continued to work for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> after his conquest of these districts.</p>
            <p>On the Island of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>—as is only natural in view of its geographical position and commercial relations—we find a curious blending of the Greek art of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, the eastern art of <persName corresp="#nomisma_artaxias_iii">Cilicia</persName>, and the technical appliances and customs (fixed dies, etc.) of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The typically oriental style of the earlier Phoenician coinages was carried over onto the succeeding Alexandrine issues. Combined with this style there were also continued in use the local customs of each mint. Thus, unlike the other Phoenician mints, the Aradian issues were struck from loose dies as had always been the practice here; the coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> bear the abbreviated name of the local king; while the Sidonian issues are struck from fixed or adjusted dies and bear the regnal years of the reigning prince. At all of these mints we find the local style continuing to develop independently, up to a certain point. Later
<pb n="17"/>
it became influenced by the beautiful style of the coins emanating from the mint at Egyptian <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> are conspicuous for a style and character all their own, and destined to exercise a great and far spreading influence on the later coinages of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, and even portions of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>.</p>
            <p>For the newly opened mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> its great founder seems to have secured Greek artists of first rate ability. Their productions are well worthy the future fame of what was destined to become one of the greatest art centres of the ancient world. The dies that were here produced are exceedingly handsome, perhaps the finest to be found in the entire <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> series. These beautiful coins found instant approval at the many coining centres of the eastern Mediterranean and were soon being used as models in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_berytus">Berytus</placeName>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_citium">Citium</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amathus">Amathus</placeName>, and at several other as yet unidentified mints of the neighboring districts.</p>
            <p>Thus we are enabled to distinguish by
<pb n="18"/>
means of certain well defined lines of divergence, various groups in the general mass of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage. It is further quite possible, by paying strict attention to minor details of style and technique, and above all to the sequence of dies and their use in consecutive issues, to subdivide these larger groups into their component series—each series the issue of a single mint. Unfortunately it often proves to be a much more delicate matter to suggest the name of the mint itself. Under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and his immediate successors there are only isolated cases where special monograms or symbols are used to designate the mint of a certain issue.</p>
            <p>It is distinctly noticeable that only the semi-autonomous city-states of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName> were allowed thus to sign their respective coin-issues of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> type. We are therefore led to suppose that the use of special marks of origin show these coinages to be a municipal rather than an imperial undertaking. The remaining <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinages of this time were evidently struck under the jurisdic-
<pb n="19"/>
tion of imperially appointed officers in such provincial mints as were at the command of the central government (either of that particular province or satrapy, or of the empire as a whole). Therefore only the monograms and symbols of the responsible mint officials appear upon the coins.</p>
            <p>As stated above, by means of style we are indeed able to distinguish the issues of the larger geographical units. Where only one mint was in operation in a single province the name of this mint can then be determined with comparative ease, but where there were evidently two or more mints in operation at the same time, the problem immediately becomes more complicated and difficult of solution. Now the superintendents of a particular coinage, as we have seen, guaranteed their issues by placing the monogram of their name, or some personal symbol, in the field of the coin issued by them. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s empire, by its very nature, was such a cosmopolitan institution that little can therefore be gained by paying attention to the seeming local significance of any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of these sym-
<pb n="20"/>
bols. A Greek magistrate in some eastern mint might conceivably choose as his private mark the symbol of his native town — but this evidently furnishes us no clue whatsoever to the actual city in which his coin was really struck. Again, the symbols chosen are, as a rule, quite banal, such as thunderbolt, caduceus, amphora, club, etc., etc. These might have been used anywhere in the ancient world. In certain instances something may be gained by an intensive study of a whole series of such magistrates’ symbols appearing on coins which, by their style, must have come from one mint — but this is an uncertain clue to follow and usually leads to ambiguous results.</p>
            <p>In view of these difficulties and the true scope of the present articles on <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> hoards,<ref target="#Ch1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> we can only outline the reasons for assigning the various series to certain mints, or, failing this, to show briefly why no mint name can as yet be suggested. In other words, the discussion of attributions here must be looked upon as merely something in the nature of notes. The
<pb n="21"/>
present series of articles is primarily intended, as stated in the introduction, to place on record unpublished or otherwise important finds of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins, rather than to be a final treatment of the whole subject. These articles, in fact, are but the basis for such a treatment.</p>
            <p>In arranging the following list of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> coins the first column will be found to contain the serial numbers of the coins, while the second column gives us the number of specimens found of each particular variety. The third column is devoted to the symbol or monogram which distinguishes each variety, and the fourth column gives the reference to Muller’s <hi rend="italic">Les Monnaies d’Alexandre le Grand</hi>, <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, 1855. In this column a dash indicates the absence of that particular variety in <persName>Müller</persName>’s work, though the coin may have since been published by one of the many students in our field. In the cases of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_myriandrus">Myriandrus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> the writer’s own numbers have been substituted in the place of <persName>Müller</persName>’s, as for these mints the latter’s list has proved to be very in-
<pb n="22"/>
adequate. In the fifth column are found references to the plates. In the case of the present publication the plate numbers are in Roman capitals as I, II, etc., while the plate numbers in Arabic numerals refer to the writer’s previous study of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard. The sixth and last column contains the indications of the general condition of the coins of each variety as found in our hoard. For this purpose the following abbreviations have been adopted: W (worn) to denote coins that have seen a greater amount of circulation, though it must be remembered that none of the coins in the find were worn really smooth; VG (very good) to designate coins that are well preserved though they may have been in circulation for some time; F (fine) and VF (very fine) to denote coins that are practically uncirculated; B (brilliant) to designate coins apparently fresh from the mint with their surfaces still sharp and brilliant.</p>
            <p>On the whole the condition of the coins in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> deposit averages very high indeed. Not only had the majority of the coins seen comparatively little cir-
<pb n="23"/>
culation when their former owner consigned them to the earth, but since then the deleterious action of time and the salts in the ground have affected but few. There are indeed certain specimens from the find which are covered with a heavy agglomeration of thick purple oxide, as shown on Plate I, nos. 1-3. Many of these also had fragments of terra cotta embedded in the oxide. But the majority of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> coins had only a very thin coating of oxide, and that usually merely in spots, while the remainder still present their original appearance at the time they were buried nearly twenty-two and a half centuries ago.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing considerations it seems likely that the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> coins were once contained in several terra cotta jars. One of these had evidently, in the course of centuries, become very badly broken, thus allowing water and the various chemicals in the earth to attack its contents. Those coins which lay nearest the sides of the jar gradually became heavily coated with oxide, in one or two cases — as noted
<pb n="24"/>
by the writer — several coins coalescing into one conglomerate mass. To some of these, furthermore, fragments of the broken jar still continue to adhere. The coins which lay in the centre of the jar’s contents were apparently but slightly attacked. On the other hand, one or more of the companion jars must have remained absolutely intact throughout the centuries, in order to account for the exceptionally splendid condition in which such a large proportion of the coins still are to this day.</p>
            <p>Returning to our lists, it has already been stated that the entire material presented by the hoard is divided according to the provinces of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s empire. The issues of each mint have again been divided into groups and series, approximate dates being assigned to them wherever possible. As we are limiting ourselves, in the following pages, strictly to the coins actually contained in the find it will not always be possible to discuss the dates in detail — that will have to be deferred until a larger number of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> hoards will have been published and so made available to all.</p>
            <pb n="25"/>
            <p>As the types of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms remain constant throughout, it will not be necessary to describe each coin. In general, then, we find a young head of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> on the obverse turned to the right. In the rare cases where the head faces to the left special mention will be made of that fact. On the reverse the seated <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> invariably faces to the left. As a general rule <persName>Müller</persName>’s observation<ref target="#Ch1-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> still holds good, namely, that on the earlier issues the legs of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> are placed parallel to each other, on the later the right foot is drawn back and is to be seen behind the left. But this diversity of position had not ceased by the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s death, and the older type is often found continuing in certain mints until well into the third century B.C. The kingly title appears on a great many of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> coins and its presence is always specially noted in the catalogue.</p>

                  <p>Groups A to K, Nos. 1 to 1582 inclusive.</p>
                  <p>That the coins forming the above eleven groups belong together, and represent the issues of a single mint, has been demonstrated in the present writer’s “ Reattribution of Certain Tetradrachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName> ”.<ref target="#Ch1-n6">
                        <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                     </ref> As there pointed out, these coins all show one tradition of art and manufacture, and reveal a steady progression (one can hardly call it progress) in style. The individual members of each group are closely bound together, <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi>, by the frequent use of a common obverse die; the larger groups, in their turn, are also linked together in the same manner. In other words, group 'A’ will possess certain dies that were used in its production and then were continued in use, in a slightly more worn condition, for group ‘B’ Group ‘B’, in turn, will be found to possess cer-
<pb n="66"/>
tain obverse dies that had already been used for ‘A’, and others that were later used for ‘C’, and so forth. Since the publication of that study, a great many additional cases of such use in common of obverse dies between the component members of a single group, as well as between group and group, have turned up. These facts, taken together, prove beyond a doubt that these coins are all the issues of a single mint.</p>
                  <p>Little change has been made in the actual grouping of the varieties and their sequence. This can be more or less accurately determined by noticing the interchange of dies, the development of style and technique, and the average amount of circulation exhibited by the various groups contained in such a hoard as that of <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Reasons of style, the find spots of corresponding subsidiary denominations, the close connection with and continuation of the monetary issues of the previous reign, and the re-issue of posthumous silver with types of <persName>Philip II</persName>, all prove that the mint

which struck coins Nos. 1 to 1582 was situated within the boundaries of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>. At the time the monograph above mentioned was written, the choice lay between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> the capital and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> the largest port and the centre of the silver mining industries. The writer inclined towards <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> as the probable mint, but expressed the conviction that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>
                     <ref target="#Ch1-n7">
                        <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                     </ref> could present as good a claim. However, a continued and detailed study of the numerous later coinages of the same mint appear to prove conclusively that it was located in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> and not in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName>. At present it is not advisable to enter upon a necessarily lengthy discussion of the pros and cons, since this would demand the study of hundreds of coins not in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard and thus take us outside the limits originally set for this article.</p>
                  <p>The dates previously proposed for these Macedonian issues by the writer, in his “Reattribution of Certain Tetradrachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>,” must now be disregarded. At that time he followed the accepted authorities<ref target="#Ch1-n8">
                        <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                     </ref> in the interpretation
<pb n="68"/>
of the dates found on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> issues. Further studies,<ref target="#Ch1-n9">
                        <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                     </ref> however, revealed the indisputable fact that these dates are in error by some fourteen years, and this discovery throws out all previous calculations concerning the dates of the contemporaneous Macedonian issues.</p>
                  <p>The dates here assigned the various groups of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> coinage are, perhaps, to a certain extent approximate. But even so, they cannot be in error by much more than a year either way. The commencement of the coinage is determined by the accession of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, its termination — so far as our hoard is concerned—by the latest date<ref target="#Ch1-n10">
                        <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                     </ref> found on the accompanying issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>. Between these limits the material has been divided in such a way that, up to the two or three years immediately preceding the actual burial, the average annual production, in both quantity of coins and number of dies, is reasonably distributed. Naturally some years would witness a greater production than others, and full account has been taken of this possibility. The two final
<pb n="69"/>
groups were left out of consideration because of the apparently general law observable in coin hoards that, for perfectly natural reasons, the issues contemporary with the burial are usually comparatively scantily represented. That the working of this law should be noticeable in the present case is all the more likely, as our mint was situated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> and the hoard was buried in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. Also, certain material at the writer’s disposal would tend to show that groups J and K, and probably also I, were originally much larger than our find would seem to indicate. That the dates here assigned to groups A, B, C, and D are approximately correct is confirmed by the Kyparissia hoard recently published.<ref target="#Ch1-n11">
                        <hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                  <p>In looking over the issues of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> mint, as presented to us by the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard, we are naturally impressed by their quantity, continuity and evident importance as compared with the coinages of the remaining mints. In fact, they form at least one third of the entire hoard and outnumber the representatives of any other one mint. This is especially
<pb n="70"/>
to be noticed as the accumulation was no doubt largely made in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> where it was eventually buried. The number of dies used at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> also surpasses that found for any other place at this period. It will be recognized, therefore, that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> must have been the most important mint of the entire empire, not only during <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s lifetime, but also throughout the greater portion of his successor’s reign.</p>
                  <p>Before closing our notes on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> coinage, as represented in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard, it is necessary to correct an error which crept into the writer’s previous list of the varieties coming to him from that find. The tetradrachm illustrated on Plate 17, No. 3, is now known never to have been in the find. By mistake it had found its way into the lot purchased from <persName>M. Bourgey</persName> by the writer and so was included by him in his catalogue. It was not until too late that his suspicions, aroused by the divergent appearance of the piece and its anomalous presence in such an early hoard, were confirmed by <persName>M. Bourgey</persName>. The coin
<pb n="71"/>
had come to him at about the same time as the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> pieces, but from another source.</p>

                  <p>These coins must also constitute the issues of a single mint, as many of their types are connected by identical obverse dies.

                     </ref> It is obvious that the posthumous silver issues of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> type could only have been issued in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> and, possibly, Thessaly. The demand for this type of coin was apparently confined to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, and the northern barbarians. The last named seem to have especially favored this type of coin and it was no doubt largely for their special benefit that these posthumous issues were made. There must also have been a certain continued demand for them in Hellas itself, for the posthumous types are well represented in the Lamia hoard (preserved in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> collection) and in two small hoards from Central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> now in the writer’s possession.

                  <p>In comparing the issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> we see that the latter mint has by this time become of distinctly lesser importance than the former—which had not been the case under <persName>Philip II</persName>. At <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the issues themselves, the dies cut, and the actual coins struck, are comparatively few. This is also reflected in the fact that at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> only one annual magistrate, as a rule, supervises the coinage. At <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> it is evident that many magistrates must have functioned at one and the same time. Probably because of the contrast in their respective situations the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> mint now came to be used more for supplying local demands, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> mint for foreign commerce. It is a fact that while the writer has records of the latter’s issues being strongly represented in hoards from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">European Greece</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylonia">Babylonia</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> coins seldom turn up in finds made outside of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, and then only in small numbers. In the
<pb n="74"/>
European hoards, however, they are not uncommon. It is furthermore to be noted that such specimens of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> mint as did occur at <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> are all beautifully preserved, the majority hardly circulated at all. It is evident that they had not travelled much from hand to hand after leaving their dies. In contrast to this, considerable numbers of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> pieces, particularly of the earlier issues, must by their appearance have circulated a good deal before they were finally consigned to the ground.</p>

                  <p>If the coins of this type were not actually struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName>, they were at least copied from certain issues of that mint.

<pb n="75"/>
peculiarities, will not fit easily into the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> series as we know it, on the other hand they could not have been struck far away. Their late style, as well as the fact that all the known specimens from the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard were in fine condition makes it probable that they were issued about the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s death, or slightly later. It is quite possible that they were coined by <persName>Antipater</persName>, when in 322 B. C. he was shut up with his army in Lamia. The probable date of their appearance, their comparative crudeness of style and execution, and the fact that they imitated the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> issues, makes this suggestion at least worthy of consideration.</p>

                  <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Revue Numismatique</hi> for 1904, pp. 117-133, <persName>M. Babelon</persName> proposed the attribution of the first of the above types to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName>, because of the <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> he there makes between the youthful figure
<pb n="76"/>
with outstretched arms and the later, and better known, representation<ref target="#Ch1-n16">
                        <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                     </ref> of the youth holding a long fillet in his upraised hands. This figure <persName>M. Babelon</persName> calls “ Le devin de <persName>Sicyone</persName>".</p>
                  <p>At the time of his previous article on the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard, the writer was unaware of <persName>M. Babelon</persName>’s attribution of these particular coins to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName>, and saw in them only the issues of some uncertain mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thrace">Thrace</placeName>. Since then many new and unpublished types not in our hoard have come to light. They form a numismatic bridge between the earlier pieces with the “ Sicyonian divinity ” symbol and the later coins (<persName>Müller</persName>, Nos. 864893) undoubtedly struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName>. As it is here permissible to deal only with such varieties as actually occurred in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> deposit, a study of the extremely interesting <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName> as a whole will have to be deferred to some future time.</p>
                  <p>Among the most important and interesting of the coins that prove the correctness of <persName>M. Babelon</persName>’s attribution is No. 3.
<pb n="77"/>
Plate II. A close inspection will reveal that what at first seems only a flaw in the reverse die, immediately beneath the outstretched arms of the little figure in the field, is in reality a <hi rend="italic">flying dove</hi> somewhat minutely engraved. This definitely forms the link, hitherto missing, between the earliest and the later representations of the “ Sicyonian divinity ”, on the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinages. Thus we see the young god standing, with arms outstretched, both with and without the dove (Nos. 1 and 2, Plate 16), just as on the later <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName> he is standing holding a long fillet with his upraised hands. Here, too, the dove is sometimes present and sometimes absent. Certain autonomous bronze coins show him as on our coins of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> find, his arms stretched out in front of him as if to seize the bird, which, however, in this case too, is not always represented (see <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>, <hi rend="italic">l. c</hi>., p. 123, Nos. 11 and 12). Although not aware of the existence of a specimen like our No. 1649, <persName>M. Babelon</persName> yet describes the little figure on this type as in the act of stretching out
<pb n="78"/>
his arms “ <hi rend="italic">inspiré</hi> ” as he says, “ <hi rend="italic">par le désire de saisir la colombe</hi>, bien <hi rend="italic">que l'oiseau ne soit pas figuré. Il fait le geste de vouloir atteindre l'oiseau qui lui échappe et prend son vol.” (l. c</hi>., p. 124.) Now a specimen of this very type has come to light which actually depicts the escaping dove, and so proves <persName>M. Babelon</persName> quite right in his interesting surmise.</p>
                  <p>The somewhat surprising position of this dove —beneath instead of above the god’s arms where one might naturally expect to find the bird after which he is grasping — can perhaps best be explained as an artistic convention. Either the field of the coin was felt to be too limited to place the dove in front of the hands (the more natural position) or we have here to do with a direct copy of some well known statue embodying these peculiarities. In a statue, particularly one of marble, it would indeed be somewhat difficult to represent a bird flying unsupported in front of the outstretched hands of the god. It might, however, be represented as escaping from <hi rend="italic">between</hi> the arms, in which case these could
<pb n="79"/>
be made to support the flying bird. The coin engraver, seriously handicapped by the limited space at his command and the insuperable difficulties of a very small basrelief, would be forced to give us a representation of the statue as we see it on our coin. The result was evidently felt not to be a success and the dove appears on one die only.</p>
                  <p>The remaining types here assigned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName> were very poorly represented in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard and so, perhaps, do not clearly reveal their connection with the later coins correctly given to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName> by <persName>Müller</persName>. In fact, there are too many gaps here to make a lengthy discussion practical or even advisable on this occasion.</p>
                  <p>If the contents of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard thus give us a rather sketchy view of the sequence of the earlier <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName>, at least enough is available to prove that the Sicyonian mint must have enjoyed a certain amount of importance under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and his successor <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip III</persName>. During the campaigns in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</placeName> formed an important and
<pb n="80"/>
prolific recruiting ground for the armies. Many mercenaries were recruited from among the mountaineers of this rugged peninsula, no doubt lured into the service by the dazzling prospects held out to them of the fabulous riches of the East so easily falling into the hands of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s armies. The famous recruiting ground of Taenarum was, in fact, situated not so far away. An active mint, more conveniently located than those in distant <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, was certainly needed to supply the new recruits with the first installments of their pay and also to start them on their long voyage eastwards. It must furthermore be remembered that strong Macedonian forces were kept in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</placeName> during the war with the Spartan king <persName>Agis</persName>, and afterwards also, to discourage similar attempts at raising the standard of revolt in <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s rear among the ever rebellious <orgName type="ethnic">Greeks</orgName>. This consideration amply accounts for an active mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName>.</p>

                  <p>Nos. 1676 to 1747 inclusive.</p>
                  <p>The mints at which these coins were struck were probably no less than three in number. As shown by the great stylistic similarity of their issues, these particular mints must have been situated close to each other or were, at least, intimately bound together by ties of commerce.</p>
                  <p>It is not the writer’s intention to discuss their coinages here. The tetradrachms before us fail to give any adequate idea of the large series of coins issued by them. These series are almost entirely composed of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and posthumous <persName>Philip II</persName> staters, accompanied by unusually extensive issues of drachms bearing the names and types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander III</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip III</persName>. The coinage of tetradrachms was both scanty and intermittent. We would therefore be forced to transgress the bounds set for this article if we were to discuss the issues of these mints in an at all adequate manner.</p>
                  <pb n="82"/>
                  <p>Because of their style, the symbols employed, and the find-spots of single specimens of the accompanying drachms, Nos. 1676-1747 may in general be assigned to the regions bordering the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_propontis">Propontis</placeName>. This embraces both the <orgName type="ethnic">European</orgName> and <orgName type="ethnic">Asiatic</orgName> shores. Nos. 1687-1747 <persName>Müller</persName> has already given to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_perinthus">Perinthus</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thrace">Thrace</placeName>. Possibly he is correct in such an attribution, though the present writer would most certainly prefer to assign this large issue to the city of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> on the opposite shore.</p>
                  <p>Now there is no question but that to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the province of <placeName>Hellespontine</placeName> Phrygia constituted a vitally important portion of his empire, as through it ran the highway connecting him with his home base in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>. It must therefore have been very strongly garrisoned. Entirely aside from its strategic importance to the fast growing Macedonian Empire it was, and always had been, commercially most important and, therefore, very wealthy. Together with the Thracian Chersonese it commanded the famous waterway between the Aegæan and the Black
<pb n="83"/>
Sea. The lands around the latter were, and had long been, the granary of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, and so through the Hellespont ran the life lines of Hellas. This portion of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> had for centuries possessed mints noted for their large and continuous coinage. Under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the cities that still were allowed to retain their full autonomy continued to coin extensively, using their accustomed types. Among these were <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_salbace">Heraclea</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_calchedon">Chalcedon</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cius">Cius</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pergamum">Pergamum</placeName>, and many others.</p>
                  <p>The seat of the Persian government in these regions had been <placeName>Dascylium</placeName>, but we know of no Persian coinage having been struck there. Instead, the Persian satraps seem to have employed the convenient and already existing mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> whenever they had occasion to issue money of their own. It is to this fact that we owe not only the many Persian types found on the electrum staters of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> and the gold staters of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName>, but also the definitely and purely Persian coins evidently issued from time to time by these mints for satrapal pur-

                     </ref>. There can be no question but that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> were the most important coining centres in all this territory. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, however, continued to issue money in her own name and with her own types for some considerable time after the actual arrival of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>.<ref target="#Ch1-n18">
                        <hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                     </ref> We have therefore no reason to expect or to look for an <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage in that city—particularly as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> very jealously guarded her cherished autonomy throughout these stirring times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> seems to have fared differently. A study of her autonomous coinage reveals a great stylistic gap which cannot have commenced long after 335 B. C. and apparently extends to about 200 B. C. It is known that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> remained an important commercial centre throughout this period, and the apparent absence of any coinage is therefore highly significant. She had previously struck coins for Persian satraps, even going so far as to place some of their names (those of Orontes and Spithridates<ref target="#Ch1-n19">
                        <hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                     </ref>) upon them. There is every reason to believe,
<pb n="85"/>
therefore, that here would be located one of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s important mints. This follows not only from the fact of the city’s strategic and commercially important situation, but also from the fact that she had recently possessed a large and active mint and had actually coined for Persian satraps. In proceeding with our study of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s other eastern coinages we shall soon come to see how significant these particular points really are. It will be possible to show, again and again, that certain central mints especially active just previous to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s arrival were nearly always continued—for economy’s sake and because that very activity presupposes some definite commercial, political, or strategic importance—under the new régime. In other words, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> practically took over bodily the practices as well as the government and the provinces of the Persian Empire.</p>
                  <p>The series at present being discussed has therefore been assigned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> on purely external grounds. Internal evidences are not strongly conclusive, but,
<pb n="86"/>
such as they are, would seem to corroborate the attribution. The series, with its unusually extensive accompaniment of staters (<persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and posthumous <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> types) and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip III</persName> drachms, is by far the largest and most important in all north-western <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>. These gold issues are unusually prolific, as is only to be expected from a city which had been coining gold staters of her own in such abundance for so many years. One of the most frequently recurring symbols on the staters and drachms is the forepart of a winged horse, the peculiar emblem of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName>. Second only to this in frequency of occurrence is a figure of Artemis, one of the principal and most popular divinities of the city. As stated above, Nos. 1687-1747 had previously been assigned by <persName>Müller</persName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_perinthus">Perinthus</placeName> because of the curious double-horse symbol which occurs on the accompanying staters and is also found used as a type on the autonomous issues of that city. But these are evidently only magistrates’ symbols, and only one of them has any peculiar connection with Perin-
<pb n="87"/>
thus. We have to be on our guard against basing an attribution on the strength of a single magistrate’s symbol. Furthermore, the symbol of the joined foreparts of a horse is not exclusively Perinthian. The <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms described by <persName>Müller</persName> under his No. 393 were, by their style, certainly struck beyond the Taurus. Besides, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_perinthus">Perinthus</placeName> at this time was semi-autonomous and we have no reason to look for an <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage here at such an early period.</p>

                     </ref> occur of these posthumous issues of <persName>Philip II</persName> having been coined outside of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thrace">Thrace</placeName>, and the lands bordering the Hellespont.</p>
                  <p>The few specimens that have come down to us of the three types described above, apparently show that these coins were struck from adjusted dies. This point, too — the very first instance of this practice we have so far encountered — shows that we are moving away from the purely Greek issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_dium_macedon">Hellas</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, and north-western <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>. We are approaching the domains of the Persian Daric and Siglus. The use of fixed, or at least adjusted, dies had early become customary in the Orient. We may first notice the beginnings of the practice among some of the early electrum coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lydia">Lydia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ionia">Ionia</placeName>. The gold and silver issues of Croesus show an unmistakeable adoption of the adjusted die — that is to say, pre-
<pb n="89"/>
vious to striking, the obverse die and the reverse punch were carefully adjusted, if not permanently fixed, along a common axis. The real reason is not far to seek. The obverse design as adopted by <persName>Croesus</persName> consists of the foreparts of a lion and a bull placed vis-à-vis. This forms a composition whose general scheme is roughly □. Likewise the two reverse punch marks form a similarly oblong design. As the coin blanks used at this time were invariably oval in shape, it was consequently absolutely necessary — if all the design were to appear upon the coin — for the two dies to be placed in a similar position,</p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-003">

                  <p>their longest axes to correspond with the longest axis of the coin blank. For this reason we will always find the dies of the Croesic staters and <ref target="http://nomisma.org/id/siglos">sigli</ref> adjusted ↑ ← or ↑ → as in Fig. 1.</p>

                  <p>After the fall of the Lydian Empire the Persian kings substituted their darics and <ref target="http://nomisma.org/id/siglos">sigli</ref> for the Lydian coins, and the royal archer of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName> replaces the Lydian lion and bull. But now that the composition of the new type is roughly □, the reverse punch, being oblong in shape, must take an upright position because the oval coin blanks are still retained. Again the two dies necessarily assume positions to correspond with each other and the longer axis of the blank, as in Fig. 2. So long as

the Persian Empire lasted, the obverse die and the reverse punch mark on the royal coinage held the constant relation forced into this rigid position by the peculiar form of the blank. It is most probable, therefore, that in imitation of the royal issues the practice of adjusting dies, particularly in the most usual position ↑ ↑,

became so prevalent in the East at a comparatively early period — long before the mints of the Greek world adopted it.</p>
                  <p>As the coins described under Nos. 1748-1750 are so adjusted, it is reasonable to suppose that they originated in a mint under Persian influence. Their style, however, and that of the accompanying staters and drachms proves that they must have been struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, that is, north and west of the Taurus range. There is only one mint in this region that entirely conforms with the requirements demanded, and that one is <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName>. In the first place, there had for centuries been situated at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName> a royal mint, first under the Lydian monarchs until the death of <persName>Croesus</persName>, then under the Achæmenid<ref target="#Ch1-n21">
                        <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                     </ref> sovereigns. Under the latter, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName> constituted the seat of government for the very important First Satrapy while its governor was practically viceroy for the entire western portion of the Empire. It is highly probable that the darics and <ref target="http://nomisma.org/id/siglos">sigli</ref> coined here lasted until the coming of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. The latter, on his arrival, took over the city and, fol-
<pb n="92"/>
lowing the Persian precedent according to his almost invariable custom, retained <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName> as the capital of the Lydian Satrapy. Now in all this satrapy only <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName> is at all likely to have coined under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. It was the only large and important city of this district that did not possess complete autonomy. It had been a royal mint for centuries and had coined actively under the preceding régime. The remaining large commercial centres of the region, such as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ephesus">Ephesus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_clazomenae">Clazomenæ</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_erythrae">Erythræ</placeName>, etc., were autonomous Greek cities and enjoyed and jealously guarded the coveted privilege of striking autonomous coins. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> looked upon these Hellenic centres of trade and commerce as allies, and, like the Persian kings before him, refrained from infringing upon their rights of local coinage. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName>, however, was in a different category because as a city it had never enjoyed the rights of autonomous coinage, being the seat and royal capital of the satrapal government. Here <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> undoubtedly found an active mint of long standing, and furnished with all necessary

appliances and workmen. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName> we, for the first time, touch upon an outpost of oriental civilization and apparently find immediate evidence of this in the adjustment of coin dies.</p>
                  <p>As the coinages of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> and adjacent mints were intended to supply the needs of <placeName>Hellespontine</placeName> Phrygia and of the garrisons which were stationed there, so the coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName> was to supply the royal needs in the important satrapy of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lydia">Lydia</placeName>, and especially to provide the pay of the troops stationed here to protect the famous “ Royal Road ” which ran via <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName> to the East.</p>

gether can best be appreciated by studying the large number of gold staters that accompany them. Confining ourselves, however, to the tetradrachms we not only find a general similarity of style and technique between the various members of the group, but also several instances of a community of obverse dies. As the final issues (not represented in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> find) in both gold and silver of this large series are bound by style or by obverse dies to <persName>Müller</persName>’s Nos. 1033, 1054, 1055, etc., the attribution of the entire group to Miletus seems assured. Furthermore, the almost constant symbol appearing on the staters (<persName>Müller</persName>, Nos. 583, 584, 1131, 1134, 1135, 1137) and many of the later silver issues (<persName>Müller</persName>, Nos. 1133, 1136, 1138-1140) is the double ax, a symbol closely associated with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_caria">Caria</placeName>.

                  <p>These coins are members of one group and therefore the issues of one mint, as is definitely shown by the fact that all the varieties here given are bound together by the use of certain identical obverse dies. It is somewhat difficult, however, to assign the group to any one mint or even province. The style as exhibited, particularly by Nos. 1819 to 1943, is clearly that of Greek artists in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>. The reverses of Nos. 1944 to 1972 are evidently somewhat influenced by the contemporary issues of Tarsus (Nos. 2327-2369). But this does not mean necessarily that their mint must be looked for in <persName corresp="#nomisma_artaxias_iii">Cilicia</persName>. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s issues in Tarsus were discussed by the writer in a recent number of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi>.<ref target="#Ch1-n26">
                        <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                     </ref> There it was shown that because <placeName>Soli</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mallus">Mallus</placeName>, and
<pb n="97"/>
Issus had to have their municipal coins struck for them in the central mint of Tarsus, it was not at all likely that they possessed mints of their own during the lifetime of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, or even immediately after. The only other cities in <persName corresp="#nomisma_artaxias_iii">Cilicia</persName> that had coined extensively in Persian times were <placeName corresp="#nomisma_celenderis">Celenderis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nagidus">Nagidus</placeName>. If they coined under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, their issues could scarcely have been of such importance as those represented by Nos. 1819 to 1973 manifestly are. Furthermore, their issues, like those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>, would have been of a somewhat local character and so would have borne mintmarks of greater local significance.<ref target="#Ch1-n27">

                     </ref> Neither <placeName corresp="#nomisma_celenderis">Celenderis</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nagidus">Nagidus</placeName> can be looked upon as possible imperial mints.

                  <p>Nos. 1819-1973 are clearly royal issues as they bear no mintmarks of local significance, merely the private signatures of
<pb n="98"/>
magistrates in charge of the coinage. It is probable that their mint was located in some seaport or important commercial centre. This follows from the fact that specimens of these varieties are present in nearly every recorded <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> hoard buried previous to 300 B.C. They have occurred in at least six Egyptian hoards (including the present one), one Babylonian, one Syrian, one from Central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, four Greek, and one Macedonian. Single specimens have reached the writer at various times from nearly every quarter of the Near East, from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. Coins of this type were apparently very widely scattered in ancient times. This would lead one to suppose that they had originated in some active centre of commerce and trade, preferably a seaport. This is indeed negative reasoning and so is only of real value as a corroborative piece of evidence. On the whole, then, it might be said that the evidence points to some mint where “ royal ”, as in distinction to “ municipal ”, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins would be

struck, and this at some important seaport in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, not too far distant from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Approaching the problem from another angle, we have already noticed that the great Asiatic provinces of <placeName>Hellespontine</placeName>
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phrygia">Phrygia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lydia">Lydia</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_caria">Caria</placeName>, were severally supplied by an adequate coinage of the new types from their central mints. <persName corresp="#nomisma_artaxias_iii">Cilicia</persName>, too, was amply provided for, as the writer has tried to bring out in his recent monograph on the subject. In this portion of the world there remain only the three great provinces of Greater <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phrygia">Phrygia</placeName> (assigned to <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName>), <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lycia">Lycia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pisidia">Pisidia</placeName> (together with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pamphylia">Pamphylia</placeName> constituted as one province and assigned to <persName>Nearchus</persName>), and finally <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cappadocia">Cappadocia</placeName> (assigned to Sabactes as satrap). <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cappadocia">Cappadocia</placeName> is at once ruled out as it was somewhat out of the direct line of trade, was not as important a portion of the empire as the other provinces, and did not become a particularly active coining centre until much later times.</p>

Greater <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phrygia">Phrygia</placeName> and situated on the main road from <persName corresp="#nomisma_artaxias_iii">Cilicia</persName> and the East to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardis</placeName> and the West, might well lay a considerable claim to the possession of an important mint. By means of the commerce which undoubtedly flowed along this route, the die cutters of <placeName>Celaenae</placeName> would very likely be well acquainted with the coin issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName> and might soon be led to borrow certain details from them. However, <placeName>Celaenae</placeName>, so far as we know, never possessed a mint in Persian times. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> found it more expedient to issue his new coinage from old and well constituted mints, to which apparent rule there are only two exceptions, both of obvious explanation. The one is <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>, which was opened to take the place of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName> destroyed; the other was the mint in his new foundation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>, a city he planned as a great capital and so, obviously, in need of a suitable mint.</p>
                  <p>There only remains the important province formed from the united districts of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lycia">Lycia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pamphylia">Pamphylia</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pisidia">Pisidia</placeName>. Along the coast of this province were located the

busy seaports of Phaselis and Side, while further inland lay the powerful cities of Aspendus and Selge. All of these towns had struck coins in greater or lesser quantities before the coming of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s army. However, neither Selge nor Aspendus need be taken into consideration when searching for the possible mint of our tetradrachms. Selge was not of sufficient importance at this time, while Aspendus was attacked, severely punished, and suppressed<ref target="#Ch1-n28">

Both these cities were very closely bound by coasting trade with <persName corresp="#nomisma_artaxias_iii">Cilicia</persName>. They were active, wealthy, and well populated at the time of which we are speaking. The mountains behind them possessed rich silver mines, and Side’s mint, in particular, had long made full use of them. <persName>Nearchus</persName> apparently chose Phaselis as his seat of government,<ref target="#Ch1-n29">

                     </ref> and on this score that place could lay claim to an issue of coins such as ours. Side, on the other hand, was perhaps a more active centre of trade and commerce, and her issues of autono-

                  <p>The style of our pieces and the presence of the title point to a period after about 326 B. C. for their striking.

temporaneous groups of coins, the one distinguished by an ‘A’ beneath the throne, the other by a ‘B'. Special control marks are supplied by pellets, singly or in groups, placed beneath the throne or in the field behind the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> figure. A few of the obverse dies were used indiscriminately for both groups. There are also several instances where a reverse die of either series has been employed for the other, after the old letter had been erased and a new one substituted.</p>
                  <p>The second series is more uniform, and is distinguished throughout by a PLOW, perhaps symbolical of the far-famed fertility of the Tarsian plain. As special marks of control we find the pellets of the previous issue again used, and, in addition the letters, Β, Γ, Θ, and the symbols IVY LEAF and BUNCH OF GRAPES.</p>
                  <p>The distinguishing mark of the third issue is a wreath-bearing NIKE. She is accompanied by varying letters and monograms, and, towards the end, by a CADUCEUS. In the course of this series the old “Cilician” style, made so familiar to us

                  <p>The reasons for assigning these particular coins to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName> have already been discussed in “Some Cypriote Alexanders” <hi rend="italic">Num.

In discussing these coins on that occasion, the writer hesitated to see in the BOW a city mint mark, such as the other cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName> were using at this period. On reviewing this subject the possible suggestion has occurred to him that perhaps the BOW might rather be the personal symbol of <persName>Nicocreon</persName>, king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName> from 331-310 B.

The use of the king’s personal symbol on an <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issue, rather than a monogram or symbol designating the city itself, is paralleled on the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>.

place, the flying eagle (not dove), exactly as we see it on this coin, constantly appears on the autonomous coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amathus">Amathus</placeName>. On autonomous Paphian issues the dove is never depicted in the attitude of flight. In the second place, this coin is quite unlike the remaining <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paphus">Paphos</placeName>, while its reverse has many points in common with Nos. 2684-2714. This similarity is to be seen particularly in the details of the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> figure.</p>
                  <p>Nos. 2684-2714, distinguished by the symbol PROW, are typically eastern in style. The details of this style, however, point to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName> as the home of the mint which struck the coins. They will not satisfactorily fit in with the issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_artaxias_iii">Cilicia</persName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>, or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>—but partake of a little of the style of each. Furthermore, we have at our disposal no seaport town in any of these particular provinces which is either without a coinage already assigned to it, or which could have struck so large a series as the present issue apparently is. The fact that specimens occur in at least three out of the six hoards found in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>,
<pb n="110"/>
of which we have records, speaks well for a Cypriote origin. For between that island and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> the ties of commerce and trade were closely knit. Particularly would this be the case with the two harbors on the southern coast of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>— <placeName corresp="#nomisma_curium">Curium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amathus">Amathus</placeName>—to which no <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage has as yet been assigned. We know also that during the Persian period the mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amathus">Amathus</placeName> was very active and struck a large series of silver coins.<ref target="#Ch1-n36">
                        <hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                     </ref> It is most reasonable to suppose therefore, that like its sister cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amathus">Amathus</placeName> should have continued to strike money under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. There is no series of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms at our disposal whose origin is more likely to have been at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amathus">Amathus</placeName> than the group distinguished by the PROW symbol. We have also a tetradrachm (No. 2683) which bears the flying eagle peculiar to these autonomous issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amathus">Amathus</placeName>, and is therefore most likely to have been struck in that city. This piece forms the connecting link between the autonomous coinage and Nos. 2684-2714 with the PROW symbol.</p>

unlikely that our <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms were also struck by that king and signed with his symbol, the Caduceus. This would be paralleled by the use of the Bow on the Salaminian Alexanders of <persName>Nicocreon</persName>.</p>

the most important city in all northern <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>. Possessed of a splendid harbor, the roomiest and best protected on the coast, the city became the terminus of the great trade route, via the <placeName>Beilan</placeName> Pass, into the plains of inner <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>.

We may thus appreciate this north Syrian seaport at its true worth as the western terminus of the most frequented trade-route and military highway from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylonia">Babylonia</placeName> to the Mediterranean. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s farsighted statesmanship immediately recognized the vital importance of the spot.

                  <p>It is not surprising to find that the preceding Persian mint located in this important city continued its activity under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and issued a very large series of his coins.

                  <p>The proposed assignment of this coin (Plate VI, 2) is still open to doubt.

Details of the reverse, however, such as the position of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref>’ feet, coupled with the total absence of any footstool, resemble the issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>. Now the important seaport of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName> lay directly opposite to Came and was no doubt connected with it by ties of commerce. The next issue, No. 3268, is an almost exact copy of the contemporaneous coinage at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName> (Nos. 3334-3466) in the details of both obverse and reverse. These coins must surely have been struck at a town not far from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName>, or at least directly under the influence of its coinage.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the monogram <graphic url="NNM19_124.jpg"/> with which our coins are provided most easily resolves itself into KAP. It is to be noted that
<pb n="119"/>
the <hi rend="italic">alpha</hi> of the monogram does not possess the straight bar necessary for this letter at so early a date. The cross-bar is distinctly curved, which would thus almost certainly presuppose the presence of the letter <hi rend="italic">rho</hi> in the monogram.</p>
                  <p>Like the other cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName> at this time, then, it seems probable that Came commenced an issue of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms. Like them it was also allowed to mark its issues with a monogram of local significance.</p>
                  <p>Mint: <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">ARADUS</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Nos. 3269-3585.</p>
                  <p>Among the earliest <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName> must be placed a very rare coin, published<ref target="#Ch1-n40">

                     </ref> by <persName>M. Babelon</persName>, which apparently was not present in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> find. This is a tetradrachm bearing in the field of the reverse the Phoenician letters מא. This same inscription occurs on all the fourth century autonomous issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName>. Similar to this tetradrachm in style are our Nos. 3269-3285, but on these the Phoenician letters of the mint’s name
<pb n="120"/>
are replaced by the Greek letter ‘A’ beneath the throne. The Γ in the field is a magistrate’s letter. On the succeeding issues we find the magistrates signing their initials on the obverse (just behind the neck of the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Heracles</ref> head), while the ‘A’ has been elaborated into the monogram <graphic url="NNM19_126A.jpg"/> more distinctive of the Aradian mint. In passing, attention should be called to an interesting gold stater, first published by <persName>Gesenius</persName>

This stater embodies the peculiarities of two of the above tetradrachm issues. Behind the head of Athene we find the letter ‘Δ’ as on Nos. 3286-3288. On the reverse we not only find the monogram <graphic url="NNM19_126B.jpg"/> of those tetradrachms, but also the accustomed legend מא of the Aradian autonomous issues. Would that their mints had been so clearly indicated on all of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s coinages!</p>
                  <p>With No. 3302 the style of the Aradian issues changes perceptibly, the title ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΕ is added, but the mint mark <graphic url="NNM19_126C.jpg"/>

remains. The sequence of these particular issues was discussed more or less minutely in the <hi rend="italic">Amer. Jour, of Num.</hi>, vol. XLVI, 1912, pp. 42-44. We will therefore refrain from again going over the ground, and need only pause to reiterate, more strongly than ever, that the letters A, Δ, ι, Ι, Λ, and Σ found singly in the reverse fields, should not be considered as alphabetical dates.<ref target="#Ch1-n44">
                        <hi rend="sup">44</hi>
                     </ref> They are probably initials used by the various magistrates. The magistrate using the symbol CADUCEUS was the latest of the group, being in office just before the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip III</persName> was substituted for that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on the Aradian coinage. Apparently no specimens of these later issues, struck in the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName>, were present in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard.</p>
                  <p>None of the Aradian coins we have here described seem to have been struck from fixed or adjusted dies, a process so freely used at this time in the other Phoenician mints.</p>

                  <p>Nos. 3586-3652.</p>
                  <p>
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues corresponding to Nos. 3586-3652 have always, until now, been assigned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName>. In his previous article on the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard, the writer followed his predecessors, but stated<ref target="#Ch1-n45">
                        <hi rend="sup">45</hi>
                     </ref> that it was difficult to reconcile the style and appearance of these pieces with the issues (Nos. 3286-3585) which certainly belonged to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName>. It was therefore necessary to make the very improbable suggestion that these two series might both have been struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName>, but that perhaps the one was a local city issue, the other a military or regal issue. Very fortunately the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard is now known to have contained a tetradrachm, hitherto unpublished, which presents a solution to the problem. This is the remarkable piece, No. 3586, pictured on Plate VI, 3. The coin is of early date, and of Phoenician origin as shown by the two Phoenician characters עי beneath the throne. Its style and fabric is so close to the earliest
<pb n="123"/>
issues of Nos. 3587-3623 that it must be considered as the immediate precursor of those pieces and struck in the same mint. This means, however, that the entire group could not possibly have been struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName>. This conclusion is further substantiated by the fact that our coins are invariably struck from adjusted dies, and we have already seen that this is not the case with the issues certainly emanating from the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Nos. 3587-3623 are of modified ‘Cilician’ style, very similar, as a comparison will quickly show, to the earliest issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>. Now there is only one remaining mint in all this district which could possibly have struck such an important series as the one represented by Nos. 3586-3652. This is the ancient and flourishing city of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName>. It would have been surprising indeed if this city had not struck money in <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s name. History teaches us that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> made it his constant policy in the East to confirm in their rule such local princes as submitted to him without a struggle. Also
<pb n="124"/>
a study of his coins presents us with the undeniable fact that wherever such local dynasts had, under Persian rule, enjoyed the rights of coinage, these were reaffirmed to them by their new over-lord. Thus we possess <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName>, Citium, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paphus">Paphos</placeName>, Marium, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amathus">Amathus</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName> and Gaza form illuminating exceptions. Although they had enjoyed the rights of coinage under the Persians, they were deprived of this coveted privilege by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> because they had refused him submission.</p>
                  <p>If by a process of elimination we see that only <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> could have issued Nos. 3586-3652, we find a striking confirmation of this attribution in the presence on these coins of עי and <graphic url="NNM19_130.jpg"/>. The king ruling in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> at the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s invasion of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName> bore the name of Ainel, or, in Greek, Enylos as given by Arrian.<ref target="#Ch1-n46">

                     </ref> Of this ruler we possess tetrobols bearing local types. The weights of some of these pieces belong to the Attic system. As this is the very first occurrence of that system in the Byblite coinage, it is proba-
<pb n="125"/>
ble that these particular coins were struck after the submission of the city to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. The name of the king on these coins reads עינאלּ (Ainel). Now the first two letters of this inscription are exactly the two that appear beneath the throne on No. 3586 (Plate VI, 3). In other words, they prove that this tetradrachm was struck by Enylos. Again, following the local issues of Enylos, there exists<ref target="#Ch1-n47">
                        <hi rend="sup">47</hi>
                     </ref> another group of small denominations of local types and Attic weight bearing the name of the next ruler אדרמלך or Adramelek. Is it not at once apparent that, <graphic url="NNM19_131.jpg"/> the monogram on the subsequent tetradrachms (Nos. 3587-3652, Plate VI, 4) is but the ligature of the letters ΑΔΡΑ, the first portion of <persName>Adramelek</persName>’s name in Greek ?</p>
                  <p>The <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues now assigned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> are all struck from adjusted dies. In this they but follow the process used for the previous autonomous coinage of this city.</p>

                  <p>The assignment to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_berytus">Berytus</placeName> of No. 3653 is fairly certain. The six known varieties of this group all bear the letter B in the field and are closely allied by style with the coinages of both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>. In fact, the indications as furnished by style are so strong, that hardly any other attribution is possible.</p>
                  <p>As there are no really early issues known, it appears probable that a mint was not opened at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_berytus">Berytus</placeName> until after the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. At this time the chaotic conditions prevalent almost everywhere in the Empire favored the assumption by various cities of the right to strike money. That <placeName corresp="#nomisma_berytus">Berytus</placeName> had not yet grown equal in importance to her rivals on the north and south may be surmised from the comparative scarcity of her coinage.</p>

                  <p>As the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage of this mint has been studied in a special monograph,<ref target="#Ch1-n48">
                        <hi rend="sup">48</hi>
                     </ref> references to that work have been given rather than to <persName>Müller</persName> who was aware of but a portion of the known varieties. It will prove unnecessary to go into details here, as these the reader may find described and discussed in the above-mentioned work.</p>
                  <p>The Sidonian <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage was inaugurated almost immediately upon
<pb n="128"/>
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>’s arrival in that city. During the following two years the Phoenician letter צ, the initial of the city’s name צןד, is found in the field of the tetradrachms, while beneath the throne are the alphabetical dates א or ב. The series that follows omits dates entirely, substitutes the Greek letters Σ or ΣΙ of the city’s name, and on two varieties places a symbol in the field. In 327 B. C. the custom of dating the issues is re-introduced and the Phoenician date letters ז ה, ט, י, appear in the field. In the course of the year 323 B. C. Greek alphabetical dates are substituted for the Phoenician. In 320 B.C. the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> replaces that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
                  <p>The last date known to have occurred in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard is O, which corresponds to the year falling between the first of October 319 B. C. and the thirtieth of September 318 B. C. It is interesting and important to note that every known variety of the Sidonian <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachm, from the first opening of the mint down to the year O (319-318 B.C.) is represented in our hoard.</p>
                  <pb n="129"/>
                  <p>This would seem to be an opportune time to suggest a possible explanation for the curious absence of any apparent coinage during the year Λ (323-322 B. C.). Our lack of coins, either in gold or silver, for this year can hardly be due to chance. It would be strange indeed if the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard, so well provided with all the remaining Sidonian issues, should lack any examples of this particular date. The same is true of other large <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> hoards known to the writer who, furthermore, for the last fifteen years has carried on an active search for the missing date — but without success.</p>
                  <p>As long ago as 1909 <persName>Mr. Hill</persName> drew attention <ref target="#Ch1-n49">

                     </ref> to the absence of any coins dated Λ and suggested that <persName>Müller</persName> (or rather Mionnet, his source) might have misread Λ as A on his coin No. 1420. The coin has unfortunately since disappeared and we have no means of checking the reading. The coin, however, was placed by <persName>Müller</persName> among those of later style, Nos. 1415 to 1422, and these the present writer has elsewhere <ref target="#Ch1-n50">

                  <p>Either, then, we must suppose no coins whatever to have been struck in this year<ref target="#Ch1-n51">

                     </ref> is conspicuous for possessing more obverse and reverse dies than any other one year. With its six obverses and six reverses it is far above the average of some two or three dies (obverse or reverse) engraved and used yearly. The case of the silver issues for the tenth year is not quite so marked as that of the gold. For while, even here, we find that the י and Κ issues have two obverse dies and five reverse dies, this is a high but not an exceptional figure for the Sidonian coinage. The case of the gold, however, remains very striking.</p>
                  <p>Now the only alternative to the somewhat unlikely supposition that there really was no coinage in the year Λ is to suppose that י and Κ actually represent different years. But it is certain that י is ten. Then Κ must be the following year—and at once a simple explanation arises to the mind to account for the seeming anomaly. It must be remembered that the die engravers at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> were assuredly not <orgName type="ethnic">Greeks</orgName> but native Phoenicians.
<pb n="132"/>
They had used the Phoenician alphabet to designate the dates 1(א), 2(ב), 7(ז), 8(ח), 9(ט), 10(י). The next date would have been represented in their alphabet by ב, the eleventh letter. But if now, at the commencement of the new year, the order came in to replace the Phoenician alphabetical dates with Greek letters, what would have been the most natural thing for a Phoenician die cutter, thinking of the Greek alphabet in terms of his own, to have done ? Obviously, instead of engraving the next succeeding or eleventh Phoenician letter, namely, ב Kaph, it is very likely that unthinkingly he might have used <hi rend="italic">its actual Greek equivalent</hi>, namely Κ. Now Κ <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the eleventh letter in the Greek numerical (decadic) system, though here it stands for 20. In the alphabetical system, however, it is only ten, as digamma was omitted. Thus there were two stumbling blocks for the unwary Phoenician to trip over in making a hasty shift from his own alphabetical dates to the Greek. Probably it was brought to the attention of the local authorities even-
<pb n="133"/>
tually that Κ did not represent eleven in the Greek alphabetical numeration, as its equivalent Kaph does in the Phoenician. Perhaps, however, the mistake was not noticed until many coins bearing the offending Κ had already been issued, and so it was not deemed advisable, because of the resultant confusion, to strike new coins that year bearing the more correct Λ. So Κ was allowed to continue doing duty for Λ. But at the commencement of the new year, the twelfth after the coming of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>, the correct alphabetical designation of this year, namely Μ, was placed upon the coinage.</p>
                  <p>This would seem to offer a simple as well as a plausible explanation for the otherwise surprising fact of the apparent lack of any coinage in the year Λ. By assigning the Κ coins to the eleventh instead of to the tenth year, we also do away with the surprisingly large number of dies which we otherwise would have to give to the latter year.</p>

327-326 B. C., a system of dating according to the regnal years of the local dynast was introduced. This occurred in the twentieth year of that ruler. The latest date included in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard is his 29th year, corresponding to 319-318 B. C. (Plate VII, 2). Being dated, the two coinages of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> furnish us with the surest criterion for determining the true date at which our hoard was buried. Unfortunately, when first treating of the find,<ref target="#Ch1-n55">
                        <hi rend="sup">55</hi>
                     </ref> the material at the writer’s disposal was insufficient to appreciate these <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> dates in their true significance. Instead, the most reasonable one of the many views held by previous writers on the subject was adopted. The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> dates were referred to the era of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>, which took its inception with the Autumn of 333 B.C. This, however, caused the last <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> date, known to have occurred in the find, to be very much at variance with the evidence offered by the Sidonian dates from the same source. The facile explanation of this disturbing discrepancy lay in the fact that
<pb n="136"/>
the writer was well aware that at that time he had seen but a portion of the original hoard, and therefore many important varieties might have escaped him. The question was most interesting and important, and so special endeavors were made to secure all available material for the study of the dated issues of both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>. This resulted in the eventual publication by the Yale Press of a monograph entirely devoted to this one subject. Here it was possible to prove that the dates used on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>Alexanders cannot refer to any era of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Seleucus I</persName>, or such other eras as had been suggested by previous students. <hi rend="italic">The dates can only refer to the regnal years of some local dynast.</hi> They were first used in the twentieth year of his reign, which corresponds with 327-326 B.C. This changes the aspect of things entirely, brings the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> dates into complete concordance with those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard, and considerably alters the date previously suggested for the burial of that hoard.</p>

                        <hi rend="sup">56</hi>
                     </ref> of the author’s work on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Hill</persName> makes the suggestion that the dates found on the Alexandrine coinage of that city may be based on an era inaugurated at the end of the great Phoenician rebellion of 348 B. C. In other words, he hesitates to accept our dates as representing the regnal years of a local potentate. <persName>Mr. Hill</persName>’s suggestion is indeed plausible, and it is only after mature consideration that the writer still adheres to his former supposition. For between the end of the rebellion, with its supposititious granting of greater freedom to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>, and the arrival of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, some fifteen or sixteen years had elapsed. No coinage, autonomous or otherwise, had in the meanwhile appeared in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> to establish the custom of dating by that era. The importance of this era to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> must have been completely overshadowed in 333 B. C. by the cataclysmic arrival of the <orgName type="ethnic">Greeks</orgName> and the fundamental changes brought about by that event in all <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>. To the authorities in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>, in the year 327 B. C., the compara-
<pb n="138"/>
tively recent events of 333 B.C. must have appeared of far more importance and significance — at least so it seems reasonable to assume —than those of 348 B.C. We <hi rend="italic">know</hi> things were vastly altered in 333332 B.C., but we have absolutely no historical records to show that, as far as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> was concerned, there had been the granting of any special privilege of such importance that a new era should therefore be inaugurated. It seems much more probable to suppose merely that a new king had secured the power, or that a more loyal subject had been appointed by the Persian king as dynast in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Now there would be nothing so very extraordinary in a local ruler in 327326 B. C. adopting his regnal years as a means to date a purely local coinage of the Alexandrine type. At this very time a king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> places his monogram on his coinage, a little later <persName>Pumiathon</persName> of Citium places his name, regnal dates, and types upon his gold coinage, while <persName>Nicocles</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paphus">Paphos</placeName> engraves his name in full upon his Alexanders. For
<pb n="139"/>
these reasons the writer feels justified in retaining his theory of regnal years to explain the dates found on the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>.</p>

                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> — the greatest city of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> and the capital of empires from the days of <persName>Hammurabi</persName>, the law giver — had probably possessed a mint under the Persian kings. Continued by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> it became, next to the Macedonian mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, the most important in all his Empire. Here, until the removal of the mint to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_seleuceia_ad_tigrim">Seleucia</placeName> on the Tigris, were struck an extraordinary quantity of coins. Our ancient authorities make the
<pb n="141"/>
assertion that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> intended to continue this great metropolis as the capital and centre of his own empire, and it is reasonable to suppose therefore that a mint commensurate with this importance would soon be established here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> at this time was the central mart of the East. Hither ran the great overland trade route from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> via <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ecbatana">Ecbatana</placeName>. Here were also the wharfs for the ships which in their holds carried the goods of farthest <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> via the Coromandel Coast, through the Persian Gulf and so up to Babil or Bâb-ilî,. meaning “the Gate of the Gods,” in fact the “Sublime Porte” of the ancients. Hence the imported goods, as also those for which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> itself was famous, such as embroideries, rugs, and fabrics of various kinds, were taken up the Tigris or Euphrates and thence to shores of the Mediterranean or into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>. When the armies of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and the genius of their commander had made one empire from the Adriatic to the Indus, the importance of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName>, temporarily, increased

many fold. For now the markets of the West were thrown wide open, the freedom and safety of the trade routes by land and sea assured, the demand for eastern luxuries fostered and made possible of acquirement among the <orgName type="ethnic">Greeks</orgName> by the sudden influx of immense quantities of booty and treasure from the conquered cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName>. For all this traffic <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> remained the focus of the land and sea routes until about 300 B.C. By that time <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> had grown into an important city, and, because of the skilful policy of <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> and the constant internecine wars of the Diadochi, which made land travel especially unsafe and intermittent, had deflected a large part of this traffic by way of the Red Sea to herself. But throughout the last quarter of the fourth century B. C., <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> flourished exceedingly. During this time quantities of coin were apparently issued by her very active mint.</p>
                  <p>The <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard contained a large and representative series of the Babylonian tetradrachm issues covering the first

                        <hi rend="sup">59</hi>

gin. It is interesting to note that the type with the rose as symbol possessed more specimens in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> find than any other one type (all together 134 pieces, or 138 if we add the slight variant Nos. 4610-4614). Originally there may have been many more than this number, as was the case with another of the Egyptian types. In his letter <persName>M. Dattari</persName> stated to the writer that there were over a hundred specimens in the find of the ‘Khnum’ (Nos. 4748–4780) type, although the writer actually saw only 33 specimens of this beautiful coin.</p>
                  <p>An interesting point brought out by a study of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard is the fact that no mint was apparently opened by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> until at a comparatively late date. This was suggested by <persName>M. Svoronos</persName> in his work on the Ptolemaic coinage, but is now definitely confirmed by our hoard. From the evidence of the dated coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName>, the hoard cannot have been buried <hi rend="italic">before</hi> 318 B. C. Now there are only five distinct varieties of the tetradrachm in our hoard
<pb n="146"/>
that can be assigned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>; and of these, two — those with the Ear of Barley (VII, 3) and the Pegasus symbols (VIII, 1)—represent very small issues.<ref target="#Ch1-n60">
                        <hi rend="sup">60</hi>
                     </ref> The style exhibited by these coins is so similar throughout that their issue could not have covered a very long period of time. If we assign the opening of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName> mint, then, to in and around the year 326-325 B. C., we shall probably not be far wrong. These <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>n issues were first used as a model for the Sidonian coinage in the year which ran from October 1, 325, to September 30, 324 B. C.</p>
                  <p>It is still somewhat uncertain whether our hoard contained any specimens of the next series of Egyptian <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms, those, namely, with the portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> himself, clothed in the elephant’s skin head-dress, on the obverse (<persName>Svoronos</persName>, Nos. 18-24,93). These must have followed closely upon the series described above, as the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> figure of the reverse is identical in style and details with that found on our coins. One
<pb n="147"/>
variety, moreover (<persName>Svoronos</persName>, No. 93), has the same symbol and monogram as our Nos. 4822-4826. <persName>M. Dattari</persName> was of the opinion that the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard contained ten of these pieces. Although <persName>M. Dattari</persName> is in all probability absolutely right, they have not been included in our study, as the writer has throughout been careful to limit himself only to the pieces he has actually seen and handled.</p>

                  <p>Little further can be added to the notes on punchmarks and “graffiti,” as discussed by the writer in his previous study of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard. Only four varieties of punchmarks have been noted on coins from this hoard. The first consists of a pellet in the centre of a sunken circle, with six rays running out from the pellet to the circle’s edge, the whole resembling a wheel. This punchmark was found on only one coin in the hoard, Plate VIII, No. 2. The second type occurs somewhat more frequently. Usually indistinct and poorly struck up, it seems
<pb n="148"/>
to represent a human eye. Three specimens (coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName>) are given on Plate VIII, 3-5. The third punchmark appears just once, on a coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>, here Plate VIII, No. 6. It consists apparently of the three Phoenician letters, צמי, in an oblong depression. The fourth punchmark consists of a small circle containing a raised pellet. The pellet is joined to the circle at top and bottom by narrow necks or bands. This type of punchmark occurred twice in our hoard, once on a coin of type 2334-2338 and once on a coin of type 3300-3301.</p>

                  <p>The distortion of view, which might be expected to have been shown by a hoard of widely struck coins buried in a province lying as much to one side as is the case with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, is hardly noticeable. The issues of only one or two mints have suffered, the remainder are represented in direct proportion to the size and importance of their tetradrachm issues.

The only distortions noticeable are indeed slight. One or two varieties of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</placeName> mint seem to be missing, while the early tetradrachms of northern and western <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> are not very strongly represented. Judgments as to the true size of the various mintages are based by the writer on his carefully kept records of the number of obverse and reverse dies known for the

various mints. To illustrate, a brief table is here appended showing the number of dies used at some of the most important mints for the period covered by the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard.

                  <p>To determine the approximate burial date of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard is not difficult — now that the dated coinages of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> are better understood. Of these Sidonian issues every year is represented from א through י, and the succeeding Greek dates from Κ to Ο inclusive. The tetradrachm bearing the last-named date must have been coined between October 1st of 319 and September 30 of 318 B. C. Similarly, every <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> date is represented from the first use of dates on its coins in the 20th year of the local dynast’s reign down to and including his 29th year. The writer has elsewhere<ref target="#Ch1-n63">
                        <hi rend="sup">63</hi>
                     </ref> shown that these dates are to be reckoned from the year 348-347 B.C., which brings the year 29 to 319-318 B. C. Thus both series exactly agree in placing the probable burial of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard at a date not earlier than the commencement of 318 B. C. On the other hand, the hoard could not have been buried much after the commencement of 317 at the latest. The dated coin series of both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and
<pb n="153"/>
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> were continued uninterruptedly for many years after this date. The fact that their issues are frequently met with in Egyptian finds speaks volumes for a constant and close commercial relationship between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName> at this very time. Therefore the sudden stoppage in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard of the Sidonian coinage at the year Ο, and of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ace_ptolemais">Ake</placeName> coinage at the corresponding year 29 — while the preceding coinages without a single exception are well represented in the find — is highly significant.</p>
                  <p>That the burial of our hoard took place in 318 B. C., or at most soon after the commencement of 317 B. C., is fully corroborated by other though somewhat less definite clues which the contents of our hoard offers. For instance, the coins issued in the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip Arrhidaeus</persName> (323-317 B.C.) are well though not completely represented. To be noted is the fact that it is always the latest of his issues, or his coinages in distant mints, that invariably are missing. Thus for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> we lack any specimens dated Π
<pb n="154"/>
(Oct. 4, 318-Sept 30, 317 B. C.). We also miss the common varieties listed by <persName>Müller</persName> under Nos. 1, 20, 54-56, 84-85, 92, 100, 108, 111, 113-115, 117, 120, 125, 129, etc. Clear-cut cases are those of the Persian mint (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_ecbatana">Ecbatana</placeName>?) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName>. The former first commenced to coin towards the end of the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip Arrhidaeus</persName>, but none of its very common issues are to be found in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> find. The <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> issues of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> mint, in the order of their appearance, are represented by <persName>Müller</persName>’s Nos. 99, 104, 103, 24, 26, 29, and 117. Of these the first five are well represented in our hoard, though in ever diminishing numbers. No. 29 is represented by but one specimen in mint state, while the exceedingly common variety No. 117 is conspicuous by its complete absence. The final <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> issues of other near-by mints, such as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aradus">Aradus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</placeName>, are also noticeably absent. Thus it can be seen that we would not be far wrong in adopting the year 318 B. C. as the probable burial date of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Reasons for the Burial</hi>.</head>
                  <p>The entire lack of any reliable information concerning the find spot of our hoard, or its mode of burial, leaves the field wide open for numberless conjectures respecting its former owner and his immediate reasons for burying so great a treasure. To allow our fancy to stray among so many fascinating possibilities would serve no useful end. Arguments could be adduced with equal plausibility to prove our hoard a government treasure, a military war chest, the accumulation of a wealthy merchant, or even robbers’ loot hidden away in a moment of danger.</p>
                  <p>The facts are that the hoard was interred just at the moment when the land of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, so far as we know, was enjoying profound peace. The great convention of the Satraps at Triparadeisus in 321 B.C. had confirmed <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy I</persName>n his possession of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. The following year he had, in a somewhat high-handed fashion, seized upon <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>. The other Satraps were at that time far too absorbed in their own troubles to do more
<pb n="156"/>
than protest. The ensuing years were spent by <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> in quietly organizing his kingdom and strengthening his power for the conflict he knew lay ahead. To be sure, in the year 318 B.C. — that is, the very year which apparently witnessed the interment of our hoard — a considerable flurry was occasioned in the eastern Mediterranean by the sudden descent of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philetaerus">Eumenes</persName> upon <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>. Here he seized certain large maritime cities, and upon their docks and wharves commenced to construct a fleet with the intention of securing command of the sea. Although <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> was thus temporarily forced out of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName>, we have no reason to suppose that his possession of Palestine was threatened or that <persName corresp="#nomisma_philetaerus">Eumenes</persName> contemplated any immediate descent upon <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. Certain it is that <persName corresp="#nomisma_philetaerus">Eumenes</persName>’ power in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phoenicia">Phoenicia</placeName> collapsed as quickly as it had arisen and that before the summer’s end he had retreated eastwards into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>We may be hardly justified, therefore, in associating the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> burial with
<pb n="157"/>
so distant and ephemeral a danger. The times, however, were obviously uncertain and dark clouds loomed on the political horizon. The original possessor of our hoard may have decided against taking any chance with so large a treasure, and hence proceeded to bury it before it might be too late. On the other hand, we have absolutely no historical or archaeological data to suggest any local disturbance occurring at this time. The fact remains that the great Hoard of <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> still guards its secret as absolutely as did its ancient owner after he consigned his treasure to the ground two thousand two hundred and forty years ago.</p>

               <p>Within the last three years <persName>M. Dattari</persName> has informed me of a find of 3000 <persName>Alexander</persName> tetradrachms, and not long afterwards of a hoard of 46,000 Roman coins. These seem to be but average occurrences.</p>
