            <head>FOREWORD</head>
            <p>Even at this late date, it sometimes seems that the value of numismatic evidence for art-historical studies is something more often acknowledged
               than exploited; nonetheless, each year finds more thorough use being made of numismatic material by scholars in that field, while numismatists
               themselves are more apt than formerly to see that the findings of the art historians can be of use to them in their own studies. The writer knows
               of no other single problem, however, in which the two disciplines are more closely interrelated, and in which the solution involves such a degree
               of interpretation of material from each field in terms of the other, than the one under examination here. For accepting for publication in this
               series a study of this sort, which sometimes ranges far afield from the normal concerns of purely numismatic research, the writer is deeply
               appreciative of the consideration given by the Publication Committee of the American Numismatic Society.</p>
            <p>The problem which forms the focal point of the present study was first set forth in relevant terms over two decades ago by Professor <persName>André Grabar</persName> of the Collége de France; the writer owes a great debt to Professor <persName>Grabar</persName> for
               guidance through his writings, his teaching, and his counsel during the course of the preparation of this study. Some of its conclusions were
               presented in a preliminary way in Professor <persName>Grabar's</persName> seminar at the école des Hautes études in 1951, while a more final
               but still more summary account was given at the Symposium on the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> Seventh Century held at <placeName>Dumbarton Oaks</placeName> in 1957.</p>
            <p>This study was prepared originally in the form of a doctoral dissertation, under the direction first of Professor <persName>A. M.
                  Friend, Jr.</persName>, and then of Professor <persName>Kurt Weitzmann</persName>, to whose generous help and assistance its completion is
               largely owed. Professor <persName>Ernst Kitzinger</persName> has taken a kind interest in the findings, with the result that the present
               paper is undoubtedly far sounder than it would otherwise have been; Professors <persName>Paul A. Underwood</persName> and <persName>Glanville Downey</persName> have given of their knowledge and critical advice, as have <persName>Messrs. Cyril A. Mango</persName>, <pb n="x"/>
               <persName>Basil Laourdas</persName> and <persName>Ihor Ševčenko</persName> in various ways. In bringing this manuscript into form for
               publication, the advice, suggestions and corrections of Professor <persName corresp="#viaf_34584084">Alfred R. Bellinger</persName> have
               been invaluable.</p>
            <p>Numismatic experts and curators have been most helpful in extending the facilities of their institutions and making available their funds of
               knowledge; the writer must acknowledge particular indebtedness to <persName>Dr. George C. Miles</persName> and <persName>Mrs. A. A.
                  Boyce</persName>, and to <persName>M. Jean Lafaurie</persName> of the Cabinet des Médailles, Bibliothéque Nationale. Study in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> would have been far more arduous without the cherished facilities of the Institut Byzantin
               and the skilled assistance of its staff, under <persName>M. Boris Ermolov</persName>.</p>
            <p>Such specific acknowledgements can only partially indicate the full indebtedness of the writer to the many friends and scholars, all of whom have
               had a part in the pursuit of this problem; an attempt is made to recognize specific contributions at relevant points in the footnotes. Any
               scholarly work is a mosaic of contributions from many sources, written and verbal, published and suggested, all of which go to make up the final
               synthesis; but, as in the creation of a mosaic picture, the responsibility for the final result is not with the contributors of the individual
               tesserae, but with the person who puts them together in the hope of forming a coherent whole. For the faults and errors which may exist in the
               text which follows, the writer must accept sole responsibility.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> was the first <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> emperor to place the
               image of <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> on his regular official coinage.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> When he
               took this step, furthermore, he used not one but two quite different representations of the physical appearance of Christ. The precedent thus
               created was ignored by his successors, however, and the Christ-image disappeared again from the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coinage for a
               century and a half, while the Eastern Empire was torn by the Iconoclastic Controversy; then, almost immediately upon the Restoration of the
               Images in the middle of the ninth century, one of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> two coin types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> was copied almost line for line by the die-cutters of <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName>, and thereafter became the prototype of one of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> representations which became normal on imperial <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coins from
               the ninth century on.</p>
            <p>These facts have long been well known, and the importance of <pb n="2"/>
               <persName>Justinian II's</persName> innovation is generally recognized; but it has been more difficult to ascertain the meaning placed in
               his action at the time it was taken. In recent years, increased attention has been given <persName>Justinian II's</persName> issues by a
               group of scholars whose special concern is the theory of icon-worship developed by the iconophiles of the eighth and ninth centuries.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> While the interest shown by these iconophiles in <persName>Justinian II's</persName> use of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> image is of great importance to an understanding of the fully developed image
               theory, much less is known about the actual background, political, theological, or whatever it may have been, of <persName>Justinian
                  II's</persName> own actions; in other words, whereas the ninth century's evaluation of seventh-century practice is important in understanding
               eighth- and ninth-century attitudes toward images in general, it is considerably more difficult to apply this same eighth- or ninth-century
               evaluation to the seventh century itself.</p>
            <p>This is not to say that our understanding of what was developing with regard to attitudes and practices of religious art in the seventh century
               has not advanced markedly in recent years, not least as a result of the above-mentioned researches.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> Until now,
               however, no <pb n="3"/> attempt has been made to study the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> in a
               thorough way from the numismatic standpoint, with a view to applying our new knowledge of their own and later periods, and their possible
               relation to pre-Iconoclastic image-theory.</p>
            <p>The pre-Iconoclastic age was a pivotal one, not only for the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> Empire, but for all of what we know as Europe.
               The very scarcity of the material from which we must reconstruct a picture of the epoch serves to show us just how critical its position was. We
               are well enough informed about the era of <persName>Justinian the Great</persName>, a period in the course of which we may perceive the
               beginnings of the evolution of the <placeName>Roman</placeName> Empire into its mediaeval form. But we are far less <hi rend="italic">au
                  courant</hi> with events in each subsequent decade. With the coming of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>, and
               the first of a new series of battles with the resurgent Orient, a veil begins to fall over the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> Empire,
               through which we can dimly discern men and events, but little of the institutions and ideas that gave them life. When, in another hundred years,
               the <placeName>Isaurian</placeName> emperors had succeeded in beating off the Moslem onslaught, the curtain begins to lift. The stage is the
               same, but all else, characters, scenery, dialogue, the whole frame of reference has changed immeasurably.</p>
            <p>Clearly all this did not happen overnight, in the eighth century. A great deal of research has been devoted to the study of these new
               institutions which we see in operation under the <placeName>Isaurians</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> and all of it has served to
               illustrate how much of the modification of the structure of the Empire took place in the century before <persName corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo III</persName>, the years between the great <placeName>Persian</placeName> invasion of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> around 613, and the final unsuccessful Moslem attack on <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> in 717
               A. D. The new administrative system of the themes, integrating civil and military administration; the new agrarian laws, adjusting conceptions of
               property <pb n="4"/> and ownership to the new realities of a ravaged countryside; these and many other details, large and small, of <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> life can be demonstrated, or may be hypothesized, to have had their origins in the century which followed the
               advent of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>.</p>
            <p>The final stage of this transition, it is clear from our evidence, was taking place under the last ruler of the <persName>Heraclian
                  Dynasty</persName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>. His two reigns, interrupted and followed as they were
               by periods of anarchy which prepared the way for the new strong man, <persName>Leo</persName> the <placeName>Isaurian</placeName>,
               provided despite their difficulties the last period before the Iconoclasm when the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> government enjoyed
               sufficient stability to concern itself not only with civil administration and policy, but also with religious practices.</p>
            <p>In the matter of the art of the period, we find a situation directly parallel to that just described with regard to its political history. The
                  <placeName>Isaurians</placeName> brought with them a new attitude toward the Christian religion and its art, an attitude which we call
               Iconoclasm. They left an indelible imprint upon the character of <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> art, religious and secular. Yet the very
               nature of the Iconoclastic movement erased a great deal of the evidence which would tell us what came before it, and consequently whence the
               Iconoclastic attitude itself derived.</p>
            <p>Just as recent research has pushed the origins of the <placeName>Isaurian</placeName> legislative system back a century, so we can see now
               that Iconoclasm itself did not spring like a weed from untilled soil. Rather is it true that the conflict had been preparing itself for decades
               in the minds of men, within and without the boundaries of the Empire; and what happened to religious art, in its theory and in its practice, in
               the course of the seventh century, was of the greatest importance in determining the rise of the opposite viewpoint, Iconoclasm.</p>
            <p>The evolution of religious art in this period just prior to the Iconoclasm has a further interest, inasmuch as it formed the basis for the
               concepts used by the Orthodox party against the Image-Breakers, and supplied the concrete examples necessary for the formulation of regular
               Orthodox icon-theory; not only that, but surviving examples, and memories, of this art evidently provided the point of departure for the new
               religious art which flowered almost immediately upon the Restoration of the Images, in the ninth century.</p>
            <p>The problem posed for the art historian by this period immediately before the advent of the <placeName>Isaurian</placeName> Dynasty, as may be
               seen from the <pb n="5"/> foregoing, is that of ascertaining in the first place what monuments survive from that period, and secondly what those
               monuments can tell us about the character and tendencies of the arts of that time. It is, thus, a problem of extremely broad scope, considered
               from the point of view of geographical distribution alone. This was perhaps the last moment at which we may consider the art of the Mediterranean
               basin to have presented a fundamental, though naturally not homogeneous, whole; in all the lands of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName>
               Empire, whether or not its political rule was still felt, its artistic hegemony was evident. The questions raised about the character of this art
               can only be answered satisfactorily when all the arts of the period, toward the close of the seventh century, have been studied and compared in
               detail.</p>
            <p>History has played us the trick, at just this point, of erasing the center of the disc of the Empire, leaving us only fragments of its rim. At
               all times, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> was unquestionably the most active center of the creative
               arts of the Eastern Empire; its influence could not but have been felt in all the peripheral areas with which it was in contact. Only through
               appreciating the importance of this essential unity can we explain the changes and evolutions of such provincial art as has been preserved,
               changes which are rarely the result of independent progress, but rather show every sign of being dependent upon the dynamic central source.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>There are certain of the provincial areas where we may, in time, be able to assemble sufficient data to clarify this aspect of the problem. In
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, and particularly in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, the
               Popes were frequently active in the fields of construction and decoration, as the tattered palimpsest of <persName>S. Maria
                  Antiqua</persName> bears witness; one of the most active Popes in this respect was <persName corresp="#Q956579">John VII</persName>, and the
               art produced during his brief reign, contemporary with that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, should
               provide valuable evidence, if only by inference, of what influences were reaching <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>
               from the East at that time.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, and especially at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonika</placeName>, there would appear to have been a good deal of activity in the arts, but here problems of attribution and Hating present
               greater difficulties in drawing precise parallels for purposes of comparison. The same is true of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, in the present state of our knowledge, for although it is generally agreed that Coptic art remains subject to recurrent waves
               of influence from the Empire long after <placeName>Egypt's</placeName> conquest by the Moslems, the lack of an established chronology, within
               even a century for the most part, makes analysis and comparison extremely difficult. Yet it is probable that the only way in which these problems
               of Coptic chronology will one day be solved is by just such correlations between Coptic monuments and established and dated works outside <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, our documents tell us enough about relations between the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> emperors and the <placeName>Umayyad
                  caliphs</placeName>, as well as between their subjects at more humble levels, for us to be fully aware of the dependence of <placeName>Umayyad</placeName> art in its more formative stages upon the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> traditions which it supplemented. The happy
               discoveries made in the Near East in recent years, as well as the generally resurgent position of Islamic studies, give great hope that our
               knowledge of <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> as well as <placeName>Sassanian</placeName> art will be vastly increased as more Islamic
               material becomes available.<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of any one study, at the present stage of our knowledge, could however scarcely embrace with profit all these scattered fields of
               artistic production. In view of the nature of the central problems of pre-Iconoclastic religious art, the most pressing need is to establish what
               can be known about the art actually produced in the imperial circle itself; and in the period which concerns us, the surviving <pb n="7"/>
               imperial art, with negligible exceptions, is exclusively that of the coinage. It is for this reason that the following study is undertaken on a
               numismatic basis; its objective is the establishment of the following facts about the emperor's coinage:</p>
            <q>First, what numismatic issues were struck under his reign, in what sequence, and at what dates;</q>
            <q>Second, what meaning or meanings these coins were intended to convey, and hence</q>
            <q>Third, what the reasons may have been for issuing them.</q>
            <p>It should be possible, in the light of this information, to clarify some of the attitudes held by official, that is to say, by state and
               ecclesiastical circles, concerning religious images, and particularly their use in the state cult. From this, it is to be hoped that something
               may be deduced about the wider context of the religious art of the time, about the spirit which manifests itself through both style and content
               as an expression of the outlook of the age. From this material, it may be hoped that future research will have one more tool with which to attack
               some of the major problems of the history of <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> art.</p>
            <p>As a first step in this exposition, it is necessary to provide a brief historical survey of the principal events of <persName>Justinian
                  II's</persName> reign, insofar as they may be seen to have a bearing upon his numismatic activities.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> The reign of
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, whose full name was <persName>Flavius</persName>
               <pb n="8"/>
               <persName>Justinianus</persName>, began upon the death of his father <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine
                  IV</persName>, sometime during the summer of 685 A. D.; he was then sixteen years old.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> The Empire was at that time
               in sounder condition than had been the case for some decades; <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</persName> had
               beaten off the first high-watermark assault of the Moslem power in the protracted siege of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> between 673 and 677, and reasserted the strength of the Orthodox faith at the Sixth Oecumenical Council, held at the
               capital in 680–681. This Council condemned the Monothe-lete heresy which, while accepting the two Persons of <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName>, preached only one will or operation in the personality of <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName>; this heresy had been warmly espoused by the preceding emperor, <persName>Constans
                  II</persName>, and accepted by one <placeName>Roman Pope</placeName>, <placeName>Honorius</placeName>, whom the Council therefore condemned
               as a heretic. Of <persName>Constantine IV's</persName> various actions to strengthen the Empire, the only one which was less than a
               resounding success was his campaign of 679 against the <persName>Bulgars</persName>, who had <pb n="9"/> recently invaded the <placeName corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</placeName>, and whom he was unable to dislodge from their new strongholds.</p>
            <p>The first actions of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> new reign were designed to continue this procedure of strengthening the position of
               the Empire, both internally and in relation to allies and. enemies abroad. To make plain his adherence to the tenets of strict Orthodoxy, he held
               a synod in the Great Palace to confirm the Acts of the Sixth Council.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> In 688 <pb n="10"/> he conducted a major
               campaign against the <persName>Bulgars</persName> and <persName>Slavs</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, where he succeeded in relieving their pressure on the native populations. Finally, about the same time, he concluded a new
               treaty with the Moslems, on even more favorable terms than those secured by his father after the rout of 677;<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> his
               troops had been on the offensive along the southern borders, a fact which may have influenced the Moslems to buy a firmer peace, and his ablest
               general, <persName>Leontius</persName>, seized full control of <placeName>Armenia</placeName> and the rest of the <placeName>sub-Caucasus</placeName>, which lad shown signs of slipping into the Moslem orbit.</p>
            <p>In 692, however, this string of successes was broken when the Moslems, accusing the <placeName>Byzantines</placeName> of violating the terms
               of the treaty, invaded the province of the <placeName>First Armenia</placeName>, and defeated <persName>Justinian II's</persName> army at
               the battle of <placeName>Sebastopolis</placeName>. Whatever the ostensible cause of the Moslem attack,<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> its
               result was clear: <placeName>Armenia</placeName> surrendered to Moslem authority, and the Empire lost valuable prestige throughout the
               borderlands.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, however, the emperor continued to concern himself with domestic affairs as well. He held a church council on a more ambitious
               scale than the synod of 686, in the same Trullan Hall of the Great Palace where the Sixth Council itself had met; since neither that nor the
               preceding Fifth Council of 553 had dealt with matters of church and lay discipline, this new council of <persName>Justinian II's</persName>,
               meeting in 692,<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> was intended to be simply a continuation of the proceedings <pb n="11"/> of 681, concerning itself
               solely with bringing up to date this aspect of church affairs. It came to be known, therefore, as the Quinisexte Council. It issued one hundred
               and two canons dealing with all matters, lay and clerical, in which the authority of the Church needed to be applied or restated.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These acts were drawn up, unfortunately, by a council of clergy drawn exclusively from Eastern dioceses, so that whenever a question of
               preference between the practices observed in the Eastern churches and those of other communions, such as the Armenian or the <placeName>Roman</placeName>, arose, the natural decision was in favor of the familiar one.</p>
            <p>This may not have been of major importance with regard to the feelings of the Armenians—although it was the Patriarch of <placeName>Armenia</placeName>, <placeName>Sabbatius</placeName>, who surrendered his land to the Moslems the following year, and offense taken with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> over these matters might conceivably have influenced his decision—but
               when it came to offending <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, really serious matters were at stake. The principal points of
               difference on the theoretical level were the recognition of 85 Apostolic Canons, of which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>
               acknowledged only 50, and the assertion of the equality of the bishops of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> with those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, an equality to which seniority of establishment
               did not entitle them. In matters of practice, the Council prohibited fasting on Saturdays, a <placeName>Roman</placeName> custom; it permitted
               the lower orders of the clergy to remain married, if already in that condition, a practice disapproved at least on principle by the Holy See; the
               command to abstain from 'blood and from the meat of strangled animals infringed upon certain Western customs; and finally, a decree that <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> should be represented <pb n="12"/> in human form, rather than as a Lamb, condemned
               one of the more common themes of symbolic early Christian imagery which had been quite popular in the West.</p>
            <p>It would seem almost certain that the framers of these canons were not aware of the extent of their offense in the eyes of <persName>Rome</persName>;<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> the tone of the Acts conveys the impression that the Eastern bishops felt merely that their
               Western colleagues, in those troubled years, were in need of guidance on a few points where unfortunate political circumstances, such as
               barbarian invasions, had compelled temporary abandonment of the truly correct procedure.</p>
            <p>Whatever the intentions and motivations of the framers of the canons may have been, the fact remains that the Acts of the Council were completed
               and duly signed by the emperor, as well as by the patriarchs of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</placeName>, and
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName>, and by two hundred eleven other bishops and representatives of bishops;
               then they were forwarded to <persName>Rome</persName>. There, <persName>Pope Sergius</persName>, recognizing what he felt was an
               affront to his dignity as well as an abrogation of his powers and status, not only refused to sign the Acts, but forbade their publication in any
               church under his jurisdiction. The ensuing dispute dragged on for months, with action delayed by the long time required for communications to
               pass from East to West and back again; at length the emperor resorted to the expedient, successfully carried out by <persName>Constans
                  II</persName> in 653, of kidnapping the <persName>Pope</persName>. On this occasion, the effort ended in a low-comedy debacle for the
               imperial agents, and the papal hand was strengthened rather than otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> had no further chance for reprisal against the <persName>Pope</persName>, for in 695 the emperor was overthrown by a coup led by his erstwhile general, Leontius.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> The
               unpopularity engendered by <persName>Justinian's</persName> defeats at the hands of both the Caliphate and the Papacy had not been mitigated
               at home, where brutal ministers carried out a policy designed, perhaps, to weaken the traditional power of the nobility; <pb n="13"/> so the
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> mob flocked to the standard of revolt, and jeered in the <placeName>Hippodrome</placeName> while <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> was disfigured with slit nose and
               tongue, in token of deposition, and then exiled to <placeName>Cherson</placeName> in the <placeName>Crimea</placeName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Leontius</persName> ruled only three years, until 698, and the only major event of his reign was the military campaign which
               resulted in his downfall. The continuing expansion of Moslem territory led to the fall of <placeName>Carthage</placeName> in 697, and <persName>Leontius</persName> dispatched a powerful naval and military force to attempt its recapture. Although this expedition had some
               initial success, and even reoccupied the city, the Moslems in turn obtained reinforcements, frightened off the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> fleet, and permanently took the city of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</placeName> in 698.</p>
            <p>The unsuccessful armada, aware of its disgrace, decided its only hope of avoiding punishment was to rebel against its emperor; the rebels named
               one of their admirals, <persName>Apsimar</persName>, new emperor under the name <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius_iii">Tiberius
                  III</persName>, and sailed for <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>. There they met with greater success than at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</placeName>; <persName>Leontius</persName> was deposed, mutilated like <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, and exiled to a monastery. <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius_iii">Tiberius
                  III</persName> proved not an incapable monarch; under his rule the Empire was able at least to hold its own against the expanding Moslem
               power.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, in the <placeName>Crimea</placeName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> had been forced
               to flee from <placeName>Cherson</placeName> when the authorities there discovered that he was plotting to recover his throne. He took refuge
               with the <persName>Khagan</persName> of the <placeName>Khazars</placeName>, one of the most powerful of the <persName>Hunnish
                  tribes</persName> of the steppes, and married the <persName>Khagan's</persName> sister-<persName>german</persName>, whom he named <persName>Theodora</persName>. <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius_iii">Tiberius III</persName>, informed of these events, bribed the
                  <persName>Khagan</persName> to murder or surrender <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>; forewarned by
               his loyal wife, <persName>Justinian</persName> escaped a second time, gathered a boatload of supporters at <placeName>Cherson</placeName>, and set sail across the Black Sea.</p>
            <p>It was now the autumn of 704; the little party wintered at the mouth of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</placeName>, after
               experiencing violent storms at sea, and there they contacted the <persName>Bulgars</persName>, who were only too happy to contribute an army
               to <persName>Justinian II's</persName> campaign to win back his throne. It was not until the summer of 705, however, that this barbarian
               host descended upon the walls of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> The
               inhabitants of the <pb n="14"/> city met them with jeers and catcalls, and might have stayed safe within their mountainous ramparts, had not
                  <persName>Justinian</persName> been able to slip through a small gap or postern near the <placeName>Blachernae</placeName> gate,
               occupy the <placeName>Blachernae</placeName> palace, and rally his own supporters. The fickle populace deserted <persName>Tiberius
                  Apsimar</persName> at this moment, and <persName>Justinian</persName> was able to resume his throne without having had to resort to the
               dangerous expedient of allowing the <persName>Bulgar</persName> army inside the walls of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>.</p>
            <p>A great triumph was celebrated in the <placeName>Hippodrome</placeName>, to which both <persName>Tiberius Apsimar</persName> and the
               deposed <persName>Leontius</persName> were dragged. <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, seated in the
                  <placeName>Kathisma</placeName>, presided over the races with one foot on the neck of each of his prostrate foes, while the mob chanted,
               'Thou hast trodden on the asp and the basilisk; the lion and the dragon thou hast trampled under foot,"<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> playing on
               the names of <persName>Apsimar</persName> and <persName>Leontius</persName>. When the races were over, <persName>Justinian</persName> sent them both to the <placeName>Kynegion</placeName> to be beheaded. His vengeance fell also on the Patriarch <persName>Callinicus</persName>, who had consecrated the usurpers; he was blinded, and sent to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> as a living witness of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> return to power. Havoc was wrought in the army and the civil
               service, as all who had supported the usurpers were executed.</p>
            <p>While all this went on, the emperor dispatched an armada to <placeName>Khazaria</placeName>, to bring back his wife <persName>Theodora</persName>. This fleet came to grief in another of the autumn storms for which the Black Sea is famous; when he learned of it, the <persName>Khagan</persName> sent a message to his brother-in-law: 'Fool, should you not have sent two or three ships to fetch your wife, and
               not have killed so many men? Did you expect to have to seize her by force?<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> Learn that a son is born to you; send
               and get them both." When at last the mother and child were safely brought <pb n="15"/> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>, <persName>Justinian</persName> crowned them both, and ruled jointly with his infant son, who was named <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName> in further imitation of the practices of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName>, the Great.</p>
            <p>The year 705 saw significant changes in the leadership of the other world centers, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</placeName>
               and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, as well. <persName>Abd el-Malik</persName> died, after a twenty-five year reign
               of exceptional brilliance, to be succeeded by his son <persName>Walid</persName>, a far more fervent partisan of Arabisation. In the same
               year, one of the ablest of the 'Greek" Popes, <persName corresp="#Q956579">John VII</persName>, was elected to the See of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. It was with this <persName>Pope</persName> that <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> resumed negotiations over the Acts of the Quinisexte Council, with a view to obtaining the needed papal signature. The
               blinded Patriarch <persName>Callinicus</persName> was undoubtedly an effective messenger; but he was followed also by two metropolitan
               bishops bearing those six tomes which <persName>Pope Sergius</persName> had refused to sign thirteen years earlier. Yet the emperor seems to
               have been far less overbearing this time, as the fact that his emissaries were bishops, not soldiers as before, would indicate. The terms in
               which <persName>Justinian</persName> couched his demands were conciliatory in the extreme. He urged the elderly pontiff to convene a synod
               to which the Acts might be communicated; this synod should then confirm those canons which seemed worthy of approval, and reject those which were
               unsatisfactory. Instead, <persName>John</persName> returned the Acts unemended to the emperor, saying that he could find no fault with any
               of them—yet he still neglected to sign! Thus, when he died shortly afterward, the whole business had to be taken up all over again with his
               successor, <persName>Constantine</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By this time, his purges completed, <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> had a falling out with his erstwhile
               ally, the <persName>Khan</persName> of the <persName>Bulgars</persName>, and in 708 he led an expedition far up the Black Sea coast to
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_anchialus">Anchialus</placeName>. His army was ambushed and routed, and the survivors returned to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> in full flight. The following year the Moslems, on the move once more, besieged the important trading
               center of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyana">Tyana</placeName>, well north of the <placeName>Taurus range</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>; a relief expedition was slaughtered, and the city fell to the Arabs. From this
               time on, Moslem raids on <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> territory became bolder and bolder; small parties of marauders rode right up to the
               Bosphorus, looting and burning as they went.</p>
            <pb n="16"/>
            <p>Moslem pressure increased, in preparation for the full-scale invasion which was to follow only eight years later.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 711, <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> received the ceremonial visit of the reigning <persName>Pope</persName>,
                  <persName>Constantine</persName>, who was honored with great reverence by the emperor and his son, as our <placeName>Roman</placeName>
               sources relate. The disputed canons of the Quinisexte Council were again discussed, and presumably agreed upon—but the fact remains that we have
               no surviving copy of the Acts of 692 signed by any <persName>Roman Pope</persName>.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had the papal party returned home, when they learned that the prince with whom they had so recently conferred was dead, and the little
                  <persName>Augustus Tiberius</persName> who had met them on the road to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>, butchered at the very
               altar of the Church of the Virgin at <persName>Blachernae</persName>. <persName>Justinian's</persName> unremitting vengefulness had
               begotten further violence. The object had been his home of exile, <placeName>Cherson</placeName>. Three ill-advised expeditions to the <placeName>Crimea</placeName>, designed, according to our sources,<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> to punish the <placeName>Cherson</placeName>ites for their attempt to betray him to <persName>Tiberius Apsimar</persName>, furnished instead a rebel armada to overthrow
                  <persName>Justinian</persName> himself. In effect, it was the same story as in 698: the imperial forces, prevented from accomplishing
               their mission by the interference of the <persName>Khazars</persName>, found themselves obliged to revolt against their ruler as the only
               possible way of saving themselves from punishment for their failure.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Justinian</persName>, when he feared, but could not be certain, that his last expedition had come to grief, committed the tactical
               error of leaving <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> with his field army, to scout in the direction of <placeName>Pontus</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> In this way, the rebel fleet was able to seize the capital in his absence. His troops were subverted, and <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> fell easily into the rebels' hands, for instant execution.</p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>The chief of the rebels, the Armenian Philippicus <persName>Bardanes</persName>, assumed the purple, and proclaimed the Monothelete faith
               reinstated; <persName>Pope</persName>
               <persName>Constantine</persName>, hearing of this, took great alarm, but his fears were soon quieted. <persName>Bardanes</persName>.
               reign was short, and Monotheletism died with him. The succession of petty rulers who followed to the throne served only to set the scene for the
               assumption of power by <persName corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo III</persName>, the great <placeName>Isaurian</placeName>, in March of
               717 A. D., when the Moslems were again about to lay siege to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>, for the second time in forty years; but
               that is another history.</p>

                  issue intended for general circulation. The figure of <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> had appeared on <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coins already, however, to judge by the unique solidus of <persName>Marcian</persName> and <persName>Pulcheria</persName> in the Hunterian Collection, illustrated by <persName corresp="#viaf_100184717">George

                  armor, three-quarters facing, has for reverse type the figures of emperor and empress standing, with <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> behind and between them, placing a hand on each of their shoulders. The reverse legend is
                  "FELICITER NUBTIIS."</p>
               <p>The significance of the type has been elucidated, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit</hi>., along the following lines: Whereas <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> on this coin assumes the place taken in <placeName>Roman</placeName> iconography by <persName>Juno Pronuba</persName>, He specifically replaces the figure of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius
                     II</persName> as seen on a coin celebrating the marriage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_valentinian_iii">Valentinian III</persName> and <persName>Eudoxia</persName> in 437 <persName>A. D. Christ</persName> appears on the later coin (dated ca. 450) because the marriage
                  was one of form only, the bride having taken irrevocable vows of chastity at an early age; she married only to continue the imperial
                  succession. <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> as depicted on this coin, insofar as can be determined given its
                  worn condition, has the rounded skull, long face, beard, and cross-nimbus familiar in fifth-century Italian art of other media.</p>
               <p>In any event, this coin, which must have been struck in very limited quantity, had no immediate influence on <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coin-types, or on the imperial Christian iconography: <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName>
                  appears here for a specific symbolic reason, and not because of any function He performs in a more generalized way for the Christian religion,
                  or for the Christianized imperial cult.</p>

                  furnish an absolutely reliable narrative and chronology of events. It has been necessary to reexamine all the sources, and to make a few new

                  regarding the date of the later Quinisexte Council (cf. below, n. 14), and compounded by <persName>Theophanes'</persName> losing sight of
                  the distinction between this Synod and that Council. The Synod is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Lib</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Pont</hi>. I,

                  at the head of one text of the Acts of the Sixth Council, the one which it had conveyed.<lb/> It has been suggested by <persName>F.
                     Gérres</persName>, "<persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> und das rémische Papsttum," <hi rend="italic">BZ</hi> XVII, 1908, pp. 432–54, that <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> was abrogating the rights due
                  the papal and patriarchal authority to publish the acts of an oecumenical council; thus this was the first move in a concerted caesaropapistic
                  campaign by the young emperor to bring the See of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> under the complete sway of his own
                  authority. This seems rather an overstatement of the situation on several counts, the most important being the lack of evidence that at this
                  period such publication <hi rend="italic">was</hi> considered the particular prerogative of the ecclesiastical authorities; to the contrary,
                  the initiative in each of the great church councils was taken by the reigning emperor, from <persName>Constantine I</persName> on, and he
                  was never in any case considered to be infringing upon clerical rights by these actions. The emperor held <hi rend="italic">ex-officio</hi>,
                  in fact, the rank of deacon in the church hierarchy. In the same way, it was customary for the emperor to take the responsibility for
                  circulating the completed acts of the councils. Although <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> shortly found reason to object
                  to certain of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> actions, there is no indication that his promulgation of the texts of the Sixth
                  Oecumenical Council was in any way disapproved.<lb/> The explanation for holding the Synod seems to be more simple. There is an indication
                  that the volume of the Acts of the Sixth Council which was the property of the imperial palace had strayed from its place in the palace
                  archives, and was found in the offices of the chancellery. (<persName>Cf. Mansi</persName>, <hi rend="italic">op</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cit</hi>. XII, cols. 189–96). When the volume was located and returned, it was deemed desirable that new copies, checked in every way for
                  authenticity and accuracy, should be prepared—perhaps because, as the emperor intimates in his <hi rend="italic">sacra</hi>, some falsified
                  versions had been circulated (presumably by recalcitrant Monotheletes) while the original volume was missing from its rightful place.<lb/>
                  Some misapprehension may have arisen, furthermore, because, early in 686, the ex-patriarch <persName>Theodore</persName>, who had been
                  deposed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</persName> in 679 (on the eve of the Sixth Council) for his
                  Monothelete views, had recanted and been restored to the See of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>. Although <persName>Theodore</persName> behaved himself with utter circumspection during this second term of office, it might well have seemed desirable to take
                  this dramatic way of demonstrating his adherence to full Orthodox tenets, as well as that of his emperor.</p>

               <p>The dating of the Quinisexte Council has occasioned more difficulty than was necessary, largely because of the various conflicting methods of

                  confusion in <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q319403">Theophanes</persName> under A. M. 6177 (cited above, n. 11), where the chronicler had
                  read correctly the date improperly preserved in the Acts of the Council (<persName>Mansi</persName>, <hi rend="italic">cp. cit</hi>. XI,
                  cols. 921–1006), but failed to place it in the proper era; so <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q319403">Theophanes</persName> arrived at a
                  date of 706 A. D. for the Council. He knew that this must be wrong, since the Council had taken place during <persName>Justinian's</persName> first reign; so he placed his account of the Council at the very beginning of that reign, taking advantage of the
                  opportunity to confuse the Council with the Synod of 686, and to summarize the latter part of the Monothelete Controversy. The Quinisexte
                  Council took place, as <persName>Leclercq</persName> shows, during <persName>Indictio V</persName>, that is, after September first

            <head>THE COINS OF <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>
            </head>
            <p>The usefulness of numismatic evidence for the art historian will vary widely from period to period, and from country to country. By way of
               generalization, the following statement may be considered valid for <placeName>Roman</placeName> imperial coins and their successors, the
                  <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> issues, in virtually all periods: These coins represent a significant field of the imperial iconography,
               never entirely neglected by the authorities for their ability to bring messages to the general public, or to special segments thereof; the
               coinage tends to reflect, then, significant changes of imperial policy as they may be susceptible of representation in the imperial iconography,
               and in any case, are more reliable guides to iconography than to stylistic character. The imperial coinage, moreover, partook of some of the
               sacred character enjoyed by official portraits of the emperor.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> Thus the coinage inevitably represents the intentions
               of the imperial authority, to a degree perhaps varying according to the distance of the issuing mint from the seat of that authority, and the
               actual power there exercised. When, as in the case of the issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, a
               radical change was made in the nature of the types represented, we can safely assume that a significant shift in imperial policy itself had taken
               place.</p>
            <p>Our first necessity, then, will be to describe the types of coins issued by this emperor. For our descriptions, we base our work both on the
               pertinent sections of the general catalogues of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coinage,<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref>
               <pb n="19"/> and on the relatively few specialized works on this immediate set of issues.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>When we examine the coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, as that of any other of the emperors of
               his period, we find that the principal determining <pb n="20"/> types are to be found in the gold issues, and most specifically among the solidi;
               not only the fractional gold, but the coins in silver and bronze, form relatively simple sub-types to the solidi (although in the West a certain
               amount of greater liberty in creating variant types was exercised), with the normal differentiations demanded by the established criteria of
               denominational indications. For the purposes of our study, then, only the types of the solidi need be described; nor do we need to delineate the
               precise epigraphy of the legends, or the various officina-marks represented among the known specimens. For this and for other details, the
               catalogues cited above provide information, pending publication of a corpus. <persName>Laffranchi's</persName> essay, just cited, includes
               an able study of the epigraphy of the coin legends of these and adjoining reigns.</p>

            <p>The basic identification of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> mints is fairly well established, but it was <persName>Laffranchi</persName>'s achievement to arrive at a new and more satisfactory analysis of the mints of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> for the period leading up to the accession of <persName corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo
                  III</persName>, on the basis of more complete information (provenance, local collections, etc.) than had been available to his predecessors. At
               variance with <persName>Wroth</persName>, then, <persName>Laffranchi</persName> distinguished four mints in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>: at <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>, at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>,
               somewhere in <placeName>South Italy</placeName>, and in Sicily. The Sicilian mint of this period can be proven by certain mint-marks to have
               been located at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>; that in <placeName>South Italy</placeName>, which was in close
               touch with the mint of the Lombard dukes of Beneventum, may have been located at Naples.<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Ricotti Prina's</persName> more recent study of the Sicilian coinage has supplemented but not altered <persName>Laffranchi</persName>'s findings about the series and sequences of imperial coins of this period;<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> but he has also
               been able to distinguish a series of coins of a particular type as the product of a mint established on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>, probably at <placeName>Cagliari</placeName>, in the territory of the <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q246737">Exarchate of Africa</orgName>.<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> The first issues of this new mint, which have a
               fabric similar to the thick Carthaginian one, appeared during <persName>Justinian II's</persName> first reign, when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</placeName> was already threatened by Arab raids and attacks (<ref target="#fig-13">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> 1, 11</ref>).</p>
            <p>Integrating these additions to the previous arrangements of the mints, we find that we can obtain the following picture of the numismatic <pb n="26"/> activity of the two reigns of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, according to the known gold
                  coins:<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref>

            <p>
               <placeName>SYRACUSE</placeName>: Type I.</p>
            <p>The scheme of arrangement which we have followed in numbering and presenting the coin issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> is, with a few exceptions in detail, the conventional order used in previous numismatic
               studies, based on a few self-evident facts. It may be well, at this point in our study, to indicate that, on the other hand, this arrangement is
               essentially an arbitrary one. These are the points on which it is based:</p>
            <p>Type I–A is clearly the earliest struck, both because its types are derived directly from previous numismatic issues, and because it portrays the
               emperor in beardless boyhood. Type I, for the same reasons, follows immediately after.</p>
            <p>Types IV and IV–B, on the other hand, are plainly late—they must date from the second reign, when <persName>Justinian's</persName> infant
               son <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName> had been named Augustus.<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> On the other hand,
               they would appear to have been issued more or less simultaneously, Type IV at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, IV–B elsewhere in the West, with the bronze equivalent of
               IV–B serving at the capital. This leaves only Types II and III to be placed in their relative chronological positions; we may do that by virtue
               of the similarity of Types III and IV which, although not requiring the assumption of an absolute chronological precedence of Type II over Type
               III, makes it clear that the morphology of these types did tend in the direction II–III–IV rather than III–II–IV.</p>
            <p>Another observation points to the same conclusion: we have already remarked that on Types II, III and IV, it is <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> who occupies <pb n="27"/> the obverses of the coins, while the emperor is on the reverses.<ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> This is something quite unprecedented in the imperial numismatic iconography, for which there is no parallel in
               earlier issues of either Christian or pagan emperors; the obverse, the side of greatest honor, had always been reserved for the imperial image of
               highest rank. This resignation of the obverse by the emperor to <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> is most clearly
               seen, however, on Type II, where the inclusion of the mint-mark seals confirmation of the change of position. The design of Types III and IV make
               it more difficult to include a mint-mark and, in fact, the mint-mark is dropped entirely on these coins. (The question arises as to which
               consideration came first: was the mint-mark omitted because the design left no place for it, or was a design chosen which left no room for the
               mint-mark?)</p>
            <p>In any case, the fact that the emperor or emperors still occupy the reverse on Types III and IV can be determined by comparing the fractional
               gold, on which the base of the cross potent held by the rulers changes to follow the coin's denomination. This, however, is an indication seen
               most clearly only when a variety of gold pieces is at hand, not when the coins are examined one at a time; hence a less obvious one. On
               post-Iconoclastic coins, too, where the image of <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> became a common type, there is
               even less of an obvious indication of whether the emperor or the <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName>-image occupies
               the obverse; but when the scyphate series begins, it is to be seen that <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName> always
               occupies the anvil die, which more or less by definition is considered that of the obverse.<ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>San Quintino's</persName> monograph, which seems to have escaped the notice of the cataloguers listed in n. 2 above, has been
                  largely superseded by their work, since they had at their disposal considerably greater quantities of specimens from which to form their
                  conclusions. It does have at least an academic interest, however, in its valiant attempt to survey the problems of the bronze coinage of the
                  period. The author gathered a large number of pieces, for the most part of Italian provenance, and although many must now be reattributed, his
                  plates repay careful study, as has been shown by the work of <persName>Ricotti Prina</persName> mentioned below.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Bellinger's</persName> article is not in the nature of a catalogue, but gives a clear idea of the qualitative as well as the
                  stylistic distinction with which the coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> must be credited. The
                  same author has returned to a related area of study in a more recent article, 'Coins and <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> Imperial Policy,"

                  V, 1939, pp. 7–15, 91–2. Reprinted as a complete essay, <placeName>Perugia</placeName>, 1940. <persName>Laffranchi</persName>,
                  although not a specialist in the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> field, was able by the application of techniques of stylistic,
                  iconographic, orthographic and paleographic methodology to make a set of convincing new attributions of mints for the Italian coinage of this
                  period; most important of all, he succeeded in identifying for the first time the coins of <persName>Leontius</persName>, in a series
                  previously attributed to <persName corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo III</persName>, by means of a monogram on certain Western bronzes,
                  which monogram, including an unmistakable 'T", must pertain to <persName>Leontius</persName>, rather than to <persName>Leo</persName> (identified on his coins simply as 'Leon.")</p>
               <p>(More recently, a simple explanation has been found for the identification of <persName>Leontius</persName> on most of his coins as
                     '<persName>Leo</persName>," in the fact that the latter was the imperial name he assumed at his coronation, the former his original
                  given name. Just so <persName>Apsimar</persName> became the emperor <placeName>Tiberius</placeName>, <placeName>Bardanes
                     Philippicus</placeName>, and so on. The similarity of the parts of the double name, '<persName>Leo Leontius</persName>," was probably what
                  led the chroniclers to overlook his official name, and retain his former one, to the long-standing confusion of struggling numismatists: <persName>J. P. C. Kent</persName>, 'The Mystery of <persName>Leontius II</persName>," <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</hi> VI:
                  14, 1954. pp. 217–8.)</p>
               <p>Finally, there is the important study by <persName>Diego Ricotti Prina</persName>, 'La monetazione siciliana nell'epoca bizantina," <hi rend="italic">Numismatica</hi> XVI, 1950, pp. 26–60 &amp; PI. I–IV, which further clarifies the situation as regards Sicilian mints of this
                  period, as well as some related problems, as we shall indicate in our notes below.</p>

                  by <persName>Wroth</persName> to <placeName>Carthage</placeName> but now attributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>; cf. below, p. 11–5); also <persName>Tolstoi</persName>, op. cit. VIII, p. 837, 13 &amp; 16, and p. 843, 41 (<placeName>Carthage</placeName>); and <persName>Laffranchi</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Numismatica e Scienze Affini</hi> V, 1939, p. 8,
                  Pl. 1, figs. 1–2 (<placeName>Constantinople</placeName>) and p. 11, Pl. V, figs. 1–2 (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>).</p>
               <p>The absence of the letter "D", for "Dominus," suggests that this type might have been issued before the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</persName>; <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> was given
                  the rank of Augustus in 680. But in this case we should expect the re- verse inscription to be in the plural with reference to the Augusti,
                  which it is not; and to judge by dated examples, the "beardless" bronze (cf. below, n. 6) was issued, certainly at least in part, after 685.
                  It is probably best to consider this merely the initial issue of the new emperor, carried on longer at some officinae than at others.</p>

                  bronze coins with beardless portraits, some of which appear to have inscriptions beginning without the "D", although others decidedly do not.
                  One consistent group of bronzes with beardless portrait, in both folles and half-folles, has the word "PAX" on the reverse, and is generally
                  somewhat heavier than other bronze issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> of the same denominations.
                  If, as we have suggested above, pp. <hi rend="italic">gft,</hi> the early years of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> first reign were
                  devoted to promoting peace and harmony throughout the empire and abroad, this series may be linked to the beginning of his reign in a direct
                  way. No conclusions of this sort can safely be drawn, however, until far more research has been devoted to these coins, and the dated examples
                  fully collated. Published examples include <persName>Sabatier</persName>, <hi rend="italic">op. cit</hi>. II, p. 26, 21; <persName>Tolstoi</persName>, <hi rend="italic">op. cit</hi>. VIII, p. 853, 79, &amp; p. 856, 87–8; and <persName>R. Ratto</persName>,

                  bears the same relationship to our Type III as our Type IV–B does to Type IV; but the question hinges on whether or not the emperor is
                  actually wearing the costume of Type III. Inasmuch as <persName>Ricotti Prina</persName> was unable to be certain of this from the

            <head>TYPES OF THE EMPEROR</head>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</persName> has remarked that the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> show a far higher level of technical and artistic proficiency than those of his immediate predecessors,<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> an observation which has been echoed by <persName>Kitzinger</persName>, who would place the beginning of the
               change with the last issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> A far
               more plastic conception of the portrait-image, a general rejection of the conventionalized types which had become so routine in the seventh
               century, in favor of extremely delicate workmanship (drapery details, delineation of eyes, etc.) which represented a new effort at convincing
               realism of imagery; all these are indications of a new policy in the <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> mint. This new style appears to
               continue through the first reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> and that of <persName>Leontius</persName> (leading to the distinction in style which made the misattributed issues of the latter ruler so conspicuous when displayed
               among the flatter, more schematized types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo III</persName>) and even with diminishing force
               through the second reign and beyond, a full generation from the starting date around or before 685.</p>
            <p>One of the results of this apparent interest in the quality of the coin dies, whatever its ultimate cause, is a strong sense of portraiture to be
               gained from perusing these coins, especially the solidi. What the significance of the renewed realism of the coin images may have been, can only
               be determined after a complete examination of all the types involved.</p>
            <p>One type of emperor-portrait is common to three of our five coin types: the figure wearing the divitision and chlamys, crowned, and holding one
               form or another of the globus cruciger, is seen on Types I–A and I (<ref target="#fig-3">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> 1, 1</ref>–<ref target="#fig-4">2</ref>), where <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian
                  II</persName> appears alone, and again on Types IV and IV–B (<ref target="#fig-11">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 9</ref>–<ref target="#fig-13">11</ref>), where he shares honors with his infant son <placeName>Tiberius</placeName>, who is costumed identically.</p>
            <p>In describing Type I, <persName>Wroth</persName> used the terms "mantle and robe" for the emperor's garments, and remarked<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> that here for the first time he <pb n="29"/> could positively describe an emperor as wearing this form of nonmilitary
               dress; he confessed, however, that in its general lines the costume seems to be found on earlier issues, as far back as <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>. It is there, in point of fact, that a careful examination of the coin types will indicate that
               the real introduction of this civil costume must be placed.</p>
            <p>Let us review for a moment the development of <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coin types leading up to this change. The restriction of themes
               on the imperial coinage between the fourth and the sixth centuries, which <persName>Grabar</persName> has so trenchantly described,<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> brought about, by the time of the accession of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName>,
               a situation wherein the variety of coin types in use had become extremely limited indeed. The solidi bore a three-quarter facing bust portrait of
               the emperor, a type which had originated under <persName>Constantius II</persName> in the fourth century (<ref target="#fig-18">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 16</ref>); the ruler appears clad in armor, wearing a helmet, carrying a spear over his right shoulder,
               and bearing a decorated shield before his left one. The fractional gold issues had profile portraits, as did the silver and bronze coins; it was
               on the last-named metal that the only recent modification had been effected, under <persName corresp="#nomisma_anastasius">Anastasius
                  I</persName>, when a new denominational system was established, based upon the follis of 40 nummia, whereby each denomination of bronze coin was
               identified by means of capital letters on the reverse, denoting the value in Greek or Latin numerals.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Beginning with the year 538–9, however, <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName> introduced new types, featuring
               full-face portraits of the emperor, still wearing the cuirass, but now with a crown instead of a helmet, and holding in his right hand the globus
               cruciger (<ref target="#fig-19">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 17</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref> This went into effect in all metals, although the fractional gold,
               on which it was difficult to attempt the frontal bust, tended to continue to represent the monarch in profile as before.</p>
            <p>On the bronze, a system of dating was introduced at the same time as the new type (enabling us to be so precise about the exact time of the
               innovation), by which the reverses were numbered according to the emperor's regnal year. This makes it possible to date the bronze coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName> and of many of his successors, right down to <pb n="30"/>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> The practice can be linked directly to a
                  <placeName>Novella</placeName> of 31 August, 537 A. D., which ordered the abandonment of the old custom of dating by post-consulate, and
               its replacement by the use of the Indiction Year or of the regnal year of the current ruler.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These new types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName> continued to dominate <placeName>Byzantine</placeName>
               coinages, with certain exceptions to be discussed later, until the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>.
               That emperor, in his earlier issues, after employing at first the very dies of <persName>Phocas</persName>,<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref>
               continued the frontal type, showing armor worn under a paludamentum thrown across the shoulders (<ref target="#fig-20">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 18</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref> Starting about 613–14, however, <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName> began to appear in a slightly different costume, using almost the same elements, but in which no
               trace of armor is visible (<ref target="#fig-21">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 19</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> This, we believe, is the true beginning of the mantle-and-robe,
               or more properly chlamys-and-divitision type.</p>
            <p>The costume may be seen in full on some later coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>, where the chlamys falls
               full to the wearer's ankles,<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> and it was employed by his son and successor, <persName>Constans
                  II</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</persName>, on the other hand, dropped this type, and went all the way back to
               the three-quarter-face military portrait which had prevailed from the reign of Constantius II to that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName>, and which may have seemed appropriate to the warlike preoccupations of his troubled reign
                  (<ref target="#fig-22">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 20</ref>); he also employed some of the full-face types which originated with <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName>, just as he issued a series of bronze coins comparable in size and weight only to those of
               that emperor.<ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>What <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> did on his first coins, then, was to revive the types of his
               grandfather, <persName>Constans II</persName>; when he sought to associate himself with his own son, during his second reign, he used the
               same <pb n="31"/> costume and a directly related type to convey the sense of the coregency of the two Augusti, father and son.</p>
            <p>If the designs of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> coin Types IV and IV–B present a certain semblance of originality, this is
               iconographically speaking more apparent than real. The idea of co-rulers clasping a symbol of power simultaneously to indicate their joint
               imperium was common on coin types from the third to the fifth century; the placing of family busts on coin reverses, on the other hand, was a
               favorite practice of the earlier Heraclians. The particular composition here employed was arrived at, no doubt, for Type IV, where it was
               necessary for the two Augusti to support the cross potent, as a symbol among other things of the coin's value; when the type was carried over to
               the obverse, on Type IV–B, and the cross potent had the reverse to itself, the composition with the two co-emperors was retained without
               difficulty.</p>
            <p>The legends, too, "Dominus Iustinianus Perpetuus Augustus," and "Domini Nostri Iustinianus et Tiberius Perpetui Augusti," are in keeping with the
                  <placeName>Roman</placeName> and <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> traditions of coin legends, which the <placeName>Byzantines</placeName> tended to restrict to the barest essentials of titulature and nomenclature.</p>
            <p>Concerning the costume, aside from what evidence we have from coins and other material remains, we can gain considerable information from the
               Book of Ceremonies. Despite its late date, in the tenth century, the antiquity and traditionalism of garments such as these make the evidence of
               this book trustworthy with regard to general significance and applicability.<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The references to the chlamys, when assembled as <persName>Ebersolt</persName> has done,<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref> make it clear that
               this was the garment of highest dignity in the imperial wardrobe, one of the primary symbols of imperial power. Not only was it worn on many,
               indeed on nearly all the great civil and religious festivals of Byzantium, but it was the garment which was placed on the emperor's shoulders at
               his coronation, at the same <pb n="32"/> time that the crown was put on his head; it was worn, too, by the deceased emperor on his catafalque.
               The use of the chlamys as such was not, of course, restricted to the imperial family; while the imperial chlamys was made of purple cloth,
               embroidered in gold, there were similar mantles in other prescribed materials and colors which were worn by the various ranks of court
               dignitaries. As the robes of mandarins of imperial <placeName corresp="#geonames_1814991">China</placeName> were embroidered with dragons of
               different type, so the chlamys of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> dignitary was additionally decorated with an ornate colored tabulum,
               whose embroidered details indicated both his status and the occasion of wearing.</p>
            <p>The divitision, sometimes equated in <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> writings with the ancient chiton, was a belted tunic-like garment
               slightly shorter than the chlamys, which might be worn not only under that cloak, but under the sagion or the tzitzakion, as the occasion
               required. This tunic was worn without an overgarment at the coronation until the moment when the chlamys was placed over the imperial
                  shoulders.<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>As regards the crown, we have considerable information in our sources about a variety of crowns used for various occasions;<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref> but, thus far at any rate, it has proven impossible to relate this information to the visual evidence of the coins and other
               material remains. The type of crown worn by <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> on his coins, apparently a
               fairly plain filleted circlet surmounted in front by a semicircular ornament itself topped by a small cross, appears to have originated with
                  <persName>Constans II</persName>, and is first clearly discernable on that ruler's coins (<ref target="#fig-23">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 21</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName> (and his sons, when shown) wore a similar crown, but one on which the central
               ornament comes down across the front of the circlet, and which was in use from at least the sixth century (<ref target="#fig-20">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 18</ref>–<ref target="#fig-21">19</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref> The type of crown introduced by
                  <persName>Constans II</persName>, on the other hand, remained in use long after the fall of the <placeName>Heraclian
                  Dynasty</placeName>. It is the only type of crown seen on the coins of the <placeName>Isaurians</placeName> (wherever detail is fine enough to
               ensure that a distinct type of specific crown is being portrayed) until the reign of <persName corresp="#numismatics_leo_iv">Leo
                  IV</persName>. At that time, a new crown seems to be introduced, with no semicircle at all, but a simple cross surmounting the front (<ref target="#fig-24">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 22</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref>
               <pb n="33"/> Both this and the preceding type are seen on coins of the succeeding Iconoclast emperors, but by the reign of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41654">Michael IV</persName> the simpler crown-with-cross has become the only type used. As mentioned above, the sources
               indicate that more than one crown was in use by the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> monarchs, at least in the tenth century; but we are
               unable to form even a hypothetical opinion as to which one may have been the dominant type, and hence the one represented numismatical-ly, in the
               seventh and eighth centuries.</p>
            <p>The globus, carried in the ruler's hand as a symbol of world domination, was of course of great antiquity in the <placeName>Roman</placeName>
                  world.<ref target="#CH3-n22">22</ref> Already under the <placeName>Roman</placeName> Republic, it was held by the goddess Roma, a
               representation which survived into Christian times.<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref> In the later Empire, it is seen most frequently surmounted by
               the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q165023">Nike</persName>, who crowns its holder, as on a medallion of Constantius II (<ref target="#fig-26">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 24</ref>),<ref target="#CH3-n24">24</ref> and as such it survived through the first century of the
               Christian Empire. But even during that time the tendency toward Christianization of the imperial symbols was suggested, as on a coin of the
               ephemeral usurper Nepotianus, in 350, where the globus is shown surmounted by the Chi-Rho monogram.<ref target="#CH3-n25">25</ref> It does not
               appear to have received the cross, however, until the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName> (<ref target="#fig-25">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 23</ref>),<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref> at a time when the cross-sceptre also makes its first
               numismatic appearance on the same series,<ref target="#CH3-n27">27</ref> and when the cross as a symbol took on great importance in the imperial
               coinage, as apparently in the general context of religious art as a whole. As regards the globus cruciger, however, it became an integral element
               of the imperial-portrait coin type on the new issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName>, and as such it is
               used in Type I of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, a "normal" attribute of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> ruler.</p>
            <p>The large cross potent on steps, which is used on the reverse of the solidi of Type I (and, on globus or without base, on the fractional gold of
               the series), can also be traced as a type to the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName>, <pb n="34"/>
               <ref target="#CH3-n28">28</ref> where for the first time a new reverse type is introduced, the standing figure of Victory in profile to the left,
               holding before her a tall, broad-armed Latin cross whose outline is decorated with something like pearls (<ref target="#fig-27">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 25</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n29">29</ref> On the basis of the legend, VOT XX MVLT XXX, this issue may be
               linked to the vicennalia of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName>, while the combination of imperial personages in
               whose name the type was struck (obverses of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName>, his wife <persName corresp="#nomisma_aelia_eudocia">Eudocia</persName>, his sister <persName>Pulcheria</persName>, his uncle <persName corresp="#nomisma_honorius">Honorius</persName> the Western emperor, and his aunt <persName>Placidia</persName>) makes it possible to date it
               quite precisely to the year 423 A. D.<ref target="#CH3-n30">30</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This adaptation of the familiar imperial image of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q165023">Nike</persName> planting a trophy in symbol of
               victory was introduced on the coinage of the vicennalia of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName> for good reason:
               the occasion almost certainly was the conclusion of peace, the preceding year, after a brief and successful war against the Sassanian ruler
               BahramV, caused in the first place by religious persecutions against Christian <pb n="35"/> residents of the <placeName>Persian</placeName>
               domain. In the peace treaty, <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName> won new assurances of toleration of the

            <p>For the particular form taken by the cross on this coin type, another contemporary event furnishes the clue. Only two years earlier, in
                  420–1,<ref target="#CH3-n32">32</ref>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName> had sent money to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</placeName> to endow the erection of a great jewelled cross on <placeName>Golgotha</placeName>, on the site of the crucifixion.<ref target="#CH3-n33">33</ref> This great ornamented cross must have been the inspiration for the type placed in the hand of the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q165023">Nike</persName> on the coins of the vicennalia, as it is for succeeding representations of the cross as
               the instrument of Christian imperial victory.</p>
            <p>The type was modified by succeeding rulers, as the cross might or might not be shown with jewelled edges, and as the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q165023">Nike</persName> was turned full-face, and then was transformed into a true Angel (wearing masculine rather than
               feminine garments) on the coins of <persName>Justin I</persName>, from about 519 A. D. (<ref target="#fig-28">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 26</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n34">34</ref> Finally, on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName> II, the supporting figure was dropped entirely,<ref target="#CH3-n35">35</ref> and the cross on
               steps became the standard reverse type of the solidi, as seen on the first issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian
                  II</persName>. On the other hand, as <persName>Frolow</persName> has shown, on his coins of Type II <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> actually reverts to the earlier type, and himself replaces the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q165023">Nike</persName> who originally supported the victorious cross.<ref target="#CH3-n36">36</ref>
            </p>
            <p>On Types II and III, of course, the emperor is wearing a different variety of imperial costume, characterized by the loros, the broad <pb n="36"/> embroidered and bejewelled scarf which was worn wound about the upper part of the body, with its ends falling almost to the feet (<ref target="#fig-7">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 5</ref>–<ref target="#fig-9">7</ref>). Contemporary documentation on this costume is sparse, but its place
               in the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> ceremonial can be ascertained by the use of the invaluable Book of Ceremonies, and most particularly
               by consultation of the chapter on the imperial regalia.<ref target="#CH3-n37">37</ref> In that chapter, we find the loros mentioned with
               reference to only one occasion, Easter Sunday, when, after the preliminary ceremonies in the Triklinos of the Nineteen Akoubitoi, the emperor put
               on the loros and the "white or red crown, as it pleases him," while taking a sceptre in his left hand, and the anexikakia in his right. In this
               costume he proceeded to the mitatorion, the imperial robing room at the Great Church; but he removed the loros in favor of the chlamys before
               participating in the religious ceremonials there. After communion, he resumed the loros for the return to the Palace. So important was this
               particular occasion that Constantine Porphyrogenitus left among his papers an additional essay on the significance of the costume: Book II,
               Chapter 40, is entitled, "Why it is that on Easter Sunday the emperor, the magistri, the proconsuls and the patricians wear the loros."<ref target="#CH3-n38">38</ref> Here the costume is described as symbolizing both the death and the resurrection of <persName corresp="#nomisma_jesus_christ">Christ</persName>; the loros, wound about the body like a winding-sheet, is yet studded with gems and embroidered
               with gold; the sceptre bespeaks <persName>Christ's</persName> victory over death by means of the cross; the anexikakia, the roll, wrapped in
               cloth and filled with dust, recalls our mortal bodies, embraced by the Book of Life.</p>
            <p>Another analogy follows, however: immediately after this description we find a second explanation, namely, that the costume and paraphernalia
               are, essentially, those of the ancient consuls of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>; they are borne by the patricians, then,
               as a reminder of the glories of former times, when men became kings for a year, and assumed not only the privileges, but the heavy
               responsibilities of the administration of the state. This is a clue, obviously: even in the tenth century it <pb n="37"/> was remembered that
               this costume, of which the loros was the most characteristic feature, was that of the <placeName>Roman</placeName> consuls. In the history of
               the consulate under the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> emperors, and in the history of the consular dress, may lie some of the answers we
               seek. Let us first see of what the costume consisted at the apogee of its splendor.</p>
            <p>Study of the most significant of the monuments related to the consular office, that is, the consular diptychs, has revealed most of the
               information necessary to an understanding of the consular costume.<ref target="#CH3-n39">39</ref> The basic elements of the dress were as
               follows: the undermost garment was a long tunic with full sleeves. Over this was worn a shorter, very full and sleeveless colobium, another
               variety of tunic which appears to have entered the consular regalia in the course of the third century A. D.; outermost was the consular toga,
               which might be, according to the importance of the occasion, either the plain white toga of every-day wear, or the purple toga which bears the
               name trabea, and which in its highest grades was of gold, embroidered with pearls and precious stones. This costume was completed by the
               ceremonial boots, or <placeName>calcei</placeName>, and the insignia of office, most particularly the mappa and the sceptre (<ref target="#fig-31">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 29</ref>).<ref target="#CH3-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The simple trabea costume, with a purple trabea rather than the embroidered one, was worn by the Viri consulares, the men of consular rank; the
               consuls themselves during their term of office wore what is called, significantly, the triumphal costume, with the tunic purple and bordered with
               gold, the colobium also purple, and the trabea, which developed during the history of the Empire into the form of a wide scarf decorated with
               gold rosettes. It was <persName>John Lydus</persName>, of our sources, who in the sixth century first applied the Greek word, loros, to the
                  trabea.<ref target="#CH3-n41">41</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In origin, all these garments had their antecedents in <placeName>Roman</placeName> Republican usage, when they had vague associations with
               still earlier traditions of the monarchy. The basic elements of the costume, which was essentially that of the Triumphator, were the tunica
                  palmata<ref target="#CH3-n42">42</ref> worn underneath the toga picta;<ref target="#CH3-n43">43</ref> these were the garments worn by <pb n="38"/> the statue of <persName>Jupiter Capitolinus</persName>, who bestowed victory upon the arms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n44">44</ref> The emperor Augustus made the toga picta a part of his own regular costume
               for ceremonial occasions; the triumphal and consular costumes gradually lost whatever distinctions may have existed between them prior to this
               time, and by the second century of our era were to all intents and purposes identical;<ref target="#CH3-n45">45</ref> at the same time, of
               course, the right to receive a triumph had become the exclusive prerogative of the emperors, so that there was no such thing as a triumphal
               costume for any other member of the state. During the fourth century, the trabea or toga picta assumed its final, narrow form of scarf, as we see
               it in representations of the loros.<ref target="#CH3-n46">46</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The sceptre too was linked to this triumphal iconography of the consular costume, but there was one attribute which was not: the mappa. The mappa
               was held in the consul's right hand at the games over which he presided on the first of January, his inauguration day, and it was thrown down as
               the signal to commence the performance. The first mappae portrayed on the consular diptychs have the appearance of a limp cloth, like the napkins
               for which they were named; but in the sixth century the mappa was given added firmness by the insertion of a roll of paper inside the cloth, as
               described by the Porphyrogenitus in the Book of Ceremonies.<ref target="#CH3-n47">47</ref> This type of mappa received the Greek name akakia,
               whence the parentage of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> anexikakia is direct.<ref target="#CH3-n48">48</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The fact that in its origins the mappa was, and always remained so long as it was an attribute of the consular office properly speaking, a simple
               instrument of the producer of the spectacles, is clear from all the texts. According to Cassiodorus, it dates from the time of <placeName>Nero</placeName>, who one day delayed the start of the games by staying late at table for a particularly fine luncheon. When the crowd in the
               nearby stadium became unruly at waiting so long, the emperor threw his napkin out the window of the dining-hall, as a signal that the proceedings
               might begin without him.<ref target="#CH3-n49">49</ref> Despite the patness of the story, and <pb n="39"/> the skepticism modern students have
               shown toward it, there is no evidence that the word, or the use of the napkin-mappa at the games, antedates the reign of <placeName>Nero</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n50">50</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The consulate, however, underwent a major alteration in the course of the sixth century—a change which some commentators have considered to mark
               the very end of the consulate itself.<ref target="#CH3-n51">51</ref> What had happened was that by the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName> the consulate had become not only a purely formal dignity, bestowing on its bearer merely
               the rights to give certain games, notably those of the first of January, when he was also privileged to free slaves,<ref target="#CH3-n52">52</ref> and the right to bestow private and public gifts in honor of his appointment; but these very honors had become an almost intolerable
               burden for any private citizen, a burden of which the emperor could not but be fully sensible.</p>
            <p>Early in the sixth century the last of the consuls retired in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>; at <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>, after certain lapses of appointment, the naming of consuls ceased entirely in 541. This did not mean, however, that
               the office itself then ceased to exist; instead, there merely ceased to be private holders of the office. At the same time, there remained
               numerous bearers of the title ex-consul, which for centuries had been an honorific bestowed generously upon men who had never held the eponymic
               consulate itself, as well as upon those who had; from 541, this title became more common than ever.<ref target="#CH3-n53">53</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After this time, the consulate proper became purely an imperial office, which the emperor assumed more or less automatically upon commencing his
               reign; as such, its duties were amalgamated with the others embodied in the imperial responsibilities, to such an extent that the consulate
               shortly became just another title to be cited in a full list of the imperial dignities, without any distinction of its functions whatsoever.
                  <persName>Justin II</persName> was the first emperor to celebrate this <pb n="40"/> form of consulate, in 566;<ref target="#CH3-n54">54</ref> it was at this time that the imperial diadem was incorporated into the consular regalia.<ref target="#CH3-n55">55</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is, furthermore, at this time that the consular costume reappears on the imperial coinage, significantly just at the moment that the consulate
               had become exclusively an imperial office. Its first occurrence was in the second year of <persName>Justin II's</persName> successor, <persName>Tiberius II</persName> (<ref target="#fig-29">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 27</ref>);<ref target="#CH3-n56">56</ref> the next emperor, <persName corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</persName>, issued at various periods and mints during his reign "consular" types in bronze,<ref target="#CH3-n57">57</ref>
                  silver,<ref target="#CH3-n58">58</ref> and gold.<ref target="#CH3-n59">59</ref>
               <persName>Phocas</persName> too minted both solidi<ref target="#CH3-n60">60</ref> and bronzes<ref target="#CH3-n61">61</ref> of this kind,
               on which for the first time the consular sceptre appears topped by a cross, instead of by the imperial <placeName>Roman</placeName> eagle
                  (<ref target="#fig-30">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 28</ref>).</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coins bear the image of the emperor as consul for the last time in the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>, on a series over which there had long been uncertainty, but which has now been satisfactorily
               elucidated by <persName>Grierson</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n62">62</ref> The same emperor raised his eldest son, <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>
               <persName>Constantine</persName>, to consular rank on the occasion of his own triumph in 631, after the successful conclusion of the <placeName>Persian</placeName> Wars;<ref target="#CH3-n63">63</ref> thereafter we hear very little of the consular office, although both <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</persName>
               <pb n="41"/> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> occasionally dated their acts by consular as well as
               regnal years, not with standing the fact that the two were identical.<ref target="#CH3-n64">64</ref>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, as we have remarked, during the seventh century the practice of creating honorary consuls, called ex-consuls or ἀπύπἀτωυ,
               became more and more common, as the lead seals of the period, as well as our literary sources, attest.<ref target="#CH3-n65">65</ref> During this
               time, the loros costume, which pertained to the consular functions, became more general in its application to other dignities, as we may find in
               the account of the procession of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName> and his family to the church of <persName>S. Sophia</persName> on the Kalends of January (at the time of the old consular inaugurations), recorded in the Book of Ceremonies:
               the ex-prefects, another honorary class, wore the loros on that occasion, after the fashion of the consuls, as the author expresses it.<ref target="#CH3-n66">66</ref>
            </p>
            <p>During the 68o's, however, it has been noted that the title of exconsul ceases to occur on the lead seals, and seems to have fallen rapidly into
                  disuse.<ref target="#CH3-n67">67</ref> On the other hand, in the following century the title of consul itself reappears as an official rank,
               albeit not a very distinguished one, in the senatorial class. This seems to have been not so much a continuation of the old ex-consular office,
               as a new position in the court hierarchy, which revived the title, but not the office or status, of the old magistracy.<ref target="#CH3-n68">68</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The loros, on the other hand, far from being reserved for this class, became a ceremonial garment for several of the highest classes of the
               nobility, as a number of passages in the Book of Ceremonies make clear. We have already cited the parts of Chapters 46 (37) of Book I, and 40 of
               Book II, which indicate that the only occasion on which the emperor regularly wore the loros was at Easter.<ref target="#CH3-n69">69</ref> This
               is borne out by the description of the ceremonials of Easter, in Book I, Chapter I,<ref target="#CH3-n70">70</ref> where we find the emperor
               putting on the loros and taking in his right hand the akakia, in his left the cross-sceptre.<ref target="#CH3-n71">71</ref> At the same time it
               is clear that, just as in earlier centuries, there were different types of <pb n="42"/> loros to conform to the different ranks entitled to wear
               them: a clear distinction is made between the loroi of cloth-of-gold worn on this occasion by the twelve magistri and proconsuls who were to dine
               with the emperor,<ref target="#CH3-n72">72</ref> and the "golden" loroi worn by the lesser dignitaries to whom they were appropriate.<ref target="#CH3-n73">73</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The loros appears twice more in the Book of Ceremonies: once as the special garment of the "patrician of the girdle;"<ref target="#CH3-n74">74</ref> and again, as worn by various dignitaries of the court at a special reception in the Magnaura in 946 A. D.<ref target="#CH3-n75">75</ref> These passages illustrate very well the restricted character of the use of the costume in the tenth century: The "patrician of the
               girdle," a feminine rank of the very highest degree, seems to have been bestowed especially upon female members of the imperial family who were
               not entitled to the rank of <placeName>Augusta</placeName>; the only known bearer of the title was the mother-in-law of the emperor <persName>Theophilus</persName>, <persName>Theoctiste</persName>, for whom it was probably created.<ref target="#CH3-n76">76</ref> The
               relatively limited number of occasions on which the garment, at least in its most elaborate form, might be worn is illustrated by the description
               in Book II, for it is expressly stated that on that occasion things were arranged in the Chrysotriclinium (the site of the loros reception on
               Easter Sunday of Book I, Chapter I) <hi rend="italic">just as on the occasion of Easter</hi>.<ref target="#CH3-n77">77</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This conscious transfer of the consular costume from its former secular milieu to a religious one, from the first of January to one of the most
               sacred of Christian festivals, Easter, is undocumented so far as any literal account of the shift, or the reason therefor, is concerned. On the
               other hand, <persName>Ebersolt's</persName> notice on the loros<ref target="#CH3-n78">78</ref> investigates the evidence, which the author
               felt was sufficiently clear to permit the conclusion that the celebration of the consular procession, with the attendant distribution of largess
               which came to constitute the literal meaning of the Greek word for "consulship", was shifted during the eighth century to Eastertime, and that
               this was the simple reason for the wearing of the consular costume at Easter in the tenth century, <pb n="43"/> when the consular procession
               itself had at last been completely forgotten, except perhaps by the antiquaries.</p>
            <p>The following is the evidence for such a conclusion. The first occasion on which the consular ceremony was recorded, after the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>, was at the close of the year 718, when, in December, a son and heir was born to
               the new emperor <persName corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo III</persName>. This son, who was to be <persName>Constantine V</persName>,
               was baptized at the earliest possible moment—before, in fact, the infant had been house-broken; after the close of an embarrassing New Year's
               episode at the font of the Baptistry of <persName>S. Sophia</persName>, the consular largess was distributed to the crowd outdoors.<ref target="#CH3-n79">79</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The next recorded instance was at Eastertide of 768, when <persName>Constantine V</persName> himself had produced heirs; he held a multiple
               coronation ceremony to establish the titles of all his family. On Good Saturday, he crowned his wife <persName corresp="#nomisma_aelia_eudocia">Eudocia</persName> as <placeName>Augusta</placeName>; the following day he made two of his sons Caesars, and a
               third one Nobilissimus. That same day, as the rulers were proceeding from the Great Palace to <persName>S. Sophia</persName>, they ὺπατεἱαυ
               ἐπоἱησαυ, <hi rend="italic">as well as</hi> distributing largess.<ref target="#CH3-n80">80</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in 799, at Easter, the empress <persName>Irene</persName>, then sole ruler of the Eastern Empire, made a distribution of money after
               the custom of the consuls, as it was expressed.<ref target="#CH3-n81">81</ref> Finally, in 867, after Basil the Macedonian had murdered his
               patron <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName>, he made a consular procession, with the attendant largesses, after
               the coronation ceremony. This took place on the twenty-fourth of September.<ref target="#CH3-n82">82</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Three of these ceremonials, we see, were in reality attached to occurrences other than simple consular processions: coronations in two cases, a
               baptism in another. Only the episode under <persName>Irene</persName> seems to indicate that there persisted a regular practice of holding
               the consular procession regularly without special motivation, and then at Easter; this would be an ordinary event which would only be mentioned
               by the chroniclers when something unusual took place, or when something so unprecedented as a woman's assuming the consular duties took
               place.</p>
            <p>Even this meager evidence, however, seems to be enough to indicate at least the outlines of the picture. We have seen that, from the <pb n="44"/>
               time of <persName>Justin II</persName>, the emperor counted his consular years as he did his regnal ones; the consular procession thus
               became associated with the ceremonial of coronation, if not at this time, then shortly thereafter. For this reason, when necessity did not
               dictate the date of a coronation—that is to say on occasions when a living emperor was raising an heir or other relative to a higher dignity—then
               that ceremonial might be arranged to take place at the same time as the regular consular celebration. This would explain the choice of a date for
               the coronation of the family of <persName>Constantine V</persName>, at Easter; if we extend the analogy back another fifty years, we may
               take it to mean that at the outset of <persName>Leo III's</persName> reign, the consular procession was still held in January. That, then,
               was the fixed part of the recorded ceremonial, and this would explain the ill-advised rush to baptize the infant princeling, since otherwise it
               would have been preferable to postpone matters a full year for the proper occasion to arrive again. It may also be significant that it was after
               the time of the incident which earned for <persName>Constantine V</persName> the sobriquet "Copronymus" that the date of the consular
               procession was changed. All this, however, remains largely conjectural at the present state of our knowledge of the sources.</p>
            <p>What is clear, however, is that the old significance of the processus consularis, namely, victory and triumph, and of the consular costume
               itself, had not been forgotten in the mid-<placeName>Byzantine</placeName> period, but had been translated from the imperial into Christian
               imagery; this is, fundamentally, why the Book of Ceremonies was right in giving not one but two reasons for the wearing of the loros at Easter.
               It is also the reason why (contrary to <persName>Ebersolt</persName>) the celebration and, still more permanently, the costume attached
               themselves to Easter, the most triumphant of Christian feasts, and not the other way round.</p>
            <p>The difficulty in tracing the history of titular office and associated ceremonials of the consulship after the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName> makes it impossible to determine with certainty the precise significance of the appearance of
               the consular costume on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>—if indeed there was one single
               "precise" significance to its use. But even if there was no single meaning to the introduction of this costume and its attributes, we know that
               it was not done without clear purpose in mind. We have been able to observe that the office was undergoing modifications at precisely this time,
               and the honorary title of exconsul <pb n="45"/> seems to have been suppressed almost at the outset of his first reign; it is tempting to risk the
               conjecture that the office was discontinued deliberately at this time, in conjunction with what seems to have been a concerted policy of
               restricting the powers of the nobility.<ref target="#CH3-n83">83</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We are not permitted to hypothesize that any of the changes in date of the procession, or the institution of a new consular order, took place
               before the <placeName>Isaurian</placeName> dynasty came to power. The latter move, as a matter of fact, is one more typical of a
               newly-established ruling group than of one long in power. We may suggest, however, certain things with which the use of the costume on the coins
               of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> may have been associated: If the coins commemorate some more or less
               specific event, there can be no question that it was of the highest ceremonial order; and the date may well have coincided with the date of the
               consular celebration, whether that was then held in January or at Easter. There can be little question, moreover, that the triumphal
               significance, in the broadest sense, of the costume was something of which the designer of the new coin type was fully aware.</p>

            <head>TYPES OF CHRIST</head>
            <p>The major innovation of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> coins lies in the introduction of two portraits of Christ as the obverse types
               of three of his issues.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> Of these two types,<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> the first, seen on our coins of Type II,
               and which we shall call Christ-type A (<ref target="#fig-32">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 30</ref>), is broad-faced and round of head; the hair is long, falling behind the shoulders. The right
               hand, as we have remarked, appears in front of the right shoulder in the gesture of blessing, while in front of the left breast is held the
               Book.</p>
            <p>If we look for parallels to this Type A, we find that there are no surviving antecedents in Christian art so far as it has been preserved. Other
               bearded portraits of Christ of course had appeared long before this date, particularly from the fourth century on, but all lack the distinctive
               characteristics of Type A: the wavy hair and beard, the rounded head, and the clearly marked part in the hair, from which two tiny locks stray
               down onto the forehead.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>But if Type A appears seemingly for the first time on these coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, its
               subsequent history is, by contrast, quite well documented, and of the greatest importance to later <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> art. It
               does not recur, naturally enough, during the Iconoclastic Controversy, <pb n="47"/> but we find Type A used almost immediately after the
               Reinstatement of the Images, on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName> (842–867) (<ref target="#fig-33">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 31</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref> With the inscription changed to read simply "Jesus Christos," an
               almost exact copy of the coin type of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> appears on the reverse of <persName>Michael Ill's</persName> gold coins, but with a significant variation: instead of falling behind both shoulders, as on the
               pre-Iconoclastic coins, Christ's hair in this case seems to trail down in front of His left shoulder. This can only be an error made in copying
               the earlier cointype, in which the die-cutter confused the lines of the pallium on the type of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> coin for
               locks of hair; it proves, most significantly, that the pre-Iconoclast coins, on which the distinction between hair and garment was very slight,
               must have been the models for these coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName>.</p>
            <p>Later issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName> correct this confusion (<ref target="#fig-34">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 32</ref>),<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> as does the die of a gold bulla of <persName>Michael's</persName> murderer and successor, Basil I.<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> Still another issue of Basil I, his regular solidi, supplants
               this image of Christ with a new one: it is Christ at full length, seated blessing on a lyre-backed throne, holding in his left hand the Book of
               Gospels; the legend reads "IHS XPS REX REGNANTIUM" (<ref target="#fig-35">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 33</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref> Both the details of the head and upper parts of the body, and the
               legend, support the identification of this figure with the bust-portrait on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName> as well as, by extension, the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>. The only
               details at variance are the extended right arm of the enthroned figure, as against the inward-turned arm on the bust-type, and the presence of a
               nimbus enclosing the cross behind Christ's head.<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="48"/>
            <p>These details, which may in part be accounted for by the different spatial arrangement of the new coin-type, are scarcely more than expected
               variations in the transmission of a standard type; it would seem clear that, from the point of view of the artists and die-designers of the
               post-Iconoclastic period, the Christ-type A of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> was believed to be a
               segment of a larger picture of the enthroned Christ, which was associated with the special title, 'Rex Regnantium." It was not, therefore, a
               simple <hi rend="italic">imago clipeata</hi> in the classical sense, a medallion portrait complete within its frame,<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref>
               which the earlier coins portrayed; as the unsupported Book, implying the existence of a left hand, shows, it was rather a segment of a larger
               picture, and in the strictest sense was incomplete in itself: the coin of Basil I, then, shows us what the Macedonian period understood the full
               prototype, in a general way, to have looked like.</p>
            <p>Out of the bust-type of Christ 'Rex Regnantium," on the other hand, there evolved, shortly after the time of these coins of Basil I, the image of
               Christ Pantocrator, a true <hi rend="italic">clipeus</hi> image, a purely circular portrait of God the Father seen through the image of Christ
               His Son, complete and perfect as given within its frame (<ref target="#fig-38">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 36</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We have already remarked that the artists and iconographers of the post-Iconoclastic period considered our Christ-type A as part of a <pb n="49"/> picture of the enthroned Christ; it behooves us to enquire if this image had any currency beyond the coins. As it happens, the answer is
               immediately at hand: One of the finest of the mosaics recently uncovered in the church of <persName>Hagia Sophia</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_istanbul">Istanbul</placeName> portrays just this figure of Christ on the lyre-backed throne (<ref target="#fig-37">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 35</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref> The work of the Byzantine Institute has revealed the great
               mosaic over the central doorway of the narthex, where it had long been known to exist, since it was drawn by <persName>Fossati</persName>
               and published by <persName>Salzenberg</persName> in the nineteenth century.<ref target="#CH4-n12">12</ref> Here is the very image of Basil
               I's coin, albeit in far more classically elegant style; and at Christ's feet bows in humblest proskynesis the Emperor of the Romans, a figure
               frequently identified as <persName>Leo</persName> VI, but, even more probably, <persName>Leo's</persName> father Basil I the Macedonian
                  himself.<ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The attributes of this Christ figure are of the greatest importance in the imperial symbolism, as Grabar has shown in his few pages on the
               subject of the emperor in adoration.<ref target="#CH4-n14">14</ref> The lyre-backed throne is not a generalized type of throne, but a very
               specific one, which appears on the imperial coinage from the fifth century onward, and is almost certainly a particular throne used in the
               imperial ceremonial; it is found especially on coin types showing the synthronos <pb n="50"/> of two or more Augusti, as on the coins of <persName>Leo I</persName> and <persName>Leo II</persName>,<ref target="#CH4-n15">15</ref>. of <persName>Justin I</persName> with
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName> (<ref target="#fig-36">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 34</ref>),<ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref> or of <persName>Justin II</persName> with his wife <persName>Sophia</persName>,<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref> where the motif appears for the last time prior to the Iconoclastic period, when it
               was revived and used frequently on the coins.</p>
            <p>The inscription on the Book, which we may read in the mosaic of <persName>Hagia Sophia</persName>, is as follows: "Peace be unto you; I am
               the Light of the World."<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref> The Evangelical source of both elements of this formula is well known;<ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref> yet they had so important a place in the symbolism of imperial <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> that this derivation seems almost of equal importance with the biblical one.<ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref> The Pax Romana is a
               well-known concept of late antiquity; its transition into Christian imagery may be studied in the Homily on Matthew ii, 1, of <persName>John Chrysostom</persName>, which embodies a vision of the Pax in Heaven after a victorious war conducted by Christ against sin and death, and in
               which Christ enthroned presides over a glorious Triumph.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref> The concept of the emperor as Lux Mundi was also as old
               as the <placeName>Roman</placeName> Empire—and had preRoman antecedents as well—for it entered <placeName>Roman</placeName> panegyric
               literature with the work of Horace.<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref> The cult of Sol Invictus revived its popularity in the third century, and
               sustained it well into the fourth, after the Christianization of the Empire itself. After 400 or so it lapsed into disuse, until it was revived
               in the time of <persName>Justin II</persName> by <persName>Corippus</persName>, the poet who perhaps has best right to the title of the
               last of the long line of <placeName>Roman</placeName> panegyrists.<ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref> In describing a ceremony taking place in
                  <persName>S. Sophia</persName>, <persName>Corippus</persName> actually compares Christ the Light of the World with the emperor:
               beginning with a paraphrase of the Credo, "Jesus natus, non factus, plenum de lumine lumen," he <pb n="51"/> describes the prayer of <persName>Justin II</persName> before Christ, and concludes, "quem Christus amat rex magnus, amatur. Ipse regit reges, ipse et non sub-ditur
                  ulli."<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref> The concepts of Emperor-Light and Christ-Light continue side by side into the Book of Ceremonies;<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref> thence the imagery proceeds to flower in the literature of Comnenian and even later times.</p>
            <p>It is clear, then, that this image was a particularly imperial one; and we know that Basil I especially revered Christ as Rex Regnantium, to whom
               he gave credit for placing himself and his House upon the imperial throne.<ref target="#CH4-n26">26</ref> Since this title is so plainly linked
               to this one particular image, as it occurs on Basil's own coins, we may infer that Basil's worship of the Rex Regnantium was in fact directed to
               a specific image of the imperial Christ.</p>
            <p>The title Rex Regnantium itself has antecedents in the New Testament. Christ is called "King of Kings" (Rex Regum in the Vulgate) three times, in
               I <persName>Timothy</persName> vi, 15, and in Revelation xvii, 14 and xix, 16 (in xix, 15, the term "Pantocrator" is employed in the Greek);
               but whereas in the latter cases the Greek agrees with the Latin, reading Bασιλεὺς Bασιλέωυ, in I Timothy the Greek is Bασιλεὺς τῶυ Bασιλευόντων,
               that is to say, "King of Those Who Rule," our Rex Regnantium. The distinction is subtle, but definite: Christ as King of Kings is the supreme
               power, the divine being having authority over all beings; but as Rex Regnantium He is placed in a particular relationship to the rulers of other
               men. This implies that He rules through the rulers of the earth, rather than directly over each individual human being.</p>
            <p>The title of Rex Regnantium is applied to Christ in the <persName>Cherubic Hymn</persName>, the portion of the liturgy sung during the Great
               Entrance of the Elements of the Mass from the Prothesis to the Altar.<ref target="#CH4-n27">27</ref> This hymn, which with the Great Entrance
               itself is a relatively late addition to <pb n="52"/> the Eastern liturgy, is said by <persName>Cedrenus</persName> to have been incorporated
               into that liturgy at the order of <persName>Justin II</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n28">28</ref> This assertion seems to be corroborated by
               the fact that the first mention of the Cherubicon occurs in 582, in a sermon protesting its use—and hence implying that it was then a relative
               novelty—by Eutychius of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n29">29</ref> The appelation which concerns us does not appear
               in the normal form of the <placeName>Cherubic Hymn</placeName>, however, but in a special form, the Proper of Easter Eve: 'O Υάρ βασιλεὺς τῶυ
               βασιλευόυτωυ, ϰριστòς ὁ Θεóς.<ref target="#CH4-n30">30</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The title, King of Those Who Rule, is also applied to Christ in a letter of <persName>Pope</persName>
               <persName>Leo II</persName> to the emperor <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</persName>, dated on the Nones of
               May, 682.<ref target="#CH4-n31">31</ref> From this occasion to the time of the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> is a matter of but a decade or so; after the use of the title on these coins, it seems to have lapsed during the
               Iconoclastic period, until its great revival in popularity in the second half of the ninth century.</p>
            <p>When we have come this far in investigating this figure of the Enthroned Christ Rex Regnantium, and have established the antiquity of the
               elements involved, insofar as it is possible to trace them, we are compelled to ask ourselves if there was not some monumental prototype, prior
               to the mosaic of <persName>Hagia Sophia</persName>, which determined its characteristics? The answer must lie in the realm of hypothesis,
               incapable of absolute proof; and yet there is such a concordance of circumstantial evidence on the matter that it is difficult to reject the
               answer which presents itself.</p>
            <p>Unquestionably, the preeminent image of the Enthroned Christ after the Restoration of the Images was the one in the apse of the <pb n="53"/>
               Chrysotriclinium of the Great Palace.<ref target="#CH4-n32">32</ref> Before this image the emperor prayed, as his first official act on any great
               feast day;<ref target="#CH4-n33">33</ref> directly beneath it was the imperial throne itself, from which the greatest affairs of the state were
               conducted. The emperor's obeisance before this image recalls that of the emperor before the Christ Enthroned in <persName>S.
                  Sophia</persName>: and the mosaic there stands over the Imperial Doorway, where in turn the emperor made obeisance before entering the Great
                  Church.<ref target="#CH4-n34">34</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The image of Christ in the Chrysotriclinium was erected by <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName>; but the same
               texts which give us this information, reveal that this work was simply the restoration of an image which had existed there before the Iconoclasm.
               An epigram of Menander Protector states, "The light of Truth hath shone forth again, and blunts the eyes of the false teachers. Piety hath
               increased and Error is fallen; Faith flourisheth and Grace groweth. For behold, Christ pictured again shines above the imperial throne and
               overthrows the dark heresies. And above the entrance, like a holy door, is imaged the guardian Virgin. The Emperor and the Patriarch, as
               victorious over Error, are pictured near with their fellow-workers, and all around, as sentries of the house, are angels, disciples, martyrs,
               priests: whence we call this now the Christotriclinium, instead of by its former name Chrysotriclinium, since it has the throne of the Lord
               Christ and of His Mother, and the images of the Apostles and of <persName>Michael</persName>, author of wisdom."<ref target="#CH4-n35">35</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Again we read, "O Emperor <persName>Michael</persName>, as preserving the bright preciousness of the ancient image, and as conqueror of all
               fleshly <pb n="54"/> stains, thou dost picture the Lord in colors too, establishing by deed the word of dogma."<ref target="#CH4-n36">36</ref>
            </p>
            <p>What <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName> had done, then, was to re-erect in its former place a copy of the
               Enthroned Christ image which had existed in the Chrysotriclinium before the destruction of the images.<ref target="#CH4-n37">37</ref> The
               responsibility for the first image, erected in the pre-Iconoclastic period, cannot be established with certainty; what our sources do tell us,
               however, is that the building, an eight-sided domed chamber with numerous dependencies, was erected in its final form by <persName>Justin II</persName>,<ref target="#CH4-n38">38</ref> and its decoration carried out, or at least completed—the wording of the original is
               slightly ambiguous—by his successor, <persName>Tiberius II</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n39">39</ref> A prototype may have existed already
               on the site, a building of the emperor <persName>Marcian</persName> a century earlier.<ref target="#CH4-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is curious to note, then, how many elements of the Macedonian image of Christ Enthroned as Rex Regnantium, illustrated in the narthex mosaic
               at <persName>S. Sophia</persName>, also appear at this particular time: The lyre-backed throne on the coins of <persName>Justin
                  II</persName> (whose successor renounced this type of "majestas" coin-image<ref target="#CH4-n41">41</ref>); the concepts of both Christ and the
               Emperor as Lights for the World, employed by <persName>Corippus</persName>, the court poet; as well as the introduction of the very title of
               Christ, Rex Regnantium, in the <placeName>Cherubic Hymn</placeName>. So all the elements of the concept of the Enthroned Christ Rex
               Regnantium, <pb n="55"/> Light of the World and Bestower of Peace, were current at one precise point in <placeName>Byzantine</placeName>
               history; it seems more than probable that the image produced during the Macedonian Dynasty as the supreme symbol of the divine bestowal of
               imperial power could have originated at this particular moment.</p>
            <p>This concept of the bestowal of power by Christ seems to have been present almost constantly in the mind of <persName>Justin
                  II</persName>,<ref target="#CH4-n42">42</ref> but he gave it fullest expression in his famous abdication speech on the occasion of the elevation
               of <persName>Tiberius II</persName> to the throne; phrases such as "Behold the insignia of supreme power; you are about to receive them not
               from my hand, but from the hand of God,"<ref target="#CH4-n43">43</ref> are addressed to his successor, while the people are told that their new
               emperor is being given them not by <persName>Justin</persName> himself, but by the deity.<ref target="#CH4-n44">44</ref> According to <persName>Justin</persName>, the words of the speech were dictated to him as he spoke by an angel, and the chroniclers state that they were
               taken down verbatim by secretaries, for the edification of posterity.</p>
            <p>Our evidence is thus quite circumstantial, but nonetheless it is more than tempting to conceive of <persName>Justin II</persName> delivering
               this speech in his own Chrysotriclinium, pointing as he speaks to the very image of this Bestower of Power. Nor would this have been impossible,
               in the light of the evidence of our sources on the history of the structure, since they make it clear that <persName>Tiberius II</persName>
               was merely finishing the work begun by his predecessor when he decorated the interior of the throne-room; they do not specify whether part of the
               decoration was already in place, or if none of it had actually been begun at the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName>' accession.</p>
            <p>We know that the image of Christ was in the conch of a sort of apse, at the east side of the building;<ref target="#CH4-n45">45</ref> indeed, the
               general scheme seems to have resembled closely that of the church of <persName>S. Vitale</persName>, at <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>,
               and of other eight-sided structures of the same <pb n="56"/> period.<ref target="#CH4-n46">46</ref> The example of <persName>S.
                  Vitale</persName> shows us that the decoration of the apse was considered the most important feature in such a building, and therefore the first
               to be executed—so that if <persName>Justin II</persName> lived to see any decoration completed inside his Chrysotriclinium, he would
               probably have seen the image of the Rex Regnantium!</p>
            <p>Whoever was responsible for the erection of the original mosaic image, its importance to us is clear: It seems almost incontrovertible that this
               was the ikon which was reproduced after the Iconoclasm by <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName>, who also employed
               it on his coins, as did Basil I; finally, another mosaic of a similar type was placed over the imperial doorway at <persName>Hagia
                  Sophia</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n47">47</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This being the case, the position of our Christ-type A on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>
               becomes equally apparent: it must have been the model for the coin type of <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName>,
               and hence must have been considered by the artists and designers of the ninth century to be a faithful copy of the great image in the
               Chrysotriclinium as it had existed when the coin was struck; it may even have served as one of the models for their reproduction of the Palace
               mosaic, since we do not know what other evidence was available after the depredations of the Iconoclasts.</p>
            <p>The concept of the deity as bestower of dominion, as <hi rend="italic">pambasileus,</hi> which we find expressed at both turning points in the
               history of the Chrysotriclinium mosaic by <persName>Justin II</persName> and by Basil I, had of course great antiquity in the Mediterranean
               world; in the <persName>Greco-Roman</persName> sphere, the supreme <hi rend="italic">pambasileus</hi> was most often <persName>Zeus-Jupiter</persName>, who had been called by that epithet as early as Homeric Greek <pb n="57"/> times.<ref target="#CH4-n48">48</ref> The
               concept of <persName>Jupiter</persName> as <hi rend="italic">pambasileus</hi> doubtless played a part in the formation of the <placeName>Roman</placeName> triumphal imagery, in which the triumphator–and later the consul as well—assumed the garb of <persName>Jupiter Capitolinus</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n49">49</ref> A splendid illustration of the concept of allpowerful <persName>Jupiter</persName> in the imperial art was formerly in the Golden House of <placeName>Nero</placeName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, where a fresco of Jove the Thunderer occupied the center of a circular (domed?) ceiling, enthroned on
               clouds, and surrounded by an entourage of gods, goddesses, Tritons and other mythological figures.<ref target="#CH4-n50">50</ref>
            </p>
            <p>But the image of <persName>Zeus-Jupiter</persName> which most fully expressed to the ancients this concept of the world-ruler was the great
               chryselephantine statue at Olympia, the work of Phidias. Writers of all nations, pagans and Christians alike, paid tribute to the immense
               impression wrought upon the classical mind by this statue.<ref target="#CH4-n51">51</ref> We can see from the statement of Origen that this one
               sculpture did not receive the condemnation which the Christians gave other images of the pagan divinities.<ref target="#CH4-n52">52</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The later history of the statue has been pieced together,<ref target="#CH4-n53">53</ref> so that we may trace its movements after the abolition
               of the Olympic festivals in 394 A. D. by <persName>Theodosius I.</persName> At that time, Phidias' sculpture was still in its place, but
               when, during the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_theodosius_ii">Theodosius II</persName> (406–450), the temple of Zeus at Olympia burned to
               the ground, the statue was no longer inside it. In the interval, it had been transported to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> and set up
               in the palace of a certain Lausos, in a gallery otherwise known as the Lauseion, along with such other famous works of classical art as the Hera
               of Samos, the Knidian Aphrodite, and the Kairos of Lysippos. The Lauseion, however, burned in its turn in the year 462, and all these
               masterpieces perished together.</p>
            <pb n="58"/>
            <p>It was just at this time that there originated a legend which has long intrigued historians of Christian art. In the time of the <persName>Archbishop Gennadios</persName>, who was Patriarch of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> from 458 to 471, a certain painter
               made an ikon, at the instigation of a pagan, portraying Christ in the likeness of Zeus (ἐυ τάξει Διός); the painter's hand and arm withered in
               consequence of his blasphemous act, but he was healed miraculously through the intercession of <persName>Gennadios</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n54">54</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The early versions of this legend do not amplify the words, "in the likeness of Zeus," but when the miracle was recounted by <persName>John of Damascus</persName>, the famous eighth-century iconophile described most explicitly his conception of a figure of Christ in the likeness
               of Zeus: "The hair on the head was painted as dividing on either side so that the eyes were not hidden. For in such manner the Greeks painted
               their Zeus."<ref target="#CH4-n55">55</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Such a legend would not have arisen, obviously, had there not been some occasion when images of Christ were considered to have been derived from
               those of the pagan Zeus; and modern scholarship has certainly been able to show that more than one pagan deity provided the antecedents for the
               appearance of Christ in one or another of the likenesses known to the Christian Empire. But with regard to the Phidian Zeus, there seems to be a
               particular link with the Pantocrator-Pambasileus type of Christ, which has often been advanced, and as often rejected,<ref target="#CH4-n56">56</ref> especially since comparison with the best known ancient reproduction of the Phidian statue, the famous coin of Elis which portrays
               on one side the enthroned figure of the god and on the other his head in profile, shows little resemblance to the familiar Christian image.<ref target="#CH4-n57">57</ref> What had been lacking, however, was an opportunity to compare the two images in full-face, which is the key to the
               Christian representation. With the general acceptance of the <pb n="59"/> marble head of Zeus from Mylasa in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_caria">Caria</placeName>, now in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, as a good and accurate copy of the
               Phidian work (<ref target="#fig-39">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 37</ref>),<ref target="#CH4-n58">58</ref> however, this has become possible. Viewed from full-face, this
               head represents a striking parallel to the appearance of our Type A head, both in its general proportions of one part in relation to another, and
               in the strongly marked parting of the hair which <persName>John Damascene</persName> so stressed.</p>
            <p>The model for our Christ-type A, and before it for the great apse mosaic of the Chrysotriclinium, may indeed have been the Phidian Zeus. This
               would have been completely sensible, in terms of the ideation of the sixth century, when paganism had been so thoroughly suppressed (at least at
               the intellectual level) that there needed be no longer any fear of contamination in borrowing from its imagery in this overt way; yet not so long
               a time since the destruction of the statue itself that its overwhelmingly impressive appearance could have been forgotten (since the very story
               of <persName>Gennadios</persName>' miracle serves to demonstrate that copies of some sort of Zeus image must have been made). The great
               masterpiece of Phidias seems to have lived on, as one of the most important symbols of the divine Empire, of Christ's rule on Earth through the
               agency of the Basileus appointed by Him.</p>
            <p>Our Type B of Christ portrait is characterized by the same attitude, garments, attributes and legend as Type A, but its facial features are
               wholly different: the head is longer, the face thin and triangular, the hair and beard scant and very curly (<ref target="#fig-40">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 38</ref>). Our first source of information on this type is in the same passage in the Ecclesiastical
               History of <persName>Theodoros Anagnostes</persName> where we found the story of the painter healed by the Patriarch <persName>Gennadios</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n59">59</ref> After concluding his story of the miracle wrought by the benevolent archbishop, Theodoros
               goes on to say, "But one of the historians<ref target="#CH4-n60">60</ref> says, that the other type of the Savior, the woolly and short-haired
               (or scant-haired), is taken for granted as the more truthful."<ref target="#CH4-n61">61</ref> This description would seem to fit, <pb n="60"/>
               above all extant early portraits of Christ, the one used on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian
               II</persName>.</p>
            <p>We learn more about this figure when <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q319403">Theophanes</persName> repeats the story of <persName>Gennadios</persName>, basing his remarks upon Theodoros, but adding some new information: "But certain of the historians say that the woolly and
               short-haired type is the more familiar in the time of the Savior."<ref target="#CH4-n62">62</ref> These remarks are repeated by such later
               writers as <persName corresp="#nomisma_nikephorus">Nicephorus</persName> Callistos,<ref target="#CH4-n63">63</ref> and were transmitted to
               the seventeenth-century Athos Painter's Manual, which includes in its description of the appearance of Christ from the original and earliest
               sources, mention of "the head frizzy-haired tending to blond, the beard being black."<ref target="#CH4-n64">64</ref> So we still seem to be
               dealing with our Type B; and since the type described is scarcely that of the customary Christ figure of late <placeName>Byzantine</placeName>
               times, the references to the antiquity of the image must be given great stress in considering the significance of the passage.</p>
            <p>All these terms applied to this image of Christ, such as "more truthful," "more familiar in the time of the Savior," "as it has been transmitted
               by those who first saw it," point in the same direction as the anatomical characteristics of the portrait type itself would indicate: toward an
               origin in the <placeName>Syrian</placeName> and Palestinian sphere of early Christianity. And they also suggest strongly a link with the most
               important group of early portrait-ikons of Christ, the "acheiropoietai," the images not painted by human hands, but preserving the actual living
               appearance of Christ by miraculous means.<ref target="#CH4-n65">65</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We have a description of one such portrait of Christ said to have been painted during His lifetime, which was erected in the Praetorium of the
               palace of Pontius Pilate, the later church of <persName>S. Sophia</persName> at <pb n="61"/>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n66">66</ref> The sixth-century pilgrim <persName>Anthony of Placentia</persName> (the modern Piacenza) described the picture, and significantly enough, describes the head as having "capillos
                  subannellatos."<ref target="#CH4-n67">67</ref> So it would seem that here we are also dealing with a version of the same curly-haired portrait
               of Christ as in the previous cases. And the same is true of the famous letter purporting to have been written by <persName>John of
                  Damascus</persName> to the Emperor <persName>Theophilus</persName> (<persName>John</persName>, of course, died before 754, while <persName>Theophilus</persName>' reign began only in 829), which states that <persName>Constantine</persName> the Great had the figure of
               Christ put on paintings and mosaics (in the Holy Land), and represented the Savior "as the old authorities had described, with eyebrows that
               joined, fine eyes, a long nose, <hi rend="italic">frizzy hair</hi>, a black beard, flesh tones like His mother's, the color of wheat."<ref target="#CH4-n68">68</ref> Although its authorship may be in doubt, there can be no question that this letter was a product of the
               Iconoclastic Controversy, or that the description is of our Type B.</p>
            <p>The course of history has destroyed the monumental records which would make it possible to verify beyond all doubt the origin which these scraps
               of evidence suggest for this type of Christ-portrait; still there are a few pictures which may be cited for comparison with our Christ-type B,
               and which tend to bear out an attribution of this type to the area of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254930">Palestine</placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the famous Rabula Gospels in the Laurentian Library in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName>, whose colophon not only
               dates the manuscript very precisely to 586 A. D., but locates its place of composition in exactly the region of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, we find in the Dedication miniature a figure of Christ whose head, with its thick curly hair, short
               black beard, and triangular face, is remarkably close to our Type B (<ref target="#fig-42">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X, 40</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n69">69</ref> Another manuscript, <placeName>Syrian</placeName> in script,
               and dated to 634 A. D., has a miniature with a head of Christ still closer to our Type B.<ref target="#CH4-n70">70</ref> The type <pb n="62"/>
               appears also in a fresco from a burial-crypt at <placeName>Abu-Girgeh</placeName> (near <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>), which Morey dates as post-sixth-century (<ref target="#fig-41">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 39</ref>);<ref target="#CH4-n71">71</ref> the radical difference between this type and the beardless youth
               who more customarily represented Christ in Alexandrian art is explained by Morey as the result of the increasing rapprochement of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> after Chalcedon (451), with
               its accompanied infiltration of <placeName>Syrian</placeName> monks and their foundations, as well as their theological principles, into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n72">72</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The very fact that this type, although preserved in literature and memory, tended to disappear after the seventh century, when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> fell to the Moslems, seems to provide negative evidence for its identification with that area. A
               reflection of the type does appear again in the eleventh century, however, in a mosaic at <persName>S. Sophia</persName> at <placeName>Kiev</placeName>, and again in 1164, in a fresco at <placeName>Nerez</placeName>, and in 1197, in a fresco at <placeName>Neredicy</placeName>; this group was distinguished by <persName>Ainalov</persName> as the "Priest-Christ," an interpretation based upon the
               apocryphal tradition that Christ was a priest in the Temple at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH4-n73">73</ref>–perhaps another indication of the indissoluble bond which seems to tie this type of Christ-image to its
               Palestinian origins.</p>
            <p>This is a very different type of Christ, with very different associations and implications, from the imperial Rex Regnantium image which we first
               investigated. Why this type should have appeared together with the other on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, and what the total significance of the various combinations of figures may have been, can only be determined when we
               know what the motives for <persName>Justinian II's</persName> innovations were in the first place, and what the circumstances were in which
               these innovations were made.</p>

               <p>The absence of a nimbus is a puzzling and, as of the present time, inexplicable detail of the Christ-images of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>. There is no indication, however, that it presents a significant obstacle to the
                  elucidation of the coin types; it must simply be accepted as, most probably, a characteristic of the prototype of the coin image. In the
                  pre-Iconoclastic period, for example on sarcophagi, the use of haloes to distinguish the figure of Christ was by no means universal, nor does
                  the cross-nimbus become standard until the post-Iconoclastic period. Obviously, what is needed is a really thorough study of the nimbus, from
                  its imperial usages through those of the formative Christian periods. In the meantime, an interesting discussion is contained in the article

                  1940, pp. 214-23. He has also been supported in an article by <persName>K. A. Karabias Gribas</persName>, "Remarks on the narthex mosaics
                  of <persName>Hagia Sophia</persName>," (in Greek) Orthodoxia XV, 1940, pp. 217-26 &amp; 256-9. This is also the identification followed

               <p>The identification of the emperor with Basil I, which has been considered with renewed seriousness in recent years, was strongly advanced by

And if Grabar suggests seriously, <hi rend="italic">L'iconoclasme</hi>, p. 211, n.
                  3, that there was formerly an image of the Patriarch Photius opposite that of the emperor in this mosaic, this could scarcely be other than

               <p>Prof. <persName corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</persName> has advanced, in correspondence, an interesting suggestion about the two
                  main types of enthroned Christ-figures from the Macedonian coinages, i. e. a "clumsy" figure seen on coins of Basil I (<hi rend="italic">BMC</hi> II, Pl. L, 11–12), <persName corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Pl. LII,
                  1), Romanus I and <persName>Constantine</persName> VII (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>. LII, 6), and Romanus I and <persName>Christopher</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Pl. LIII, 1); as against a more "elegant" one, seen with <persName>Leo</persName>
                  VI (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Pl. LI, 9), <persName>Constantine</persName> VII and Romanus I (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>. LII, 4
                  &amp; 5), and on other unpublished specimens of the same reigns: that these two principal types may in fact be linked, one with the
                  Chrysotriclinium mosaic so identified with Basil I, and the other with the tympanum mosaic of <persName>Hagia
                  Sophia</persName>—suggesting, perhaps, that <persName>Leo</persName> VI might be the emperor of the latter mosaic, after all! This suggestion
                  raises numerous fascinating hypotheses, none of them germane to the subject of the present work; it is our hope that Prof. <persName corresp="#viaf_34584084">Bellinger</persName> will see fit to work it out in more detail.</p>

            <head>COIN LEGENDS</head>
            <p>In concluding our analysis of the various representations and symbols employed on the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, we need to consider the legends which accompanied these types, since they can frequently illuminate the pictorial
               representations on the coins. We have already seen this in the case of the "Rex Regnantium" inscription, which seems to be directly applicable,
               in its first occurrence, to a specific Christ-image employed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, and hence
               was applied only by transference to his second Christ-type.<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>As regards the legends used on the first and last of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> coin types, on which he (and later his son as well)
               wears the traditional chlamys-covered costume familiar on earlier imperial issues, we have established that the inscriptions also follow general
               usage on both obverse and reverse.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The same cannot be said of the two legends associated with the emperor's appearance in loros-costume, on the reverses of his two Christ-image
               coins: The legends he used with his name on these coins, "Justinianus Servus Christi" and "Justinianus Multos Annos," have no direct prototypes
               in <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> numismatic practice up to this time, just as the coin types with which they are associated are completely
               unprecedented. They are identifiable, however, as acclamations, and as such may be found in the Book of Ceremonies.<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref>
               But to establish the context in which these legends were selected to accompany these particular coin types (or, perhaps more accurately, to
               discover why these legends dictated themselves as the inevitable ones to accompany these types), it will be necessary to delve into the
               background of the phrases themselves.<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="64"/>
            <p>The appelation "Servus Christi" is, of course, but a variant of the troader expression, "servant of God," which may be found in the Old
               Testament, where it was applied particularly to Moses.<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> Subsequently, the Apostles frequently termed themselves the
               "Servants of Christ" in their epistles: we find the formula used by <persName>Paul</persName>,<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref> who once
               included his assistant <persName>Timothy</persName>,<ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> as well as by <persName>James</persName>,<ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref>
               <persName>Peter</persName>,<ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> and <persName>Jude</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref> With this sort
               of precedent, it is not surprising that this expression of humility should have been popular as a term of self-description among all orders of
               the Christian clergy. In addition, the phrase seems to have been a favorite with <persName>Constantine</persName> the Great, according to
               the <hi rend="italic">Vita Constantini,</hi> which quotes him as using it on numerous occasions;<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref> it has been the
               opinion of some modern scholars that <persName>Constantine</persName> was particularly influenced in his choice of this phrase by the Old
               Testament, and the connection of the term with the person of Moses.<ref target="#CH5-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>As an expression of humility, the phrase continued to enjoy great popularity in the West, largely under the influence of St. Augustine, who
               admonished the mighty of this world to remember their human frailty.<ref target="#CH5-n13">13</ref> The title was used by <persName>Pope
                  Hilarus</persName> (461–8),<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> and an interesting variant survives in which <persName>Pope</persName>
               <persName corresp="#Q956579">John VII</persName> (705–7) declares himself to be the servant of the mother of God.<ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref> It was in the same spirit that <persName>Pope Gregory</persName> I, at the beginning of the seventh century, adopted for
               himself the title "servus servorum Dei,"<ref target="#CH5-n16">16</ref> which has enjoyed <pb n="65"/> almost chief place among all these
               epithets ever since in the favor of all ranks of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.<ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref> The same tradition was present in
               the ruling class of the laity in the West even before Carolingian times,<ref target="#CH5-n18">18</ref> and continued in use throughout the
               middle ages; a particularly interesting occurrence was the assumption by the Holy <placeName>Roman</placeName> Emperor Otto III of the title
               "Servus <persName>Jesu Christi</persName> et Romanorum imperator augustus secundum voluntatem Dei salva-torisque nostrique liberatoris" in
               998 A. D. when he was beginning a campaign against the heathen <persName>Slavs</persName> of Poland.<ref target="#CH5-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the Eastern <placeName>Roman</placeName> Empire, on the other hand, where the position of the imperial authority in relation to the church
               was somewhat different, the title in its various forms, although not unknown among the less exalted,<ref target="#CH5-n20">20</ref> was never
               common in the imperial titulature at any time, and seems to be unprecedented before its use on <persName>Justinian II's</persName> coins. In
               its Greek form, it was employed on coins by the last Iconoclast emperor, <persName>Theophilus</persName>,<ref target="#CH5-n21">21</ref>
               while <persName>Theodore</persName> the Studite applied the contrary epithet "Slave of Satan" to the Iconoclast Emperor <persName>Leo</persName> V.<ref target="#CH5-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>How, then, are we to explain the use of this phrase at precisely this time? It has been suggested that its introduction in the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coinage came about, not from Christian precedent at all, but from the <pb n="66"/> Moslems;<ref target="#CH5-n23">23</ref>
               it is pointed out that on some Moslem coins of about this time, it is customary for the Caliph to call himself "Slave of Allah."<ref target="#CH5-n24">24</ref> These are, of course, the Arab coins based upon models of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName> and <persName>Constans II</persName>, commonly called <placeName>Arab-Byzantine</placeName>, about which we shall have more to say in the next chapter.<ref target="#CH5-n25">25</ref> The fact is that the title
               "Slave of God" had been one of the attributes of the caliphs since the death of <persName>Mohammed</persName>; it occurs in an inscription
               of Moawiyah, dated to A. H. 58, or 677–8 A. D.<ref target="#CH5-n26">26</ref> Its origin is Koranic, for <persName>Mohammed</persName>
               refers to himself as the Slave of God.<ref target="#CH5-n27">27</ref> At another point in the Koran, interestingly enough, in telling the
               apocryphal story of the birth of Jesus, the narrator says that the infant Christ cried out, "I am the servant of God!"<ref target="#CH5-n28">28</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Further investigation, however, reveals that the expression was still more common in Arab usage. The Arabic word for "Slave of God" is Abdullah;
               this is easily recognizable as one of the most common of Moslem given names, as was already the case by the time of Abd el-Malik.<ref target="#CH5-n29">29</ref> Similar "slave-of" names, moreover, were in use in pre-Koranic times, so that <persName>Mohammed's</persName>
               practice is really a continuation of a long-established Arab tradition, rather than an innovation of great immediate significance; the antagonist
               of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, the Caliph Abd el-Malik, had a name which meant "Slave of the King,"
               without application to any specific ruler, mundane or celestial, being implied. There were Abd-el-other names, especially of the pagan gods of
                  <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, such as Abd el-Ilah.<ref target="#CH5-n30">30</ref> So common was this type of terminology, that it seems
               rather unlikely that its use on an extremely limited <pb n="67"/> series of coins, of almost exclusively local circulation, would have been even
               noticed at the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> court, much less imitated on the imperial coinage.<ref target="#CH5-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This question of the relationship between the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> and the Moslem coinages is only a part of the larger problem of
               possible numismatic influences between the two world powers, which we propose to examine, however tentatively, in the following chapter; in the
               meantime, it should not appear too much like anticipating our conclusions to indicate that, if chronology is any guide, there is very little
               likelihood that the coins of Type II on which the "Servus Christi" legend was used were issued as a reply to any action of the Moslems, or were
               dependent in any way upon Moslem influence within Byzantium; in the circumstances, it is far more probable that the inspiration for the legend,
               as well as for the iconography, is to be found within the purely Christian tradition of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> state, than as a
               consequence of foreign and completely alien developments. An imperial tradition for the use of the term "servus Christi" did exist, if only in
               the usage of <persName>Constantine</persName> the Great; and it is to such a precedent that we would expect <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> to have turned, rather than to that of his contemporary rival, the Moslem Caliph Abd
               el-Malik.</p>
            <p>The acclamation "Multos Annos" is by no means as rare in the imperial tradition as is the phrase "servus Christi." Acclamations for longevity,
               including this one, had an important part in the imperial ritual as far back as the first century A. D.;<ref target="#CH5-n32">32</ref> nor were
               they by any means new at that time, having a long history of Hellenistic usage behind them. In the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> epoch, the
               Latin phrase "Multos Annos" was translated into its Greek equivalent πολλοὶ χρóνοι, in which form it recurs throughout the Book of Ceremonies;
               but in its archaic Latin form, quaintly graecisized into οἱ μουλτούσανοι, it was preserved in the special ceremonials of the great festivals of
               the Christian year,<ref target="#CH5-n33">33</ref> as well as among the Latin acclamations chanted by the Chancellors of the Quaestor at
                  Christmas.<ref target="#CH5-n34">34</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="68"/>
            <p>There is still another and particularly interesting use of the acclamation, heard in a series of acclamations and responses chanted on various
               occasions to the emperor or emperors: it was heard at Christmas,<ref target="#CH5-n35">35</ref> at the imperial coronation,<ref target="#CH5-n36">36</ref> on the eve of a great reception,<ref target="#CH5-n37">37</ref> and on a variety of occasions in the <placeName>Hippodrome</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n38">38</ref> This acclamation, which was delivered in verse form, reads in part as follows:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>πολλοὶ ὺμῖν χρóνοι</l>
               <l>οἱ θεράποντες τοῦ χυρὶου.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>It thus combines, in one expression, the words of both the legends we have been examining!</p>

            <head>JUSTINIAN II AND THE MOSLEM REFORM</head>
            <p>As we have just noticed, the suggestion has been made that the design, and particularly the inscriptions, of the new coin types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> were created under the influence of the contemporary coinage of the Moslem
               Caliphate. This theory is only one aspect of a more general thesis that the entire motivation behind <persName>Justinian II's</persName>
               creating a new coinage was the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> reaction to the reform of Moslem official procedures instituted by Abd
               el-Malik during the first reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>.</p>
            <p>The hypothesis that the Moslem reformed coinage met with opposition, and hence reaction, by the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> imperial
               authorities finds support in the account given by <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q319403">Theophanes</persName> of the quarrels leading up to
               the battle of <placeName>Sebastopolis</placeName> in 692,<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> among which he cites side-by-side with Abd el-Malik's
               objections to the deportation of the populace of Cyprus to the mainland, <persName>Justinian II's</persName> refusal to accept gold coins
               struck by the Moslems in payment of the tribute owing to him.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> Neither of our other major sources, however, offers
               this as a cause for the war: <persName corresp="#nomisma_nikephorus">Nicephorus</persName> imputes the rupture solely to <persName>Justinian's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">hubris</hi>;<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref>
               <persName>Michael Syrus</persName> gives the deportation of the population of Cyprus to the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> mainland as
               its only cause.<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The very fact that it was the Moslems who invaded <placeName>Roman</placeName> territory, rather than the other way round, would indicate that
               it was the former who felt themselves to be the aggrieved party. It is difficult to see how this would have been the case had the only point at
               issue been the question of whether or not <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> would accept their coins in
               payment of the tribute he had exacted from them a few years earlier. If he found their coins unacceptable, and refused the tribute in that form,
               it was scarcely the Arabs' responsibility to force it on him, but rather his problem to compel them to offer it in what he deemed proper form;
               similarly, if the emperor <pb n="70"/> considered it objectionable for the Moslems to strike coins other than imitations of his own types (as
               they had been doing), then it was up to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to stop <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> In short, <persName>Justinian
                  II's</persName> refusal of the Moslem tribute could under no circumstances be construed as a reason for them to attack him. Nor can we see any
               economic or other reason the Moslems might have had to attempt to force their gold money into circulation within the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> Empire. By contrast, not only does the Cyprus affair provide adequate motivation for a Moslem protest, but it explains quite
               comprehensibly the actual sequence of events as they took place.</p>
            <p>But what, then, was this newly-minted money of Abd el-Malik's? <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q319403">Theophanes</persName> appears to be
               alluding, and has been taken to refer, to the Moslem reform coinage, which had its part in the general policy of Islamization begun within the
               Caliphate by that monarch.</p>
            <p>When the Caliphs, upon the total collapse of the Sassanian power, took over the structure as well as the territories of the <placeName>Persian Empire</placeName>, they found themselves so suddenly in command of so enormous an administrative system that it was obviously more
               desirable to permit the old forms and methods of routine government to continue, rather than to attempt a revision of procedures according to
               their own nomadic customs. Even more was this true in the lands they conquered from the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> Empire, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254930">Palestine</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, where Christian scribes and account ants sustained a government whose chiefs could scarcely read or
               write, and certainly could not count.</p>
            <p>Illustrative of this stage in the history of the Moslem state is the story of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q44024">Athanasius</persName> Bar
               Goumay, an Edessan Christian who controlled the administration of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> under the titular
               charge of Abd el-Malik's brother, Abd el-Aziz. <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q44024">Athanasius</persName> grew so wealthy in this work,
               albeit with full honesty of action, that he was able to build or repair many Christian churches in both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>. When he returned home at the end of his
               service, Moslem enemies denounced him to the Caliph for having appropriated all the riches of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> for his own private gain. Abd el-Malik, unperturbed, summoned the Edessan to his presence, and told him that it was not deemed
               suitable for a Christian to be quite so rich. So <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q44024">Athanasius</persName> gave the king money until the
               latter said to stop, and <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q44024">Athanasius</persName> went away still a very wealthy man.<ref target="#CH6-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="71"/>
            <p>At this period, all records were kept in Greek, and all figures recorded in the unwieldy, but workable, Greek numeral system. As regards its
               money, the Caliphate at first made no attempt to disturb the numismatic <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> which had existed in tacit agreement
               between the <placeName>Byzantines</placeName> and the <placeName>Sassanians</placeName>. The former, being in possession of the major
               sources of gold ore known to the ancient world, struck coins of that metal, which passed as bullion far beyond the borders of their Empire;<ref target="#CH6-n6">6</ref> the <placeName>Sassanians</placeName>, on the other hand, struck a far greater volume of silver coins than the
                  <placeName>Byzantines</placeName>, while their gold coinage was issued in token quantity.</p>
            <p>Until eighty years after the Hegira, the Caliphs continued to strike silver coins which were copied with the utmost fidelity from the <placeName>Sassanian</placeName> types, to which were added marginal inscriptions in Arabic giving religious formulae as well as the names of
               issuing governors, etc.<ref target="#CH6-n7">7</ref> In gold and bronze, the Caliphate seems to have begun coining somewhat later, and then in
               imitation of the <placeName>Byzantines</placeName>, especially the types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>
               and of <persName>Constans II</persName>.<ref target="#CH6-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It was Abd el-Malik, however, who took the initiative to alter this state of affairs, and, more particularly, to weaken the hold of the
               Christians upon the rank and file of his administration. In 81 A. H. (700 A. D.) he took serious steps to see that all state records should be
               kept in Arabic, instead of Greek;<ref target="#CH6-n9">9</ref> but even before this he had begun the process by the introduction of a totally
               new, "iconoclastic" coinage, in both gold and silver. These coins renounced the stylized <pb n="72"/> symbols, the ruler-images, modified crosses
               and fire-altars, which had characterized the Moslem coinage until then; instead, they bore merely the Arabic inscriptions of identification, and
               pious expressions, arranged in conformity with the shape of the coin.</p>
            <p>As late as 84 A. H. (703 A. D.), <placeName>Arab-Sassanian</placeName> coins were still being struck;<ref target="#CH6-n10">10</ref> but the
               beginning of the new coinage dates nevertheless from several years earlier. The literary information in the Arab chronicles which has a bearing
               on this problem has been assembled with a view to giving us a general picture of the Reform itself, so that we can arrive at some general
               consensus of the opinions of the sources.<ref target="#CH6-n11">11</ref> Of the seven Arab historians who refer to the Reform, two date it in 74
               A. H. (693–4 A. D.); two date it in 75 A. H.; and three in yet the following year.</p>
            <p>What is especially clear from all these texts is the fact that the history of the Reform was indissolubly linked with the career of el-Hajjaj
               ibn-Yusuf, Abd el-Malik's great schoolmaster-tumed-general, who was the one person most responsible for the triumph of the <placeName>Umayyad</placeName> cause over its opponents in the contest for the Caliphate between the years 685 and 695 A. D.</p>
            <p>In 692, Hajjaj was at last victorious over Abdullah ibn-az-Zubeir, who had hitherto held Mecca and the Hejaz against the <placeName>Umayyad</placeName> party. Two years were then spent by Hajjaj in repairing the damage wrought by civil war (he had not hesitated to bombard the
               Holy City itself during his siege, and even the sacred Kaaba had been gravely damaged). It was only in the year 75 A. H. that he was appointed
               governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</placeName>, where his talents were required to deal with the turbulent spirits of the
               citizens of the city of Kufa, in an area where the Shiite partisans of Ali were still numerous.<ref target="#CH6-n12">12</ref> It is clear from
               the chroniclers that it was only after Hajjaj had taken command in <placeName corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</placeName> that the Reform
               coinage was instituted; this being the case, the effective date of the Reform must be placed, at the earliest, in 695 A. D., or 75 A. H.<ref target="#CH6-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We have no more reliable evidence, of course, than that provided by the dated Moslem coins themselves; and this evidence does not <pb n="73"/>
               contradict the information given by the chronicles. The first indisputable and wholly reformed dinar (gold piece) appears at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</placeName>, dated 77 A. H.;<ref target="#CH6-n14">14</ref> the earliest known reformed dirhem (silver) is
               dated two years later.<ref target="#CH6-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This chronological information makes it reasonably certain that the Moslem Reform coinage cannot have been a factor contributing to the rupture
               of <placeName>Arab-Byzantine</placeName> relations which took place in 691 A. D., and to the battle of <placeName>Sebastopolis</placeName>
               in 692, at a time when our sources specifically state that Hajjaj was still conducting his campaign in the Hejaz. The date of the battle is
               placed in the latter year, and the rupture of relations in the former, by <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q319403">Theophanes</persName>, whose
               chronology at this period is fixed with admirable precision by his mention of a solar eclipse only two years later. This was the eclipse of A. M.
               6186, which took place at the third hour on Sunday, the fifth of October (Hyperberetaios according to <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q319403">Theophanes</persName>, a Macedonian month-name rarely used in <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> writings).<ref target="#CH6-n16">16</ref> This corresponds exactly with the empirical eclipse-tables set up by modern mathematical computation, according to
               which an eclipse occurred on a date corresponding to October fifth, a Sunday, in 693 A. D.<ref target="#CH6-n17">17</ref> A chart of the path of
               totality, moreover, shows that the eclipse reached maximum at <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> (it was not total there, but to the south,
               in a path across <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, the Hellespont, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> including <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonika</placeName>, and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</placeName>) between 8:30 and 9:00 a. m., a time corresponding closely to the "third hour."<ref target="#CH6-n18">18</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the circumstances, it is equally improbable that the Moslem Reform coinage could have had, <hi rend="italic">per se,</hi> any direct influence
               upon the issue of new coins such as Types II and III by <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>. Coins of these
               types, although not so numerous as those of Type I, the other type attributed to his first reign, are still sufficiently common to indicate that
               they must have been issued well before the very end of that reign; yet the Moslem Reform was begun so very shortly before his downfall in 695, if
               it preceded that event at all, that it would be difficult indeed to imagine how so complex a procedure of invention <pb n="74"/> and execution
               could have been carried through during the period of a few short months which is all we may allow for the creation of these wholly original
               designs.</p>
            <p>One other possibility of a way in which Moslem coins might have provoked a <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> reaction remains to be considered:
               this is the possible influence of Moslem coins which were not the actual reformed dinars, but Abd el-Malik's previous tentative issues of gold in
               free imitation of earlier <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> types.<ref target="#CH6-n19">19</ref> Although the earliest dated example of this
               sort of Arab gold coin was struck only in 74 A. H. (693–4 A. D.),<ref target="#CH6-n20">20</ref> it is generally accepted that certain of the
               undated issues, and particularly the type with three standing figures, modelled on the coins of the latter part of the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>,<ref target="#CH6-n21">21</ref> are of a slightly earlier date. Similarly, in the
               silver, various experiments toward the development of new types seem to have been made just before the actual Reform itself, with two specimens
               dating from the year 75 A. H. having been noted.<ref target="#CH6-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The principal argument against this thesis is the extreme scarcity of examples of this coinage, as well as the wide variety of types found among
               the relatively few surviving specimens.<ref target="#CH6-n23">23</ref> This was plainly a <pb n="75"/> small, token coinage, minted only for
               local circulation, which would scarcely have figured in international financial transactions in any important way; as the <placeName>Byzantines</placeName> had tolerated the <placeName>Sassanians'</placeName> striking such limited series of gold coins, they had no more reason
               to object to the Moslems doing the same. Nor have any specimens of this type of coin been found in contemporary <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coin hoards, as Reform coins have.<ref target="#CH6-n24">24</ref> The crude modifications of the original types and legends,
               and the addition of a limited number of Moslem religious expressions, seem scarcely enough provocation for either a war or a
               numismatic-iconographic revolution, even had these pieces reached <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> in any large quantity, as it is highly
               doubtful that they did.</p>
            <p>The most reasonable conclusion open to us is to eliminate the Arab coins as a factor in the struggle between <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> and Abd el-Ma-lik, especially since a fully satisfactory and more logical <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> exists in the Cyprus incident. If it be objected that <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q319403">Theophanes</persName>' statement is too unequivocal to be wholly disregarded (although there is little about his accuracy of detail, particularly
               at this murky period, to merit such unalloyed confidence), we may suggest that possibly coins were concerned with the outbreak of hostilities,
               but that Theo-phanes had gotten things turned round: the Arabs were objecting to <persName>Justinian II's</persName> new coins bearing
               Christ-types, rather than the other way round. In any case, we are obliged to conclude that in order to find the stimulus which produced the new
               coin types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, we must look elsewhere.<ref target="#CH6-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="76"/>
            <p>Before we do so, however, we must make one further remark. Now that we have established a rough date for the institution of the Moslem Reform
               coinage, and have tentatively assumed the priority of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> new coins over that Reform, it is tempting to ask
               whether the opposite influence might not have been operative: whether, that is, Abd el-Malik's iconoclastic measures might not have been at least
               accelerated, though not necessarily <hi rend="italic">au fond</hi> caused, by the appearance of these coins bearing the portrait of Christ, which
               it would have been repugnant, at the very least, for a faithful Moslem to use?</p>
            <p>There are one or two passages in the Arab historians, as a matter of fact, which might, freely interpreted, give credence to this view. One is in
               al-Baladhuri, describing how the <placeName>Byzantines</placeName> bought papyrus from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> with their gold money.<ref target="#CH6-n26">26</ref> According to this oft-repeated story, Abd el-Malik introduced the practice
               of using pious Moslem phrases in the protocols which were inscribed on these papyri to guarantee their authenticity; the king of the Romans
               objected to this, and demanded that it be stopped, or else he would place insulting mention of the Moslems' prophet on the coins. And so Abd
               el-Malik made his own coins instead. In some ways, this sounds more like a <hi rend="italic">post facto</hi> rationalization of the course of
               events, than an accurate description of the way things happened at the time; but the idea that Abd el-Malik initiated his new coins as a result
               of the appearance of <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> gold bearing an image unacceptable to the faithful Moslem, is a persuasive one.</p>
            <p>Another document, cited at second hand, ascribes to one Picendi, Coptic bishop of Keft, a description of the Arabs taking the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> gold coins which bore the Cross and the image of Christ, effacing this figure and symbol, and writing instead the name of
               their prophet and of their caliph.<ref target="#CH6-n27">27</ref> There can be little doubt that a good deal of the Moslem gold coinage–if not
               almost all of it–was produced by melting down or restriking <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> issues, as the lower weight standard of the dinar
               in relation to the solidus suggests.</p>
            <pb n="77"/>
            <p>The non-Arabist can only raise a question of this sort; but the problem clearly merits more thorough examination, in terms of the evidence on the
               Islamic side, than it has yet received.<ref target="#CH6-n28">28</ref>

                  in both directions, while there was ample justification for the steps taken in the native tradition of each side.</p>

               portraits of Christ onto his coins, there is another sort of event from that same period to which these numismatic innovations may be linked.
               This was pointed out two decades ago by <persName>Grabar</persName>, who wrote, "Un concile qu'un empereur avait réuni en 692, dans son
               palais, s'était montré hostile é la doctrine romaine et, en matiére d'art, avait ordonné la représentation obliga-toire du Christ, sous ses
               traits physiques; Fempereur qui avait pris Tinitiative de ce concile, se déclarant <hi rend="italic">servus Christi</hi>, s'empressa de suivre le
               nouveau canon, et fit graver sur ses monnaies cette icone de Jésus que nous venons de signaler."<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The council referred to was of course the Quinisexte, which in one of its canons concerned itself specifically with the representation of Christ,
               and which thus seemed to <persName>Grabar</persName> as well as to most other students of the subject of pre-Iconoclastic icon-worship<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> directly related to the numismatic innovations with which we are dealing. Hitherto we have referred to this council
               only briefly, as the cause of a rupture between <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref> Now let us examine it more closely, in order to see not only the specific phrases which concern us
               most directly, but the general character of the council as a whole, with a view to understanding both the basis of disagreement with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, and the background of our own particular problem.<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The text of the Canons of the Quinisexte Council is given in full in <persName>Mansi</persName>,<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> and is
               summarized, with a certain amount of commentary, in <persName>Hefele-Leclercq</persName>.<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref> The Canons give us,
               in terms of the conditions <pb n="79"/> they were intended to correct, a closely-observed though one-sided picture of the life of Byzantium at
               the end of the seventh century, a time when priests might take part in theatrical performances, cheer on the Blues or the Greens in the <placeName>Hippodrome</placeName>, or even keep houses of ill fame; when monks did not wish to be confined to their cloisters, but wandered into
               the cities and towns, acting not only as preachers but even as merchants or conjurors; where the laymen of the city consulted all manner of
               soothsayers and astrologers, and the countrymen retained many of their old pagan beliefs and practices when they bore upon the daily relationship
               to the natural world upon which their livelihood depended.</p>
            <p>What these disciplinary Canons reflect, however, is not truly a world of frivolity, but a profoundly disturbed and dislocated one, when a great
               empire was in the act of dissolving into its component parts, tom by dissension within and pressed by enemies without who were not just the
               unlettered barbarians of earlier times, but civilized adherents of ways of life and thought which represented a far more serious threat to the
               continuity of <persName>Greco-Roman</persName> Christian culture than mere barbarism could ever have meant.</p>
            <p>Such were the circumstances under which <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> summoned his Quinisexte Council,
               wishing to make up for the fact that no general church council had taken up the new problems of ecclesiastic and lay discipline for over two
               centuries.</p>
            <p>The Canons of this Council, then, had two principal objectives: the regularization of all Christian practices throughout the Oecumene, and the
               eradication of any non-orthodox elements in Christian worship which might tend to endanger the purity of the Faith. Basic questions of theology
               were not considered; the Quinisexte Council, which was regarded at the time and afterward as a simple continuation of the sittings of the Sixth
               Council, rested upon the theological decisions and definitions of that and the preceding oecumenical councils. The Canons of the Quinisexte
               Council represented what their authors regarded as logical extensions of these definitions into the everyday practice of the Christian
               faithful.</p>
            <p>The largest single group of these Canons is, therefore, related directly to discipline within the Church itself. The purpose of these acts was,
               more or less by definition, to provide for the raising of ethical and moral standards within the body ecclesiastic. In such a council <pb n="80"/> as the Quinisexte, claiming oecumenical status, there was also the necessity of arriving at a universal standard in each case, which should be
               valid for the entire Christian community.</p>
            <p>This community, the Oecumene, properly speaking embraces all individuals worshipping Christ; it is a concept of great flexibility, and powerful
               in its very variety and looseness of definition. The weakness of the Quinisexte Canons lay in their attempt to impose too rigid a pattern upon an
               oecumene whose structure had become far too complex to admit of such an imposition.<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref> The action of the Quinisexte
               Council was no less worthy for being ill-advised, however; its aim was to provide, in such matters as ecclesiastical administration, marriage
               regulations for the clergy, enforcement of monastic vows, and so forth, an adequate standard of behavior which would enhance the moral character
               of all the clergy. Its success in this effort, within its own sphere, is demonstrated by the fact that virtually all its provisions of more than
               purely temporary significance remain in effect throughout the Eastern Church to this day.</p>
            <p>Similarly, another group of Canons concerned itself with the moral behavior of the laity, with a view toward eradicating both the surviving
               influences of paganism, and those of the contemporary coreligion, Judaism,<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> as well as correcting the general moral
               laxity which had been brought about by over a century of political unrest.</p>
            <p>The most pertinent Canons for us, however, are those, less than one third of the whole, which relate to matters of worship and ritual, some of
               which may be connected directly to the Christological thought of the period.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref> The result of the Christological
               controversies, with their demonstration that the crux of orthodoxy lay in its adherence to the dogma of the Incarnation, had been to place
               increasing stress upon the importance of the ritual of worship, in which the Mass and its related sacraments were the living enactment of the
               Incarnation of Christ. We find, therefore, that a large body of the Canons are concerned <pb n="81"/> with regularizing the performance of the
               church rituals; enhancing their sanctity through the prohibition of practices common at earlier times, which tended to diminish the exclusiveness
               of the ceremonial as performed by the ordained clergy; regulating the observance of feasts and fasts; and in other ways emphasizing the new
               importance of church ritual, as a prerogative of the church hierarchy, the instrument of salvation for the Oecumene.</p>
            <p>The purpose of all this legislation, plainly enough, was to ensure that the liturgy of the Church would be performed in one way and only one, and
               only by certain people, so that its meaning, particularly with reference to the Incarnation of Christ, in Both Natures and Both Wills, should
               never be obscured. Therefore the ceremonial of the Mass must never be confused by extra offerings, nor should its significance be obscured by
               rich trappings added by communicants, who think to honor the Body of the Lord, but instead dishonor Him with gifts of base dead matter.</p>
            <p>Because of this, the Quinisexte Council, although the direct sequel of the Fifth and Sixth Councils, finds itself more closely allied to the
               theological discussions of the Middle Ages, between and within both the Eastern and the Western Churches, when practice and ritual became more
               and more the subject, instead of the abstract conceptions of the nature of divinity which had been the concern of the first church councils.</p>
            <p>It is among these Canons which have to do with the regulation of worship that we may find the two which particularly concern the present study.
               The first of these is Canon 73, the text of which is as follows: "Since the lifegiving cross has shown us the way to salvation, we ought to apply
               every care to give the proper honor to that through which we have been saved from the ancient fall. Wherefore, bestowing upon it reverence in
               mind, speech and sensation, we order that the signs of the cross made by some people on the ground should utterly disappear, lest the victorious
               trophy be insulted by trampling underfoot. Therefore we decree that henceforward those who make the sign of the cross on the ground should be
                  excommunicated."<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="82"/>
            <p>On the one hand, this interesting regulation, forbidding a practice virtually unknown in the West, may take its place in the historical
               crystallization of religious symbolism in the Christian world. From a general symbol of the Faith, referring sometimes to the event of the
               crucifixion, sometimes to the person of Christ Himself, and just as often taken as an almost abstract decorative motif which merely indicated a
               subject that was Christian in nature, the Holy Cross comes to be understood in one single guise: that of the instrument "through which we have
               been saved from the ancient fall." As such, it must not be desecrated by the feet of the faithful as they come to worship.</p>
            <p>The emphatic reiteration of this Canon at precisely this time, on the other hand, cannot but be in some way the consequence of the decisions of
               the general councils, as well as of the accelerating advance of icon-worship which the seventh century had seen.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref>
               In the sense that it was the instrument of salvation itself, its sanctity, like that of the Virgin Mary, is an integral tenet of the orthodox
               faith, an element apt to be depreciated by either extreme of heresy, Nestorianism or Monophysitism, and their manifold offshoots: whether one
               believes in the complete unity of the person of Christ, or in His having two wholly distinct persons, the role of the Virgin as the Mother of
               God, and that of the Cross as the Instrument of Redemption (the two primary aspects of the Incarnation are after all Christ's Birth and Re-Birth)
               become less important. For in either case the divine nature of Christ (whether embracing all of Him, or but one distinct Nature) is not concerned
               with these instruments: He passes through the Virgin "like water through a pipe" (Nestorian); only an "image" of Him hangs upon the Cross
               (Monophysite). So, while participation in either extreme of heresy will lead the individual to depreciate the instruments of the Incarnation,
               orthodoxy, by contrast, will always tend to exalt them.</p>
            <p>It is for this reason that the Quinisexte Council was impelled to particularize finally the nature of the approved representation of the <pb n="83"/> Cross, and to specify that it must receive, and be so placed as always to receive, the reverence due it as one of these
               instruments.</p>
            <p>Canon 82 of the Quinisexte Council seems to us almost a corollary of Canon 73, but it is far more important to the history of Christian art:</p>
            <p>"On some representations of venerable icons is depicted a lamb pointed at by the Forerunner's finger, which has been accepted as a symbol of
               Grace, showing us in advance through the Law the true Lamb, Christ our Lord. While embracing the ancient symbols and shadows as signs and
               anticipatory tracings of the Truth handed down to the Church, we give preference to the Grace and the Truth, having received them as the
               fulfilment of the Law. Therefore, in order that the perfect should be set down before everybody's eyes on paintings also, we decree that the
               [figure] of the Lamb, Christ our God, who removes the sins of the world, should henceforward be set up<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref> in human
               form in images also, instead of the ancient lamb, comprehending through Him the height of the humiliation of God's Word, and guided towards the
               recollection of His Incarnation, His Passion, and His Salutary Death, and the redemption which has thence accrued to the world."<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="84"/>
            <p>This pronouncement is of the greatest significance; it is the official sentence passed upon the symbolic representation of Christ, as it had been
               inherited from primitive Christian art; and sentence passed for the very reason that evolving orthodoxy, with its dogma of the Incarnation, could
               no longer tolerate purely symbolic representation. The Canon refers specifically to the image of the Lamb, which is here forbidden, but its
               effect is to forbid the use of any symbolic representation whatsoever of the living incarnate Christ. This sense is reinforced by Canon 73,
               dealing with the use of the Holy Cross in art and decoration. The Cross had been used as a symbol for Christ Himself from early times, but in
               speaking of its use, the Council makes it very plain that it is referring in no way to a symbol for the Crucified, but to the Cross itself, that
               is to say, to an Instrument of the Passion, which is to be represented as such.<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> The principle established by these
               Canons, then, is that, in Christian art, an object represented should stand for only one thing, that which it directly represents.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the case of the Lamb-image, this principle is based upon the fact that the use of this symbol to represent Christ derives from the old
               dispensation of the Law, that of the Old Testament, and hence is no longer applicable in the present dispensation of Grace, inaugurated <pb n="85"/> by the Incarnation and set forth in the New Testament.<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref> The point involved is not one of sacrilege, as
               in the case of the use of the Cross in pavements, but rather the simple matter of clarity and precision– the object of all the Canons dealing
               with matters of worship, as we have pointed out. As the council saw it, in a religious picture, a personality represented was understood to be
               "present" in the form in which he or she walked the earth, not in the form of a symbol or allusive reference.<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The position of religious art in the drama of worship, therefore, is clearly thought out and presented in the acts of the Quinisexte Council, as
               the product of previous decisions and definitions of the Church Universal. Just as the Council of Chalcedon had its immediate repercussions in
                  art,<ref target="#CH7-n18">18</ref> so our Canon 82 may be understood to be the logical consequence of the anti-Monothelete definition of the
               Sixth Council. This Council had the problem of undoing the linking of the divine and human wills of Christ, accomplished by the Monothelete
               definitions, which it did by reference to the identity of His human flesh, which was not destroyed by being deified, and yet did continue to
               exist as divine and human both. So the human appearance of Christ assumes a new importance in relation to His Godhead as well as His
                  humanity.<ref target="#CH7-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>His personality is expressed in the action of His two united wills, just as His physical aspect manifests itself in the union of His two persons.
               The definition of Chalcedon, followed by the definition of the Sixth Council, imposed the necessity of representing Christ as one person, divine
               and human simultaneously, manifesting the unity of His two wills, in the form which made His Incarnation visible to men, i.e., in human form as
               He had walked the earth. Only by representing Christ directly in this way could the orthodox dogma be illustrated; the ancient symbols could no
               longer serve to inculcate the presence of the God-man Who had been on earth, and is in heaven.</p>
            <p>We cannot exaggerate the importance of this Eighty-Second Canon to its own time; it states the problem of Christian religious representation <pb n="86"/> in terms of Christology, and it was on the grounds of Christology that the Iconoclastic Controversy was fought in the course of the
               next century and a half.<ref target="#CH7-n20">20</ref> This Canon was remembered well, and it became an important weapon for the orthodox cause
               in the eighth century. Not only was it cited in the works of the orthodox polemicists like the <persName>Patriarch Nicephorus</persName>
               <ref target="#CH7-n21">21</ref> and others,<ref target="#CH7-n22">22</ref> but it was actually used in the proceedings of the Seventh Oecumenical
               Council, in 787.<ref target="#CH7-n23">23</ref> It was, in fact, the chief legal precedent available for use by the orthodox party in demanding a
               general council on the subject of Iconoclasm, and as such it was the principal text, aside from biblical and patristic references, used by the
               Patriarch Tarasius in his inaugural <hi rend="italic">synodica</hi> to the Eastern Patriarchs, calling for that Council.<ref target="#CH7-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These are the facts which led <persName>Grabar</persName> to see a connection between the action of the Quinisexte Council, and the
               initiative taken by the imperial administration in issuing coins bearing the portrait of Christ; this relation seems to us also the most obvious,
               and the most direct one of the possibilities open. Whether or not these coins were produced as the direct outcome of the Council's sessions, or
               were merely struck at about the same time as a result of the same thinking, the same intellectual climate, must remain a moot question, with the
               weight of the probabilities perhaps on the side of the latter conclusion.</p>
            <p>Of the two types showing the image of Christ accompanied by that of the sole emperor (as he was during his first reign), it is our Type II, on
               which the emperor termed himself "Servus Christi," which <persName>Grabar</persName> formerly felt showed most characteristics indicating
               its special connection <pb n="87"/> with Canon 82;<ref target="#CH7-n25">25</ref> we are inclined to the same conclusion. But if that is so, what
               are we to make of the other type, Type III, which also shows the emperor alone, but in bust form, and with a different Christ portrait?</p>
            <p>In seeking an answer to this problem, the evidence of the mints from which the coins were issued is of some value. In summarizing this evidence,
               insofar as it is available to us, we have found that Type II occurs only in issues of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> and of the
               Exarchate of <placeName>Carthage</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>), while Type III is to be found
               not only at these mints, but at two Italian mints, at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and in the South.<ref target="#CH7-n26">26</ref> Equally significant, from this point of view, is the fact that in published records of coin hoards, coins of Type
               II and of Type III have never been found together.<ref target="#CH7-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Arguments <hi rend="italic">ex silentio</hi> are by their nature perilous; yet a check of as many collections and cabinets as possible has
               confirmed the absence of any coins of Type II which might have been struck at Italian mints. This fits so conveniently with our hypothesis about
               the character and meaning of Type II, that it is difficult not to regard this situation as significant. We know that the Acts of the Quinisexte
               Council were never signed by the <persName>Pope</persName>–that, in fact, the first <persName>Pope</persName> to receive them, Sergius,
               refused to permit their publication within his domain.<ref target="#CH7-n28">28</ref>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> attempted to force Sergius to bow to his will, but the <persName>Pope</persName> was too strong on his home ground to be bested by the emperor's first attempt at coercion, and <persName>Justinian's</persName> first reign ended before another attempt could be made. In this quarrel, the Exarch of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> is conspicuous by his absence; he seems to have kept himself aloof from <pb n="88"/> the dispute, for
               motives which we can only surmise. What more natural, therefore, than for him to have hesitated to strike coins identified with the actions of
               the Council, at mints where the papal authority was in effect stronger than his own?</p>
            <p>Coins of our Type III, on the other hand, seem to have been acceptable in the West; and their reverse, in fact, seems to show a different aspect
               of the imperial authority. The globus in the emperor's hand proclaims "Peace;" if this was an offer of reconciliation with <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, it must have been accepted. Could all this have taken place during the same short period of three
               years from 692, the date of the Council, to 695, the date of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> fall?</p>
            <p>The reason that all coins bearing the figure of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> alone have usually been
               assigned to his first reign is the simple one that we know that during his second reign he had as co-emperor his infant son, <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName>. But the fact seems to have escaped the compilers of our catalogues that <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> at the outset of his second reign did rule alone for several months, perhaps for the
               better part of a year, before he was able to bring his wife and son to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> and have them crowned; and during
               part of that period, he was not even aware of his son's existence.<ref target="#CH7-n29">29</ref> In this time, <persName>Justinian</persName> could scarcely have presumed to strike coins representing his uncrowned son as already elevated to the rank of Augustus; yet
               it is equally inconceivable, given the importance of the coin-image as a representation of the imperial authority, that he would have failed to
               strike some sort of coins of his own, to replace in circulation those of his hated—and vanquished—rivals.</p>
            <p>Our Type III fits the requirements of such a type to perfection, in view of what we know of the circumstances of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</persName> Ps return to power. Whereas an attempt to explain its appearance at any earlier date raised
               innumerable complications, in 705 all its distinctive characteristics coincide with the period when the emperor was showing himself willing to
               make concessions to the papal feelings as a price for reconciliation with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and the West:
               among these characteristics we should single out the retreat from the "imperial" Christ-image associated, apparently, with the controversial
               Quinisexte Council; the proclamation of "Peace" restored to earth by <persName>Justinian</persName>, <pb n="89"/> the rightful emperor;<ref target="#CH7-n30">30</ref> and yet at the same time, significantly enough, sufficient attributes are retained, such as the "Rex Regnantium"
               legend and the emperor's loros-costume, to continue to assert the God-given nature of the emperor's power almost as much as the preceding type
               had done.</p>
            <p>Nor would the Papacy have been so apt to block the minting of such coins. Its point had been made in the suppression of Type II; the political
               symbolism of Type III, in contradistinction to that of its predecessor, contains nothing which would have made its striking objectionable at the
               mints under the jurisdiction of the Exarch of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>. Coins of this type, with <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> alone, would have continued to appear, as other periods of multiple-rulership
               demonstrate, even after the coronation of little <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName> had led to the introduction of
               Type IV and Type IV-B.</p>
            <p>There are other grounds on which our objection to the dating of Type III to the first reign have already been substantiated. Examination of our
               descriptions of the two issues will show differences in the orthography of the legends on the two which are highly unlikely on coins minted
               direct sequence: while Type II calls Christ "IHSCRIS-TOS," Type III terms Him "DNIHSCHS;" Type II begins the emperor's title "DIUSTIN...," while
               Type III begins "DNIVS-TIN..."<ref target="#CH7-n31">31</ref> Further differences in the epigraphy of these inscriptions, in each case relating
               Type III closer to Type IV than to its predecessor, as well as the evidence of style, led <persName>Laffranchi</persName> to anticipate our
               conclusions in his important article:<ref target="#CH7-n32">32</ref> He found that whereas Type II followed epigraphically and stylistically upon
                  <persName>Justinian II's</persName> Type I in <pb n="90"/> a natural way, Type III showed considerable dissimilarities stylistically and
               epigraphically (the phrasing of the inscription referring to Christ differs on the two types, for example, as does the epigraphy of the letter
               "G"). In general, on the other hand, the style of Type III is quite similar to that of the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius_iii">Tiberius III</persName> (<ref target="#fig-17">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 15</ref>; the heads, hair, etc., of the emperor-portraits on the two types are all but identical, and
               quite dissimilar from the strongly individualized and far more plastic portraits of the coins of <persName>Leontius</persName> or of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> first reign). <persName>Laffranchi</persName> established a stylistic sequence, therefore, in which
                  <persName>Justinian II's</persName> coins of Type III took a place only following the development carried through by the coins of <persName>Leontius</persName> and of <persName>Tiberius Apsimar</persName>, and hence belonging to the second reign.</p>
            <p>Final confirmation is available with the discovery of two bronzes, bearing the image of the emperor in bust-length and wearing the loros, as on
               the gold of Type III, and with legible dates in the year XXI, which in <persName>Justinian II's</persName> reigns must be 705–6 (<ref target="#fig-16">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, 14</ref>).<ref target="#CH7-n33">33</ref>
            </p>
            <p>With such gratifying substantiating evidence, we may now postulate a chronology for the types of <persName>Justinian II's</persName>
               coinage, always allowing for overlapping and continuation of issues within the reigns beyond the rough boundary dates we have indicated:</p>

               <p>The use of the word ἀναστηλоῦσθαι here has led to a misunderstanding of the Canon on the part of <persName>Dom Leclercq</persName> (<persName>Hefele-Leclercq</persName>, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> III<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, p. 573, n. 3), who, translating it as
                  "erected," states that it indicates in consequence that we are dealing here exclusively with images of the cross, i. e., the Crucifixion. The
                  word, however, is never used in the sense of "raising" the Cross, insofar as we can determine, but applies instead to the "erection" of images
                  themselves; it became the specific term referring to the restoration of the images after the end of the Iconoclasm.</p>
               <p>The error seems to have arisen from the defective text of the original in <persName>Mansi</persName>, wherein the accusative article τòν
                  has no noun (see below). In our translation, we have supplied the noun as "figure" or "image"; <persName>Leclercq</persName>, however,
                  read the clause to the effect that it was "the Lamb, Christ our God" Who was erected (actually a phrase in the genetive), leading him into his
                  mistake.</p>
               <p>This Canon has nothing to do with the specific scene of the crucifixion as such, and had no effect upon the artistic tradition of that scene,
                  except in the general sense that it influenced all subsequent <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> representations of Christ. In any case, as
                  Kitzinger has shown, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit</hi>., the creative powers and theoretical interests of this period were directed not toward
                  the narrative side of Christian art, but toward the more purely iconic.</p>

                  Quinisexte Canon, and hence most directly issued in consequence of the Council's action. While our findings about the relations and meaning of
                  the Christ-type (cf. below) are close to those of <persName>Grabar</persName>, this analogy with the "Lamb of God" concept seems to us
                  unnecessarily rigid. More conclusively, we believe that the chronology of the types precludes the possibility that coins of Type III were

               <p>The use of the legend "PAX" is curiously restricted on <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> coins—curiously so considering its wide currency
                  during the Roman Empire. It appears, other than on these issues, on the earlier bronze issues of Justinian II (n. 6, p. 21, above) and on a

            <head>THE MEANING OF <persName>JUSTINIAN II'S</persName> NEW COIN TYPES</head>
            <p>In our study of the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, which gradually has narrowed consideration
               to Types II and III as representing the significant innovations of this emperor in numismatic iconography, we have been led step by step to the
               statement of most of the conclusions which it is possible to draw from them. In the course of this study, we have been able to indicate in detail
               many of the determinations which may be made with assurance as to the precise meaning of the coins– insofar as, at the time of issue even, one
               would have been correct in attributing to each a single meaning, whether precise or otherwise. It remains for us, however, to gather this
               somewhat scattered evidence together in view of our larger problems.</p>
            <p>In doing so, we should keep in mind the significant point emphasized by <persName>Grabar</persName>, that on both of these coin issues it is
               necessary, more than with almost any others in the field of numismatics, to consider both obverse and reverse types together, as complementary
               images forming one iconographic whole.<ref target="#CH8-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The reverse of Type II (<ref target="#fig-7">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 5</ref>), representing the standing emperor holding the stepped cross, takes its point of departure, as we
               have indicated, from the symbolism of the imperial victory; the consular costume serves to carry out this symbolism still more clearly. Yet the
               legend, as <persName>Grabar</persName> remarked,<ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref> does not really complement this iconography; instead, it
               employs an expression of humility to show the emperor as the subject of Christ.<ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref> We have before us, then, a subtle
               transition from the previous iconography, in which Christian symbols were the instruments of the imperial power in achieving an essentially
               secular triumph, to a new conception, in which the emperor himself is but the instrument of the Divine Will in achieving Its own victories.</p>
            <pb n="92"/>
            <p>Our research on the background of the "servus Christi" legend has shown that its determining formative element was that of the apostolic
               tradition. That this is the connotation of our type as a whole may be suggested by the chapter of the Book of Ceremonies referred to earlier,
               which explains why the emperor and the twelve high dignitaries wore the loros on Easter Sunday: The magistrates do so as types of the Apostles,
               says the text, while the emperor in his golden costume represents, insofar as it is possible for a mere human being to do so, <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> Himself!<ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This Christomimesis was thus a conscious element of the mid-<placeName>Byzantine</placeName> imperial ceremonial; are we justified in
               projecting its origins back to the seventh century? Quite possibly not, as far as an overt intention is concerned; yet the study of our coin
               types makes it all but indisputable that these were ideas present at that time: the emperor, standing before his Master, appears to men both as
               the image of the Divine Pambasileus on earth,<ref target="#CH8-n5">5</ref> and as the apostle of the true Faith, of orthodoxy itself, bearing the
               true word of dogma to all men.</p>
            <p>If this coin type represents the emperor, therefore, as a living apostle, how would the function of his apostleship have been conceived by these
               men of the seventh century?</p>
            <p>Three hundred years later, when the Holy <placeName>Roman</placeName> Emperor Otto III employed the same titulature, it was on the occasion of
               a campaign in Poland, against a heathen people.<ref target="#CH8-n6">6</ref> Otto found it expedient to propagandize his war as a crusade of
               evangelism against the pagans, so that he used the title "servus Christi" to suggest his campaign's missionary, hence apostolic, nature. <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> also engaged in a war against the barbarians, in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</placeName> in 688, and it has been <pb n="93"/> suggested<ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref> that this "apostolic"
               coin type might well refer to this campaign. The muted triumphal symbolism of the type might be understood to favor this interpretation; yet it
               must be considered doubtful either that the campaign of 688 assumed sufficient importance to justify such a radical innovation in numismatic
               iconography, or that the mission of the campaign was conceived, even for purposes of propaganda, as being of an evangelical nature. There are no
               signs that the <placeName>Byzantines</placeName> of this period ever sought to justify their periodic raids against the <persName>Slavs</persName> and the <persName>Bulgars</persName> on the grounds that they were bringing light to the heathen; on the contrary, these
               were purely defensive excursions, and until the ninth century little or no effort seems to have been expended in the direction of effecting the
               conversion of these enemies to Christianity.<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Much more directly connected with the apostolic function in the attitude of the day, on the other hand, was the idea of establishing orthodoxy
               within the Christian community itself. <persName>Constantine</persName>, first of the imperial apostles,<ref target="#CH8-n9">9</ref>
               appears to have had this very much in mind when he assembled the first oecumenical council to define the orthodox faith, for in his preamble to
               the Council of Nicaea, reported in several sources, the emperor addressed the assembled bishops as the servants of God, nominating himself as
               their fellow-slave, and called upon them all to be apostles of peace within the Christian community by their actions at that council.<ref target="#CH8-n10">10</ref> Preserved, therefore, in the acts of the prototype of all church councils was this statement, incorporating the
               integral elements of our coin image. That this attitude toward the councils was not forgotten may be demonstrated by the letter of Eutychius to
                  <persName>Pope</persName> Vigilius, included in the Acts of the Fifth Council <pb n="94"/> of 553. which describes the councils as
               continuing the work of the propagation of the Faith begun by Christ and His Apostles.<ref target="#CH8-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It must not be forgotten, moreover, that the church councils were considered in themselves, and in their published acts, as fundamental <hi rend="italic">symbols</hi> of the orthodox faith; this is borne out by the history of the diptychs and of the images of these councils, at the
               very period we are studying. When the ephemeral emperor Philippicus <persName>Bardanes</persName> came to the throne following <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, he sought to restore the condemned Monothelete heresy;<ref target="#CH8-n12">12</ref> one of his most significant acts while striving to achieve this aim was the destruction of the images of the Six Oecumenical
               Councils, which had hitherto stood in the vestibule of the Great Palace between the Fourth and the Sixth Schola. Philippicus proceeded to erect
               at the Milion, the civic heart of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>, a new image which included only the first five of the councils, those
               which had not anathematized his theology. When he sent to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> to command <persName>Pope</persName>
               <persName>Constantine</persName> (who had barely returned from his visit to <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian
                  II</persName> at <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>) to perform the same purge on the similar images of the councils which existed there,
               the <persName>Pope</persName> refused to act, and an enraged populace substituted the image of the Sixth Council for the customary "sacred"
               portrait which had been set up to represent the heretical emperor.<ref target="#CH8-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>What, then, of the Christ before Whom the apostolic emperor stands in reverence? We have seen that the history of this Rex Regnantium image was
               prolonged into the post-Iconoclastic period, and that there is an excellent possibility that its history prior to the time of the issue of these
               coins can be determined. This is Christ the King of Those Who Rule, Christ in His aspect of Pambasileus, with His power related directly to that
               of the emperor, ruling through the emperor over the races of men. The Rex Regnantium concept has never been more accurately defined than it was
               by a <persName>Pope</persName>, <persName>Leo II</persName>, <pb n="95"/> writing to <persName corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</persName> in May of 682 to acknowledge receipt of the Acts of the Sixth Council, and to indicate
               his endorsement of their contents.<ref target="#CH8-n14">14</ref>
               <persName>Pope Leo</persName> was, of course, reminding the emperor of his responsibilities to his Heavenly superior; but what could be more
               fitting to our interpretation of the image than the first words of his letter: "Small and great we thank the king of those who rule, in whose
               power are the kingdoms of this world, and who has thus invested you with the earthly empire..."?<ref target="#CH8-n15">15</ref> "You rule by
               virtue of the mandate which has been sent to you by God."<ref target="#CH8-n16">16</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Herein lies the distinction between the Pantocrator, the Sovereign of all men, and the Rex Regnantium. This is not God the Father, visible
               through the form of His Son, on these coins, as the Iconophiles described the concept of the Pantocrator when they evolved tfyeir aesthetic of
               representation in the eighth century;<ref target="#CH8-n17">17</ref> this is the Son <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> Himself, Whose
               servant <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> proclaims himself to be.</p>
            <p>The words of <persName>Leo II</persName> seem, indeed, to combine in a most happy way the concepts with which we have been dealing. Using
               almost the very words of <persName>Justin II</persName>,<ref target="#CH8-n18">18</ref> on the occasion of the conclusion of an oecumenical
               council, within the very lifetime of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> the Pope gives expression to the
               meaning of the Rex Regnantium image in the most cogent way possible. It is not surprising to find that <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> adopted this sponsorship of the emperor's Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, Who
               makes His power felt on earth through the basileus, His representative and regent.<ref target="#CH8-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Justinian II's</persName> council concerned itself with defining the nature of the worship to be offered through images to Christ
               the Son. It is this Son of God Whom <persName>Justinian</persName> served, therefore, in regulating the faith of the orthodox, and in
               publishing the Canons of his Church Council; <pb n="96"/> and this act of service, or apostleship, is the one commemorated on <persName>Justinian II's</persName> coins of Type II.</p>
            <p>Type III, (<ref target="#fig-9">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 7</ref>) on the other hand, seems not so clearly defined, and in a certain sense may always defy any
               absolutely precise interpretation. The emperor no longer addresses Christ, but speaks to men,<ref target="#CH8-n20">20</ref> and all aspects of
               the reverse type serve to confirm our suggestion that these coins were issued after <persName>Justinian II's</persName> recapture of the
               throne in 705 A. D. He appears to his subjects, clad as before, but holding, in place of the mappa-anexikakia, a globus cruciger which proclaims
               that Peace has been restored to the world by the vindication of the legitimate dynasty. So his subjects receive him with the fitting salutation,
               "Lord for many Years," an invocation of a long and fortunate reign for the restored basileus. The sense of dynastic continuity is stressed,
               shortly, by the inclusion of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> infant son <persName corresp="#nomisma_tiberius">Tiberius</persName>,
               who was raised to the rank of Augustus at an uncommonly early age. In the idea of legitimacy, the reestablishment of the rightful dynastic
               succession, if we are correct in our dating and in our interpretation of this type, lies the key to an understanding of these coins.</p>
            <p>The changed Christ indicates the passage of time since the minting of Type II. The information which we possess on this portrait-type, complete
               though it may be in one sense, does not tell us why it should have been used on this coin; it certainly does not represent any stricter adherence
               to the Eighty-Second Canon of the Quinisexte Council than the previous Rex Regnantium portrait, since the Canon simply calls for the
               representation of Christ "in human form,"<ref target="#CH8-n21">21</ref> and not according to any given portrait-tradition.</p>
            <p>This is a different Christ, however, from our Pambasileus, the Christ of the emperors, for despite the persistence of the legend Rex Regnantium,
               He does not stand for the divinely-sanctioned aspect of the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> imperium in the same sense as does the Christ of
               our Type II. <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> here rules in his own right, directly over his people; the
               obverse legend recalls the principle of the super-magistracy <pb n="97"/> of Christ, but the coin as a whole does not assert this so much as the
               power of the emperor himself; in a sense, therefore, it may be still more imperialistic a conception, in the strictest sense of the word, than
               was Type II.</p>
            <p>No more than it prescribes a single specific portrait-type of Christ, does Canon 82 limit to a single fashion the manner in which Christ may be
               depicted. We are already familiar with occasional instances of the appearance of more than one portrait-type of Christ within the same
               iconographic formula, as if in order to illustrate the multiple theological concepts involved in the personality of the Son of Man.<ref target="#CH8-n22">22</ref> We have no evidence, however, that such an idea was operative in the creation of these new coin-types; still it is
               not beyond the realm of possibility that some such conception was present within their creators' minds.</p>
            <p>While this concept may only be suggested, we have already indicated that the <placeName>Syrian</placeName> parentage of the Christ-portrait of
               Type III may have played a part in its selection for this issue, at a time when <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian
                  II</persName> had in mind a reconciliation with the papacy (even though it must be remembered that his method was not one of mere appeasement—<hi rend="italic">vide</hi> his sending the blinded ex-Patriarch <persName>Callinicus</persName> as one of his ambassadors to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>). Beyond this we know too little of the history and associations of this portrait-type to
               arrive at a positive conclusion about its significance on this coin.</p>
            <p>One possibility suggests itself, however, in view of the nature of the reverse type, and the general content of the coin as a whole: The idea of
               the image "from the life" is closely linked with a series of other portraits or images of Christ, such as the Sacred Image of <placeName>Edessa</placeName> and that of <placeName>Camuliana</placeName>, which had become famous in the preceding century,<ref target="#CH8-n23">23</ref> and which were part of a whole family of portraits which either were supposed to be physical imprints of <pb n="98"/> Christ's
               living body made during His lifetime, or miraculously brought into existence at a later date. It has already been suggested that these images,
               which came from the general region of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254930">Palestine</placeName>, were related to the numerous descriptions of the appearance of Christ "more familiar in the time of the Saviour,"<ref target="#CH8-n24">24</ref> and which seem to originate in about the same period as that of the rise of the "acheiropoietai," as the miraculous
               images themselves were called.<ref target="#CH8-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These images were regarded in the seventh century, furthermore, as having palladian or apotropaeic powers. The Image of <placeName>Edessa</placeName> was credited with saving that city in the great <placeName>Persian</placeName> siege of 544;<ref target="#CH8-n26">26</ref>
               while the <placeName>Camuliana</placeName> portrait was used in 586 to instil courage in the imperial troops before battle.<ref target="#CH8-n27">27</ref> But most significant of all, <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>, founder of the
               dynasty to which <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> belonged, seems to have been a particularly fervent
               believer in the efficacy of such miraculous auxiliaries:<ref target="#CH8-n28">28</ref> He displayed the icon of the Virgin during his naval
               expedition to overthrow <persName>Phocas</persName>; he used the miraculous image of Christ–it has been suggested<ref target="#CH8-n29">29</ref> that this may have been the very image of <placeName>Camuliana</placeName> which had been brought from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> in 574, during the reign of <persName>Justin
                  II</persName>
               <ref target="#CH8-n30">30</ref>–as a palladium in his <placeName>Persian</placeName> campaign; and he had the same image carried around the
               walls of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> during the Avar siege of 626. As late as the Moslem siege of 717, in the reign of the future
               Iconoclast <persName corresp="#nomisma_leo_iii">Leo III</persName>, the image of the Virgin, as well as the relics of the True Cross, were
               carried around the walls of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> in an effort to obtain spiritual aid against the enemy.<ref target="#CH8-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We have already suggested that <persName>Justinian I</persName>Ps Christ-type B might represent one of these miraculous images; yet we face
               the <pb n="99"/> fact that none of the surviving copies of these images show the curly-haired "<placeName>Syrian</placeName>" Christ portrait;
               on the contrary, they are of a long-bearded wavy-haired type derived, like the normal mid-<placeName>Byzantine</placeName> type which they
               closely resemble, ultimately from our Christ-type A and its <persName>Greco-Roman</persName> antecedents.<ref target="#CH8-n32">32</ref> Our
               coin-type does correspond, however, with the written description of one of these pre-Iconoclastic acheiropoietai, the one in <persName>S. Sophia</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</placeName> which was described by <persName>Anthony of
                  Placentia</persName> in the sixth century.<ref target="#CH8-n33">33</ref> We should like to offer the hypothesis that this coin image does, in
               fact, copy one of the pre-Iconoclast miraculous images which played so large a part in the early development of the cult of the icons.</p>
            <p>The most famous of these pre-Iconoclastic acheiropoietai was the Image of <persName>Camuliana</persName>, of which no replica has been
               preserved. It would appear to have been lost or destroyed during the iconoclastic period; its place in the popular imagination as a "living"
               facsimile of Christ's appearance was taken by the Edessan image, which was brought to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> in its turn in
                  944.<ref target="#CH8-n34">34</ref> This image, insofar as we are able to infer its probable appearance,<ref target="#CH8-n35">35</ref> seems
               to have conformed to the normal mid-<placeName>Byzantine</placeName> Christ-portrait, as exemplified by the enthroned Christ of <persName>Hagia Sophia</persName>, the coin-types of the tenth century, and the many familiar icons of this and later times. All this is in
               contrast with the pre-Iconoclastic era, when there <pb n="100"/> apparently was no feeling of difficulty in reconciling multiple types of
               Christ-image, youthful and mature, beardless and bearded, and so forth.</p>
            <p>Despite the apparent standardization which took place in visual imagery after Iconoclasm, we have seen that at least a literary tradition
               persisted concerning the "familiar" appearance of Christ, corresponding in no way with the customary pictorial image, and apparently connected
               with the region where the miraculous images themselves originated. It is our hypothesis, then, that <persName>Justinian II's</persName>
               Christ-type B, which corresponds to this description, is linked to these miraculous images–most probably to the <placeName>Camuliana</placeName> portrait, since that was present in the capital at this time–and was used, as much as anything else, because of its strongly
               palladian connotations, as a "figure" of Christ invoked in aid of the rightful dynasty.</p>
            <p>The association of such miraculous images with the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>, as we have seen,
               also suggests that this may be another aspect of the strongly "dynastic" feeling of <persName>Justinian II's</persName> coins of Types III
               and IV; and there is one other detail of these coins which might also indicate this. We refer to the "patriarchal" cross with double crossbar,
               the history of which, together with its original meaning, seems never to have been thoroughly studied.<ref target="#CH8-n36">36</ref> What we <pb n="101"/> do know about it is that all the earliest surviving reliquaries for fragments of the True Cross take this shape: The Poitiers
               Reliquary, which legend says was sent to <persName>St. Radegund</persName> by <persName>Justin II</persName> about 569;<ref target="#CH8-n37">37</ref> the Fieschi-Morgan Reliquary, which <persName>Rosenberg</persName> dated in the pre-Iconoclastic period;<ref target="#CH8-n38">38</ref> and the Staurothek of Limburg, which surely dates from the tenth century.<ref target="#CH8-n39">39</ref> (Although
               there remain unresolved disagreements among students of the problem as to the pre-Iconoclastic dating of the first two reliquaries, no one has
               questioned the fact that these three are all Eastern cross-reliquaries preserved from before the year 1000 A. D., and that the two-barred form
               seems to be the one normally taken by such early Eastern reliquaries.)</p>
            <p>It is significant, in this connection, that this form may be the one described by the pilgrim <persName>Arculf</persName> when speaking of
               the reliquary of the True Cross which he saw during his visit to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> about the year 670.<ref target="#CH8-n40">40</ref>
               <persName>Arculf</persName> writes of the extreme veneration shown by all, and particularly by the imperial family, for the relics which
               were preserved in an unnamed round church, and then gives an involved description of the way in which these relics were enshrined. Unfortunately,
               the details of his description are too confused for the modern mind to be able to reconstruct the precise shape of the reliquary; but what <persName>Arculf</persName> makes clear is that the relics of the Cross were in three pieces, which were somehow shown in combination. A cross
               with double bars would seem one of the few possible ways in which such a combination of three pieces of a cross could be mounted together.</p>
            <p>Once more we are reminded of the actions of <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>, for it was that emperor who brought
               back these very relics of the True Cross <pb n="102"/> to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> after his first <placeName>Persian</placeName> campaign.<ref target="#CH8-n41">41</ref> If we are justified in thinking that there is some connection between <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName> transfer of the cross relics to his capital, and <persName>Justinian
                  II's</persName> use of a type of cross which seems to have been particularly associated with the True Cross to surmount the globus of world
               dominion on his coins, this would relate to two interconnected ideas: that this emblem of the True Cross was another symbol evoking dynastic
               associations with the glories of the founder, <persName corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</persName>, upon which <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> wished to fall back with his own return to power; and that the Holy Cross, too, had strong
               palladian powers to protect the Empire and its ruler–this latter fact being confirmed by the use of the relics a few years later, during the
               siege of 717.</p>
            <p>The "life" image of Christ, then, would appear as a suitable complement to that of the emperor on the third issue of coins by <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, at the outset of his second reign. While the emperor is acclaimed by his subjects, and
               presents himself to them as the legitimate heir of the <placeName>Heraclian dynasty</placeName>, the bestower of peace upon a world troubled
               by rebellion, usurpation and heresy within, paganism and barbarity without the Empire, the image of the miracle-working Christ is invoked to
               protect Justinian, his family and his realm from these threats, and to assure the Peace which is as much requested as proclaimed by the
               legend.</p>
            <p>This interpretation makes comprehensible the acceptance of this issue in papal territories, despite its potent assertion of the imperial right to
               world dominion. Type II represents the emperor's sacerdotal office together with his secular one, and hence seemed to the Italians to challenge
               the freedom of the Holy See to interpret orthodoxy according to its own lights. On Type III, on the other hand, the emperor, however divinely
               endowed with power, is shown as purely a lay sovereign, who appeals to Christ rather than represents Him invoking the aid of the Son of God to
               protect his Empire from danger and to continue his imperial house in power.<ref target="#CH8-n42">42</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="103"/>
            <p>A review of the "after-life" of these types, in the light of <persName>Grabar's</persName> recent discussion,<ref target="#CH8-n43">43</ref>
               serves to emphasize the importance they had for later periods of <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> art and numismatics. The immediate
               successors of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>, of course, rejected these types with their strong dynastic
               associations; shortly afterward, Iconoclasm removed the possibility of such iconic representations on official issues. Nor is it perhaps as
               strange as <persName>Grabar</persName> seems to feel<ref target="#CH8-n44">44</ref> that, during the brief periods under <persName>Artavasdus</persName> and <persName>Irene</persName> when iconophile sentiments once more were resurgent,<ref target="#CH8-n45">45</ref> the
               major step of replacing Christ on the official coinage did not take place. Only some time after <persName corresp="#nomisma_michael_iii">Michael III</persName> and <persName>Theodora</persName> had finally overthrown the Iconoclastic policies was this done.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, however, the formulation of iconophile doctrine, in the face of Iconoclast attacks, had brought to the fore the whole problem of
               the sovereignty of Christ; one of the major points inveighed against the Iconoclast emperors by their opponents was their denial of Christ's
                  overlordship,<ref target="#CH8-n46">46</ref> and the most concrete evidence brought to bear in support of this was the fact that these
               emperors, on their coins, had "replaced" the image of Christ with their own!<ref target="#CH8-n47">47</ref> And in the famous letter of the Three
               Eastern Patriarchs to The-ophilus, last of the Iconoclast emperors, there was described a coin of <persName>Constantine</persName> the Great
               on which the first Christian emperor depicted <pb n="104"/> not only himself, but Christ and the Cross as well.<ref target="#CH8-n48">48</ref>
               While this coin (or seal), if it really existed at the time, must have been a fabrication,<ref target="#CH8-n49">49</ref> it surely was evoked,
               and its description inspired, by surviving coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName>.</p>
            <p>When the time came that the <placeName>Byzantines</placeName> could once more venerate religious images, it was in imperial circles that the
               most prompt action would seem to have been taken,<ref target="#CH8-n50">50</ref> and on the coins that one of the earliest reappearances of the
               image of Christ took place.<ref target="#CH8-n51">51</ref> To account for the fact that one of Justinian's Christ-types, and not the other, or
               both of them, was used, we may suggest several complementary reasons: the disappearance of the <placeName>Camuliana</placeName> icon, and the
               general suppression of religious images over more than a century, which led to a lack of familiarity with the wealth of pre-Iconoclastic imagery;
               at the same time, the permanent separation from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254930">Palestine</placeName>, now of long standing; and the fact that iconophile theory, as worked out, by <persName>John of Damascus</persName> and his followers, tended to favor the establishment of one standard portraittype as the "true" one. In the outcome,
               the more familiar "pambasileus" image –closer in physical type to the bulk of the population and evoking the sovereignty of Christ which had
               become so important –won the favor of the first artists, and became the norm.<ref target="#CH8-n52">52</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, while it is incontrovertible that the new types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> were not
               conceived originally with any relationship to the problems of the Iconoclastic Controversy–were not, essentially, vehicles of theological ideas
               at all, but purely of political doctrine<ref target="#CH8-n53">53</ref>–they nevertheless played a key part in the resolution of that
               Controversy, and thus in the working out of the orthodox program of the place of religious art in the practice of the Christian Faith. Few, if
               any, numismatic issues can have had at any time so important a part to play in the history of human thought.</p>

                  and placed in the <placeName>Blachernae</placeName> church. He sees the anomalous issue of <persName>Leo VI</persName> with the Virgin
                     (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. II, Pl. LI, 8) as a posthumous one struck at the same time—with the Blacherniotissa image as its source for
                  the Virgin type. The theory is a striking one, which merits consideration, especially since it offers the first reasonable explanation of the

                  <persName>Mr. P. Verdier</persName> has brought to my attention a group of studies of the "Cross of Lorraine" or <placeName>Anjou</placeName>, stimulated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> by the events of World War II. These include: <persName>L. Courant</persName>, <hi rend="italic">La vraie Croix de Baugé</hi>. . ., Baugé, 1945; <persName>A. Couson</persName>, <hi rend="italic">L'histoire de la croix de Lorraine</hi>, <persName>Lille</persName>, 1945; <persName>F. de Grandmaison</persName>,
                     <hi rend="italic">L'héroique épopée de la croix de Lorraine et d'<placeName>Anjou</placeName>
                  </hi>, Saumur, 1945; C. du Mesnil, "Emblémes et drapeaux. La croix de Lorraine," <hi rend="italic">Revue de l'histoire de l'Armée</hi> I, 1945
                  pp. 9–22; <hi rend="italic">idem.,</hi> "La croix Lorraine," <hi rend="italic">Bulletin de la Société nationale des Antiquaires de <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>,</hi> 1945–47, pp. 42f. Of these, only Couson has been available to me in other
                  than summary form; but the tenor seems to follow one line: The cross of Lorraine, originally the double-barred cross on the arms of <placeName>Anjou</placeName>, derives from a cross reliquary made for the <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> emperor Manuel Comnenus
                  (1143–1180), which was brought back from the Crusades by <persName>Jean d'Alluye</persName>, and is now in the chapel of the Hospice at
                  Baugé. Thus we would appear to have another example to add to those cited below, of cross-reliquaries of the double-barred form, linked
                  directly with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>. <persName>A. Frolow</persName> has now
                  undertaken a general study of the early cross-reliquaries which, when completed, should clarify many of the problems in this area.</p>
               <p>It may be noted that <persName>Grabar</persName>, <hi rend="italic">L'iconoclasme,</hi> p. 40, connects the doublebarred cross on the
                  coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_justinian_ii">Justinian II</persName> with the one customarily held by Christ in mid-<placeName>Byzantine</placeName> and later scenes of the Anastasis, the Harrowing of Hell. While there is undoubtedly a connection, we should
                  prefer to think of a link through the common source, i. e., that in both instances it is meant to emphasize the fact that it is the True
                  Cross, the actual instrument of the Crucifixion, which is being used.</p>

               <p>Although <persName>Grabar</persName>, <hi rend="italic">L'iconoclasme</hi>, pp. 41ff., is led to different conclusions about the meaning
                  and purpose of our two types of coins, his analysis of the Christ-types is not far from the one arrived at here. He sees our Christ-type B,
                  with curly beard, as the "historical" Christ, the Prince of Peace, the Incarnate Son, Christ of the Redemption; while our Christ-type A, with
                  long flowing beard, is the King of Glory, Christ of the Second Coming. Thus there is a sort of dichotomy present between the human and the
                  divine aspects of the personality of Christ, as between one and the other portrait. While we doubt that contemporary orthodox theology would
                  have permitted an intention to represent one aspect of Christ's Person exclusively without the other, we can agree upon the nature of the
                  emphasis in each case.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Revue Numismatique</hi>, 1914, pp. 207ff. &amp; Pl. VII, 3, which bears on one side the image of Christ in the version of

                  portrayed in the style of Iconoclast coins of the eighth century. <persName>Grabar</persName> argues, p. 129, that this is most probably

                  anti-Iconoclast emblem might have been issued by him also, in the name of the Copronymus. In either case, this is an official use of the image

                  <persName>Grabar</persName>, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> p. 45, having linked our Christ-type B with the Quinisexte Council, suggests
                  that it was dropped after 843 because the problems of the Quinisexte were no longer pertinent to the post-Iconoclastic period. This view seems
                  to us questionable at best, regardless of our interpretation of the coin type; church canons do not go out of fashion or become obsolete in
                  any case, and the pronouncements of the Quinisexte would seem to have been very much alive only a very short time earlier.</p>
