The exhibition was a matter of national pride for the still relatively young nation, one intended to demonstrate the progress of American industry and culture to the world. As the exhibition was coming together, the New York Clipper newspaper editorialized that: “It has been suggested, and the suggestion meets with general favor, that arrangements be entered into with Barnum, to get his consent to have himself placed over the principal entrance to the Crystal Palace, as the greatest specimen of American manufacture to be found in this country.” Although perhaps in jest, the idea that Barnum, or more particularly the brand of commercial popular culture he personified, was the singular contribution of the United
States to the world was a remarkably perceptive observation.</abstract><originInfo><dateIssued>2010</dateIssued></originInfo><language><languageTerm>en</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><internetMediaType>application/pdf</internetMediaType></physicalDescription><location><url>docs/Wittmann-Empire_of_Culture.pdf</url></location><accessCondition xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0">Attribution-NonCommercial CC BY-NC</accessCondition><recordInfo><recordContentSource>American Numismatic Society</recordContentSource><recordCreationDate encoding="iso8601">2015-09-11</recordCreationDate><recordIdentifier>wittmann_empire_of_culture</recordIdentifier></recordInfo><subject><topic authority="lcsh" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh96008487">Circus workers</topic></subject><subject><topic authority="lcsh" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh96009616">Entertainment events</topic></subject><subject><geographic authority="tgn" valueURI="http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7023902">Hawaii</geographic></subject><subject><geographic authority="tgn" valueURI="http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/1000226">New Zealand</geographic></subject><subject><temporal authority="aat" valueURI="http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300021235">Late Victorian</temporal></subject></mods></modsCollection>
